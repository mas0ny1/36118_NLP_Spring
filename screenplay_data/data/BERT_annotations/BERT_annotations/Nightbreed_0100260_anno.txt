scene_heading: Scene 1. TITLE SEQUENCE
dialog: 
text: Darkness. Then, a burst of sparks from a bowl held in a scaly hand.
text: The light shows us a mural. We start to move along the wall. First we
text: see stars and planets, painted in a primitive, stylized fashion on
text: bare rock. A voice on the track speaks softly to us.
dialog: 
dialog: VOICE: We did not always live in hiding.
dialog: 
text: We have come to the image of a huge family tree, which springs from
text: a single seed but divides into two separate halves. On the left,
text: ruled by the moon, the branches blossom into extraordinary creatures.
text: On the right, by sunlight, the branches end in ordinary human beings.
dialog: 
text: Upon the word Nightbreed the title comes up on the screen, against
text: the image of a moon painted on the wall.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCENES 2-2K Deleted
dialog: 
scene_heading: 2L. EXT. REEDS NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Cut to a real moon. Then cut wide to a moonlit landscape, through
text: which the camera careens madly. The soundtrack, which was lush and
text: almost sacred in the mural chamber, erupts into a tribal rhythm. We
text: glimpse creatures in the darkness, moving through the reeds. They are
text: barely more than silhouettes. We see teeth, and gleaming eyes;
text: glimpses of naked, patterned flesh. Only glimpses.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 2M. INT. MURAL CHAMBER
dialog: 
text: Cut back to the mural chamber. Now we have moved away from the tree
text: to a more brutal scene. A symbolic representation of a great
text: apocalyptic war between Naturals and Breed. Terrible scenes of
dialog: destruction.
dialog: 
dialog: VOICE: But the Naturals made war on us. They feared us for our
dialog: strength. They envied our powers. They called us monsters, killing us
dialog: by whatever means their malice could invent, finding in each of us
dialog: our particular vulnerability.
dialog: 
text: We are scanning scenes of that war. A breed being staked like a
text: vampire. Another being shot like a werewolf. Another exposed to
dialog: sunlight.
dialog: 
dialog: VOICE: None of us was safe. The tribes of the moon dwindled. Our
dialog: gods were slaughtered, our homes destroyed. It was the Apocalypse.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 2N. EXT. NECROPOLIS WALL AND GATES
dialog: 
text: Cut back to the landscape. The clouds roil above the heads of the
text: creatures heading through the reeds. We see their destination now. A
text: huge wall, with gates.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 2P. INT. MURAL CHAMBER
dialog: 
text: And back to the mural chamber, and a final scene. The gates we've
text: just seen are in the painting. Looking over them, calling the Breed
text: in, is a vast indistinct form: that of Baphomet. His eyes burn; his
text: arms are open in welcome.
dialog: 
dialog: VOICE: Only one of our Gods survived the holocaust. Baphomet.
text: Wounded and near death, he summoned us, the last of the last, into
text: hiding. Into Midian, where we wait now. The battle is over but not
dialog: the war. There will come a saviour.
dialog: 
text: Now we've moved beyond the image of the gate into a new patch of
text: wall on which the pictures are only vague sketches. We can interpret
text: some of the images nevertheless: a man with a bloody hole in the
text: middle of his chest. A man wearing a mask like a skull. We linger on
text: a faceless figure.
dialog: 
dialog: VOICE: His name is Cabal. He will lead and give us back the Night.
dialog: We are the tribes of the moon. We are the Nightbreed.
dialog: 
text: The titles end.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 2Q. EXT. NECROPOLIS WALL AND GATES
dialog: 
text: Cut back to the landscape. Now we are at the gates, and the
text: creatures slip through and away into the mist. Only one, a beautiful,
text: ferocious female called Shuna Sassi remains, turning to look at us.
text: She beckons.
dialog: 
dialog: SHUNA: Come...
dialog: 
text: The camera retreats from her.
dialog: 
dialog: SHUNA: Will you not come?
dialog: 
text: Now the last of the creatures, the Drummer, takes her by the arm,
text: snatching her away through the gates. As she disappears, the camera
text: follows again, stopping at the gates themselves, which close with an
dialog: unearthly din.

dialog: 
text: C.U. on Boone, closed eyes. He is dreaming. His gaze roves beneath
text: his lids.
dialog: 
text: Lori's lips come into shot kissing first his eyes and then traveling
text: down his face to his mouth.
dialog: 
dialog: LORI: Boone...wake up.
dialog: 
text: Boone's eyes flicker open.
dialog: 
dialog: LORI: Hi. You OK?
dialog: 
dialog: Boone: Yep.
dialog: 
text: Now Boone's eyes are fully open. He sits up. Looks towards the open
text: window. Night beyond. She kisses him, distracting him from the sight
text: of the window.
dialog: 
dialog: LORI: You want something to eat?
dialog: 
dialog: BOONE: Sure. What time is it?
dialog: 
dialog: LORI: Nine-thirty. I was letting you doze.
dialog: 
dialog: BOONE: Thought you'd worn me out, huh?
dialog: 
text: Lori smiles, and kisses him, then crosses the room to the kitchen
text: area, picks up some fruit, and a knife, carrying both back to where
text: Boone is lying on the bed. It is unmade. Both Lori and Boone are
text: lightly dressed, clothes casually thrown on after an afternoon
dialog: lovemaking.
dialog: 
dialog: Lori: You know what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOONE: What?
dialog: 
dialog: LORI: We should get out of Calgary for a few days. Just take off.
dialog: 
dialog: BOONE: Anywhere special?
dialog: 
dialog: LORI: Somewhere we can be alone together.
dialog: 
dialog: BOONE: More alone than this?
dialog: 
dialog: LORI: Yeah. Just you and me. No work. No telephone calls. No...
dialog: 
dialog: BOONE: Bad dreams.
dialog: 
dialog: LORI: No bad dreams.
dialog: 
dialog: BOONE: How did you know?
dialog: 
dialog: LORI: I know. I always know. It's no big deal.
dialog: 
text: BOONE: I'm going around in some crazy loop in my head.
dialog: 
dialog: LORI: You're not crazy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOONE: No.
dialog: 
dialog: LORI: Say it like you mean it.
dialog: 
dialog: BOONE: I believe it. I'm not crazy. But I want this damn dream out
dialog: of my head.
dialog: 
text: He gets up and goes to the window.
dialog: 
dialog: BOONE: Decker's started calling me again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LORI: When?
dialog: 
dialog: BOONE: All last week. Every day.
dialog: 
dialog: LORI: What does he want?
dialog: 
text: BOONE: I don't know. I haven't called him back.
dialog: 
dialog: LORI: If he can help, see him. Tell him it's all gone but the bad
dialog: dreams.
dialog: 
dialog: BOONE: They're not bad. That's what's weird. The more I have them
dialog: the more I like them. Now I do sound like a crazy, right?
dialog: 
dialog: LORI: No. You sound like the man I love. A little haunted, maybe,
dialog: but the sanest man I ever met.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOONE: Keep going.
dialog: 
dialog: LORI: Will you see Decker?
dialog: 
dialog: BOONE: You think I should?
dialog: 
dialog: LORI: Where's the harm? You tell him from me, I'm the only thing you
dialog: should be dreaming about.
dialog: 
dialog: BOONE: I don't think he'd get it. He never had a wet dream in his
dialog: life.
dialog: 
dialog: LORI: I don't want to be competing with things I can't see, Boone.
dialog: Can't share I don't want to be always feeling that something's
dialog: pulling at you.
dialog: 
dialog: BOONE: I'm not going anywhere, Lori. Except with you.
dialog: 
dialog: LORI: I can't hear that often enough.
dialog: 
dialog: BOONE: I'll never leave you. Not ever. I swear.
dialog: 
text: He kisses her, passionately.
dialog: 
dialog: BOONE: Can't remember a time when I didn't love you.
dialog: 
dialog: LORI: How about before we met?
dialog: 
dialog: BOONE: Even then.
dialog: 
text: They kiss again. We move past them into the darkness outside the

dialog: 
text: Melissa Rickman emerges from the lounge, with a Dagwood sandwich, a

dialog: 
dialog: MELISSA: Okay, you want ham, cheese, pickle, mustard?
dialog: 
dialog: LOU: All of the above and a brewski, thank you.

dialog: fat. I like you fat too...

dialog:

scene_heading: 18. INT. RICKMAN KITCHEN NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Melissa enters, moves out of sight. We stay at the door. A figure
text: appears dressed in black, knives in both hands, and crosses to leave
text: the screen again. We do not see his face. But we hear his labours:
text: the sound of the blades slicing Melissa. She staggers into view,
text: grabbing hold of her slit throat. Blood bubbles between her fingers.
text: The figure appears behind her. She turns, as the knife descends.

scene_heading: 21. INT. RICKMAN KITCHEN NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Lou reaches the kitchen door and sees Melissa laid out, dead, on the
dialog: kitchen table
dialog: 
dialog: LOU: Oh God - GOD!
dialog: 
text: Lou enters, the figure emerges from behind him. While we remain at
text: the door watching, detached, Lou fights back, throwing himself back
text: and forth around the kitchen. But the figure is much stronger. We
text: glimpse its face now, it is a mask, with a zipper for a mouth and
text: buttons for eyes, blank. Devoid of compassion, hatred or regret. A
text: death's head, made by a mad child.
dialog: 
text: Atop the stairs, Lou Two listens. His baby sister cries in her cot.
text: He looks her way then back downstairs. The sounds cease. Silence.
text: Terror on his face. Then the child's perfect nightmare appears at the
text: bottom of the stairs. The figure, heavy knife in hand, starts to
text: climb, dragging Lou's bloody body after him by the hair.

dialog: 
text: Close on a pile of tapes, marked with dates over a period of two

dialog: 
dialog: DECKER: I've been listening to the tapes of our sessions. All two
dialog: years' worth...
dialog: 
text: We move from the tapes to Decker, who gets up from his desk and
text: moves around to the other side. Boone is sitting on the other side of
text: the desk, his posture far from relaxed. He hates this room. As Decker
text: moves, we take in the various pictures on the walls. Dance pictures,
text: photographs of Decker with civic dignitaries, crippled children etc.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOONE: Why?
dialog: 
dialog: DECKER: Most of my colleagues would have walked away from a case
dialog: like yours. The most they would have done was drug you. But you...you
dialog: intrigued me. All the talk of monsters. And Midian. Remember Midian?
dialog: 
dialog: BOONE: That wasn't me. I heard about Midian from other people.
dialog: 
dialog: DECKER: But you made it part of your private mythology.
dialog: 
dialog: BOONE: I suppose I did. It was a place of refuge.
dialog: 
dialog: DECKER: When you imagined yourself being taken off to this invented
dialog: city, to Midian, what crimes were you going to be forgiven?
dialog: 
text: Boone's looking uneasy now. He wipes sweat from his upper lip.
dialog: 
dialog: BOONE: You know what I used to dream.
dialog: 
dialog: DECKER: Yes. There's a remarkable consistency in the images you see.
text: Great detail. Almost as though the violence was real.
dialog: 
dialog: BOONE: They were just bad dreams. Midian doesn't exist. Monsters
dialog: don't exist.
dialog: 
dialog: DECKER: But murder does, Boone. Murder's very real. It may start in
text: the mind, but it ends up changing to flesh and blood.
dialog: 
text: He picks up the envelope we saw in his previous scene, and takes the
dialog: photographs out.
dialog: 
dialog: DECKER [cont.]: Two days ago the police brought me some
dialog: photographs. They wanted to know if I had any patients who might be
dialog: capable of what's in these photographs. I'm going to show you them.
dialog: Are you ready for that?
dialog: 
text: Boone nods.
dialog: 
text: Decker lays the photographs on the table. Boone picks them up. We
text: get glimpses of what they contain. Domestic horrors. Bloody scenes of
text: corpses caught by the camera in grotesque positions, sliced up and
text: bleeding. Boone's breath quickens.
dialog: 
dialog: DECKER [cont.]: When you talk about murder on the tapes, I thought
dialog: it was invention. Now I'm not so sure.
dialog: 
text: Boone keeps staring at the pictures. The glassy eyes stare hard at
text: him. His breathing is now rapid and shallow. One or two of the images
text: seem to move. Bodies twitch. He drops the photographs.
dialog: 
dialog: BOONE: I didn't...
dialog: 
dialog: DECKER: Didn't what?
dialog: 
dialog: BOONE: They were bad dreams.
dialog: 
dialog: DECKER: What you describe in your sessions is very specific. Houses;
dialog: faces...
dialog: 
dialog: BOONE: I don't remember.
dialog: 
dialog: DECKER: You want to hear?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOONE: No!
dialog: 
text: Decker picks up the photographs. Boone, highly agitated, gets up and
text: paces the room.
dialog: 
dialog: BOONE[cont.]: You think I did this?
dialog: 
text: DECKER: Six families killed over a two year period. All within
dialog: driving distance of Calgary...
dialog: 
dialog: BOONE [fury]: Do you think I did this?
dialog: 
dialog: DECKER: I hope to God you didn't, for both our sakes. We've come a
dialog: long way together. I don't want to believe this any more than you do.
dialog: 
dialog: BOONE: But you do.
dialog: 
dialog: DECKER: I wouldn't put us through this pain if I didn't...if I
dialog: wasn't...afraid you had.
dialog: 
dialog: BOONE [desperate; helpless]: What do I do? God, tell me what to do.
dialog: 
dialog: DECKER: I can only go so far on your behalf. Patient
dialog: confidentiality's one thing. Protecting a killer is another.
dialog: 
dialog: BOONE [breaking down]: Jesus...Jesus...Jesus...
dialog: 
text: Decker returns to his desk. Puts the photographs down and picks up a
text: vial of prescription pills. He crosses to boone.
dialog: 
dialog: DECKER: Listen to me. Take these, they'll help. Go home, and
dialog: consider what we've talked about. I'm going to give you twenty-four
dialog: hours to go to the police and answer their questions of your own
dialog: accord. That's as long as I can give you. if you haven't complied by
dialog: then, I'm afraid I'll have to tell them what I know.

dialog: DOCTOR: You don't hit that altitude on lithium carbonate. Let's get
dialog: the prescribing doctor on the line... [finally - to Boone] Okay,
dialog: we're doing all right, aren't we? Tell me, what've you been taking
dialog: tonight, partner?

dialog: 
text: NARCISSE [V.O.] [muttering - half mumbled ranting]: Shit! Shit! Take
dialog: me, why don't you take me?
dialog: 
text: Boone opens his eyes. Looks across the room at Narcisse, a wild man,
text: half-derelict, half-punk, bloodied, his hand bandaged, pacing back
text: and forth like a caged cat, staring out of a large picture window at
dialog: the night.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 51. EXT. HOSPITAL WINDOW NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Looking in at the brightly lit window framed in the dark building,
text: as Narcisse restlessly moves across it, peering outside.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 52. INT. SEMI-PRIVATE HOSPITAL ROOM NIGHT
dialog: 
text: NARCISSE [low and anxious]: They've gone, they've gone, they were
dialog: here, they were coming for me, where'd they go? Shit!
dialog: 
dialog: BOONE: Hey...
dialog: 
text: NARCISSE [turns on him - viciously]: Shut up, shut up! They saw you,
dialog: they won't come while you're here, they won't show themselves to the
dialog: likes of you, don't you see that?
dialog: 
dialog: BOONE [placating - knows the type]: Sure, okay.
dialog: 
text: NARCISSE: Shit! I've missed them, I've missed them! You scared them
dialog: off, you kept them from me!
dialog: 
text: Narcisse paces again, starting to sob and sniffle. Boone leans back.
dialog: 
text: NARCISSE [cont.] [barely audible - between cries]:
dialog: ...Midian...Midian...
dialog: 
text: Boone's eyes open like a shot.
dialog: 
dialog: BOONE: What did you say?
dialog: 
dialog: NARCISSE: I said shut up, you want to ruin everything?
dialog: 
text: Boone leaps to his feet, grabs and easily overpowers the smaller man.
dialog: 
dialog: BOONE: What did you say, just now?
dialog: 
dialog: NARCISSE [suddenly friendly]: What did you say, just now?
dialog: 
dialog: BOONE: You said Midian.
dialog: 
dialog: NARICSSE [coyly]: Did I? Maybe...
dialog: 
dialog: BOONE [hurting him - desperate]: What do you know about it?
dialog: 
text: NARCISSE: It's where the monsters go. It takes away the pain...
dialog: 
text: Narcisse reaches his hands into his pockets, then comes out with
text: long, silver, razor-sharp artificial nails, curved like hooks,
text: attached to his thumbs. He holds them right at Boone's throat, ready
text: to cut. He smiles.
dialog: 
dialog: NARCISSE [cont.]: ...what do you know about it?
dialog: 
dialog: BOONE [pause; cautiously]: They forgive you there.
dialog: 
dialog: NARCISSE: Uh-huh. Ever kill anybody?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOONE: Yes.
dialog: 
dialog: NARCISSE: See, they only take you if you're worthy. You know what
dialog: they do to those that aren't worthy?
dialog: 
text: Boone shakes his head. Narcisse draws one razor-nail lightly across
text: his own throat. A thin trickle of blood runs down his neck. He
text: chuckles.
dialog: 
text: BOONE: It's real. Midian's real. [Narcisse nods; carefully] And you
dialog: know...where it is. Don't you? We could go there...
dialog: 
dialog: NARCISSE: They sent you. They sent you to take me.
dialog: 
dialog: BOONE: That's right. But first I need to know...you have to tell
dialog: me...where it is.
dialog: 
text: NARCISSE: It's a test? [Boone nods; Narcisse leans in to him -
dialog: whispers] No maps.
dialog: 
dialog: BOONE: But you do know. Don't you?
dialog: 
text: NARCISSE [looks around; leans in again]: North of Athabasca. East of
text: Peace River. Near Shere Neck, north of Dwyer.
dialog: 
text: Satisfied, Boone releases him, go back to the bed, collects his
dialog: jacket.
dialog: 
dialog: NARCISSE [cont.] [ exhilarated]: You'll take me with you, I'm
dialog: worthy, you ask anyone, I knew you'd come, they sent you to take me,
dialog: I was waiting. I know, I know, first I have to show you, that's how
dialog: it works.
dialog: 
text: Boone is looking out of the window in the door, sizing up his escape.
dialog: 
dialog: BOONE: Show me what?
dialog: 
dialog: NARCISSE: My true face. That's what there are for. [he raises his
dialog: bladed thumbs] So you can see. I'm not a natural man. Underneath I'm
dialog: a monster, that's how it works; I show you, then you take me with
dialog: you...
dialog: 
text: He puts the blade to either side of his face. We hear the skin pop.
dialog:

dialog: face.

dialog: schizophrenia at thirteen, juvenile delinquency, periodically
text: institutionalized through early adulthood...some violent episodes,
dialog: never criminally charged as an adult, he's been in my care for less

dialog: 
text: A bloodcurdling scream from the semi-private room rivets the
text: attention of the emergency room
dialog: 
scene_heading: 54. EXT. SEMI-PRIVATE ROOM NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Following the nurse and an intern as they burst into the room and
text: are greeted with the sight of Narcisse, blood running freely,
text: ripping the least of his scalp off his bare skull, laughing and
text: crying maniacally.
dialog: 
text: Boone stands near the door, horrified.
dialog: 
text: NARCISSE [variously]: TAKE ME! TAKE ME! I'M A MONSTER!
dialog: 
dialog: Nurse [over - to Boone] What the hell have you done?
dialog: 
dialog: Boone: Nothing!
dialog: 
text: INTERN: Fucking junkies! [at the door - yelling into the corridor]
dialog: Doctor!
dialog: 
text: As the door swings open, Boone looks out into the corridor and at
text: the far end of the emergency room he sees Decker and the cops looking
text: his way. Medical support move towards the room, as the nurse and
text: intern try to contain the ranting Narcisse.
dialog: 
text: Boone grabs a loose doctor's coat off the back of the door, slips it
text: on and backs out of the room.
dialog: 
dialog: BOONE: Let's get some help in here!
dialog: 
text: Pandemonium. Narcisse screams, as a half-dozen people struggle to
text: subdue him. As help continues to rush into the room, Boone slowly
text: backs away, out and around a corner. He stops beside a swinging door,
text: sensing something.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 55. EXT. SEMI-PRIVATE ROOM NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Dr Decker moving through emergency towards the mêlée, stops on the
text: other side of the swinging door, his senses lit up with alarm. He

dialog: 
scene_heading: 56. EXT. HOSPITAL NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Boone moves rapidly away from the exit into the parking lot, tossing
text: off the white coat, breaking into a run. He tries several car doors,
text: finds one open, gets in.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 57. INT. CAR NIGHT
dialog: 
text: With a rush of adrenal intensity, Boone expertly rips open an under
text: panel of the dash, locates and patches together the correct ignition

dialog: 
text: SURGEON: He's dying. I think he wants to die.
dialog: 
text: Pause. The surgeon moves on.
dialog: 
dialog: DECKER [unobtrusively - to Joyce]: Lieutenant, I know Boone, I know

dialog:

dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: 65. EXT. NECROPOLIS DAY
dialog: 
text: Necropolis, lying on the other side of a thick expanse of reeds.
dialog: 
text: Puzzlement overtakes despair. He squints to see more clearly...
dialog: 
text: The Necropolis is vast. High walls, surrounded by reeds, with the
text: tops of mausoleums, showing above it. ALmost a fortressed town.
dialog: 
text: Boone starts towards it.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 66. EXT. NECROPOLIS GATES DAY
dialog: 
text: The sun is low in the sky, the light golden glinting off the gates.
text: The reeds sigh. Boone pushes one of the gates open and steps inside.
text: His footsteps echo, unnaturally loud in this city of the dead. To
text: either side of him, elegant and elaborate mausoleums, running away
text: into the distance, with numerous smalls tombs set around and between
dialog: them.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The sun finally sinks out of sight. Its final glow dies on the tops
text: of the mausoleums. There are already stars overhead.
dialog: 
text: Boone walks on a little way, as the night sounds begin. Exhausted,
text: he sits down on a tomb and leans back against the stone.
dialog: 
text: BOONE [softly - a bitter irony]: Dead ... all of the dead ...
dialog: 
text: He rummages for a cigarette in his jacket pocket. Pulls one out.
text: Lights it. The flame seems to excite sounds around him. He looks up.
text: The walkways are empty in both directions.
dialog: 
text: There's a guttural sound at his back. He stands, drops the
text: cigarette, backs away. From the darkness behind him steps a huge
text: form. A knife is put to his lower belly. Its wielder, Kinski, is a
text: massive man, face distorted, his features grotesquely bifurcated.
dialog: 
dialog: KINSKI [whispers]: Move and I gut you.
dialog: 
text: Boone stays still. The growling from between the tombs becomes words.
dialog: 
dialog: VOICE [from the darkness]: You got him?
dialog: 
dialog: KINSKI: I got him.
dialog: 
text: A reptilian hand reaches out and picks up Boone's dropped cigarette.
dialog: 
dialog: BOONE: Midian? Are you from Midian?
dialog: 
dialog: KINSKI: We should take him below, Peloquin.
dialog: 
text: The silhouette of Peloquin, a were-creature, moves between the
text: tombs. He draws on the cigarette. By its brightening point we glimpse
text: an extraordinary face: more animal than human, but no recognizable
dialog: species.
dialog: 
text: PELOQUIN: He's not Nightbreed. He's Natural.
dialog: 
text: BOONE: No! I've killed people, I'm like you, that's why I'm here...
dialog: 
dialog: PELOQUIN: Shut the fuck up. You're meat.
dialog: 
dialog: KINSKI: If we eat him we break the Law.
dialog: 
dialog: BOONE: My God...my God, it's true ...
dialog: 
text: PELOQUIN: Of course it's true. Everything's true ... [he starts to
text: emerge from the shadows] God's an astronaut. Oz is over the rainbow.
dialog: And Midian's where the monsters live. And you came to die.
dialog: 
text: BOONE: I didn't...didn't come to die. I came to be with you, I'm one
dialog: of you.
dialog: 
text: Peloquin reaches out and touches Boone's chest.
dialog: 
text: PELOQUIN: No. Sorry. I can smell innocence at fifty yards.
dialog: 
dialog: BOONE: I've killed people. Fifteen people.
dialog: 
dialog: PELOQUIN: Who told you that?
dialog: 
dialog: BOONE: What do you mean?
dialog: 
dialog: PELOQUIN: He lied, asshole. He lied. You're a Natural. And that
dialog: means...you're meat for the Beast.
dialog: 
text: Peloquin growls, throwing his head back and forth with a strange
text: grace, the image flickering as he does so. Boone watches, amazed. In
text: the blur of Peloquin's motion he transforms, the tentacles on his
text: head lengthening and thickening, thrashing around as though they have
dialog: a life of their own.
dialog: 
text: He moves towards Boone, taking hold of him and tearing his T-shirt
dialog: open.
dialog: 
dialog: KINSKI: We mustn't. It's the Law. They'll exile us...
dialog: 
dialog: PELOQUIN: Fuck the Law! I want meat!
dialog: 
text: He bites Boone's neck, tearing at his flesh.
dialog: 
dialog: KINSKI: Peloquin, no!
dialog: 
text: Kinski takes the knife from Boone's belly and pushes Peloquin aside.
text: Boone slips away from them.
dialog: 
dialog: PELOQUIN: Damn you!

dialog:

dialog: 
text: A sound above him. He looks up. Peloquin is climbing down the
text: mausoleum wall, mouth opened wide to take off Boone's head.
text: Boone throws himself forward as the jaws snap shut, missing him by

dialog: 
text: KINSKI: He's gone, give it up! You don't dare go out there!
dialog: 
text: Peloquin stares at Boone through the gate. Panting, sweating, Boone
text: stares back. Snorting with frustration, Peloquin recedes, he and

text: into the darkness, when suddenly . . .
dialog: 
scene_heading: 71. EXT. OUTSIDE NECROPOLIS GATES NIGHT
dialog:

dialog: 
text: Boone squints against the glare.
dialog: 
dialog: JOYCE [cont.]: Aaron Boone, you're under arrest. Hands on your head!
dialog: NOW!
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: DECKER: Boone, listen to him, it's no use!
dialog: 
dialog: JOYCE [to Decker]: Stay back!

dialog: 
text: DECKER [pause; whispers]: What about them, Boone?
dialog: 
dialog: BOONE: They weren't tranquillizers...

scene_heading: 94. INT. MOTEL BAR NIGHT
dialog: 
text: A wood-panelled, Western Frontier-themed bar. Country music. A
text: banner welcomes rodeo participants. A number of rough types
text: clustered at tables, many of them wearing baseball caps adorned with
text: buffalo horns. Lori enters, looks around. A cowboy lassoes a
text: waitress, ropes her in to general applause. Lori takes a seat at the
text: bar and is approached by a bartender.
dialog: 
dialog: BARTENDER: What'll it be, darlin'?
dialog: 
dialog: LORI: A draft and some information please.
dialog: 
text: BARTENDER [taps a stein of draft]: There's the draft.

speaker_heading: LORI: No?

dialog: 
dialog: LORI: Baby-slasher?
dialog: 
dialog: BARTENDER: Yeah, hell of a week for us. The rodeo this weekend. That
dialog: scumbag gets blown away. I hear it took thirty slugs to bag that
dialog: sucker. Just goes to show you, don't it? People love a spectacle.
dialog: 
text: Lori's hit with a burst of emotion. She doesn't want the bartender

dialog: exits.
dialog: 
text: Lori pulls a tissue from her bag and tries to compose herself,
text: standing back to allow Sheryl access to the mirror, where she studied
text: herself before starting to tease her hair.
dialog: 
text: SHERYL: Which is it, hon', men or money? [Lori looks at her] It's
dialog: usually one or the other, ain't it?

dialog: SHERYL: Uh-huh. What'd he do, leave?

speaker_heading: LORI: Not exactly.

text: SHERYL: Jesus, did he come back? That's even worse.

dialog: 
dialog: SHERYL [cont.]: Some loser takes a shine to ya, you could toss
dialog: 'em in the river tied to a piano he'll come back faster than a dog
dialog: with a bone. Thing is, why go to all this trouble to look so good if
dialog: there's nobody to admire the end product, am I right?
dialog: 
dialog: LORI: Can't argue with that, [likes her, feeling lonely] Can I buy

scene_heading: 96B. INT. MURAL CHAMBER
dialog:

dialog: 
text: Cut to Narcisse and Boone, also approaching the chamber.

scene_heading: 96C. INT. INITIATION CHAMBER
dialog:

dialog: 
text: On Lylesburg's other side, Ohnaka. Standing around the walls as
text: witnesses to the ceremony, are a variety of Breed.
dialog: 
text: Boone enters. The Breed all look his way. Boone sees Shuna Sassi.
dialog: 
text: BOONE [to Narcisse in a whisper]: Who is she?
dialog: 
dialog: NARCISSE: Shuna Sassi. Why?
dialog: 
dialog: BOONE: I dreamt her.

dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: NARCISSE: Yes I have.
dialog: 
dialog: LYLESBURG: You understand what you do, becoming one of us? With this
dialog: night you turn your back on the Natural World. The
dialog: life you lived will after this be as a dream.
dialog: 
dialog: BOONE: I know.
dialog: 
text: Lylesburg takes the glove off his right hand. The flesh beneath is
text: cauterized.
dialog: 
text: LYLESBURG: The blood of the God tells all truths. It can harm as
dialog: easily as heal. Are you prepared to be judged?
dialog: 
dialog: BOONE: I'm ready.
dialog: 
text: Lylesburg nods, and puts his hand into the bowl of the blood. The
text: blood bubbles around his wrist.
dialog: 
text: We cut to Peloquin and Shuna Sassi, who are watching Boone intently.
dialog: 
text: Boone's eyes are now on Lylesburg's smoking hand as it approaches
text: Boone's chest, still marked by his wounds.
dialog: 
dialog: LYLESBURG: Be judged.
dialog: 
text: He puts his hand on the bullet wounds. Boone stiffens. But there's
text: no pain. When Lylesburg's hand is removed, the wounds have gone.
text: There's a visible release of tension on the faces of all those
dialog: watching.
dialog: 
text: LYLESBURG: Aaron Boone, in the name of Baphomet, Lord of the tribes

dialog: 
text: Lori parks the car. She gets out, looks around.
dialog: 
dialog: LORI [quiet - reflective]: Why? Why would Boone come here?
dialog:

scene_heading: 102. EXT. MIDIAN DAY
dialog: 
text: Sheryl - wandering from the car into the reeds. She lights a
text: cigarette, tunelessly humming to ward off the willies. She stops,
text: shivers, suddenly feeling very isolated. The atmosphere's got to her.
text: She starts back to the car.
dialog: 
text: She catches some movement out of the corner of her eye. Stops.
text: Slowly walks away from the movement, fighting off panic. She
text: turns a corner, and realizes she's lost in the reeds.
dialog: 
text: She hears movement behind her, turns, startled, then, oddly, she
text: smiles.
dialog: 
dialog: SHERYL: Curtis ... what are you doing here?
dialog: 
text: It's Decker, looking like a commuter, hair slicked back, wearing an

dialog: 
scene_heading: 103. EXT. NECROPOLIS GATES DAY
dialog: 
text: Lori reaches the gates, slightly breathless. She pushes one of them
text: open. The sun is hot and bright, transforming the Necropolis from the
dialog: dark, dangerous place it was when Boone was here. Now, with its
text: gothic tombs and burgeoning plant life, it's almost welcoming.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 104. EXT. NECROPOLIS DAY
dialog: 
text: Lori wanders the walkways, enchanted by the splendor of the place.
text: There are strange, bittersweet sights along the way: statues of dogs
text: sleeping on their masters' graves; of mourning mothers; of children,
text: sitting at their graves. And grotesque images too: gargoyles
text: protecting the doorways of mausoleums; a tiger, roaring in stone. It
text: is another world, solemn and silent.
dialog: 
text: Except...suddenly, the sound of an animal in pain. Lori stops and
text: looks around. Her gaze comes to rest on a spreading laurel tree
text: beneath which the shadows are pitch black. From here, the sobbing
text: comes. She approaches. There is an animal beneath the tree, barely
text: discernible. She can see its flanks panting, its head moving in pain.
dialog: 
dialog: LORI: Jesus...
dialog: 
text: It doesn't look like a recognizable species, an amalgam of wild cat
text: and deer. She approaches. It raises its head, weakly. Its eyes are
text: huge and black.
dialog: 
text: LORI [cont.]: ...It's okay, I won't hurt you...it's okay...
dialog: 
text: The creature shudders.
dialog: 
dialog: LORI [cont.]: ...What's happened to you?...Let me see.
dialog: 
text: She reaches beneath the branches and tentatively strokes the animal.
text: It responds by dropping its head back on to the grass.
dialog: 
text: LORI [cont.]: Oh God...you poor thing...don't die, please don't die.
dialog: 
text: She pushes beneath the tree, puts her arms beneath the creature and
text: picks it up. It is heavy, a dead weight in her arms. She backs out
text: from beneath the tree. As she steps back into the sun, the creature
text: snarls and starts to wither in her arms. She realizes what's causing
text: it pain and steps back into shadow.
dialog: 
dialog: LORI [cont.]: You don't like the sun? Is that it?
dialog: 
text: The sound of sobbing, off to her left, draws her attention. One of
text: the mausoleum doors is open, and a woman, Rachel, dressed in black,
text: stands in the shadows, weeping. Lori's astonished.
dialog: 
dialog: LORI [cont.]: I'm sorry...is, is it yours?
dialog: 
dialog: RACHEL: Bring her. Bring her, please.
dialog: 
text: Shading the creature from the sun, Lori moves to the door and steps
text: into the gloom.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 105. INT. MAUSOLEUM DAY
dialog: 
text: The interior is marble, the air murky. Rachel, a fine-boned, pre-
text: Raphaelite beauty in her thirties, moves back against the far wall,
text: nursing a wounded arm.
dialog: 
text: Lori looks down at the creature she's carrying, utterly limp in her
dialog: arms.
dialog: 
dialog: LORI: ...I'm afraid it's too late.
dialog: 
dialog: RACHEL: No...she can't die. Bring her to me, please.
dialog: 
text: Rachel reaches out. Lori's reluctant to move further into the
dialog: darkness.
dialog: 
dialog: RACHEL: Hurry!
dialog: 
text: As Lori crosses the floor, she hears whispering from a stairway that
text: leads down into the earth. She stops, frightened.
dialog: 
dialog: RACHEL: Pay no attention. Please, bring me my Babette.
dialog: 
text: As the creature is named it starts to move in Lori's arms. Not only
text: move, but change. Its claws grab at Lori's breast as it writhes.
dialog: 
dialog: RACHEL [cont.]: Babette, no!
dialog: 
dialog: LORI: What's happening?
dialog: 
dialog: RACHEL: Don't look! Don't look!
dialog: 
text: But Lori can't help but look. Appalled, she tries to pull the
text: transforming creature off her, but its hold is firm.
dialog: 
dialog: LORI: Jesus! Jesus!
dialog: 
text: With effort, she detaches the creature's claws from her, almost
text: throwing it at Rachel, who cradles the changing creature in her arms.
dialog: 
dialog: RACHEL: Babette...
dialog: 
text: Lori leans against the wall, trying to wipe the sticky fluids the
text: creature's exuded onto her hands. When she looks up she sees the
text: creature in Rachel's arms has transformed into a pale, beautiful girl
text: of seven or eight. Lori's dumbstruck.
dialog: 
dialog: LORI: What...what...what the...?
dialog: 
dialog: RACHEL: She likes to play outside. I tell her: you mustn't play in
dialog: the sun. The sun will hurt you. But she's just a child. She doesn't
dialog: understand.
dialog: 
text: Lori looks back towards the open door, and the sun-drenched walkway
text: outside. Then back at Babette.
dialog: 
dialog: LORI: This is too weird.
dialog: 
text: RACHEL [an urgent whisper]: You saved her. I owe you
dialog: something...listen; I know why you came here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LORI: You do?
dialog: 
dialog: RACHEL: You must go, this place is not for you. Midian is a home for
text: the Nightbreed. Only for the Nightbreed.
dialog: 
dialog: LORI: Is Boone here? Did somebody bring him here?
dialog: 
text: A deep baritone voice rises up from the shadows of the stairwell.
dialog: 
dialog: LYLESBURG: Rachel...you have said too much already.
dialog: 
text: Lylesburg appears, a commanding, magisterial man with a vast grey
text: beard and three slits on each cheek that look like gills. Loping
text: along beside him, his fool, a muscular man with an innocently
text: beautiful face: Ohnaka.
dialog: 
dialog: RACHEL: My Lylesburg, she brought me Babette, she saved her . . .
dialog: 
dialog: LYLESBURG: We know. But you cannot help her.
dialog: 
dialog: LORI [her spunk surfacing]: Look, I saved the child's life, don't I
dialog: deserve something for that?
dialog: 
text: LYLESBURG: The child has no life to save, [he looks at her - sizes
dialog: her up] But what she has is yours, if you want it. That's the Law. Do
dialog: you want her?
dialog: 
dialog: LORI: No! I just want some answers.
dialog: 
dialog: LYLESBURG: You weren't meant to see this.
dialog: 
dialog: LORI: I kind of got that impression.
dialog: 
dialog: LYLESBURG: Then you also understand that to speak of this to anyone
dialog: will bring dire consequences . . .
dialog: 
dialog: LORI: Hey, pal, don't threaten me.
dialog: 
dialog: LYLESBURG: Not for you. For us.
dialog: 
text: His words take the edge off Lori's anger. She notices that inscribed

text: 'WHAT'S BELOW REMAINS BELOW'
dialog: 
scene_heading: LYLESBURG [cont.]: What's below remains below. This is the Law.

dialog: 
dialog: LORI: Wait! Wait a minute! Boone, Aaron Boone, just tell me, is he

dialog: way off.
dialog: 
dialog: LORI [to herself]: How deep does this go?
dialog: 
text: She heads on down, turning a corner. In front of her, Peloquin. He

dialog: DECKER: Let's get it over with, shall we?

dialog: For pleasure. Everyone ought to have a hobby, don't you agree?

dialog: 
dialog: MAN: Watch the pretty light.
dialog: 
text: It moves up towards Lylesburg's face, until it's centred on his
text: forehead. The man fires, killing his victim. Lylesburg falls, hanging
text: from the door by the key chain around his neck. His many eyes have
text: opened. The man grins. Then hears a noise behind him. He turns to see
text: the Ferreol Vees, creatures like Manta Rays that glide through the
text: air, appearing around the corner. They swoop towards him, separating.
text: The middle one opens its mouth as it strikes his face. He is
text: eclipsed. When the Vees pass on down the corridor, the man's face is
text: a bloody wreck. He falls to the floor, just out of reach
text: of the Berserkers, who roar their frustration.

text: key in the lock. The door opens. A rush of filthy wind emerges from
text: the chamber beyond. Then the Berserkers appear: lethal brutes, all
text: teeth, armour and muscle. One of them, Ghost, takes hold of Boone,
text: and there's a beat when it seems certain to dispatch him.
dialog: 
text: Then a burst of light from Baphomet's chamber spills over them, and
text: there's a roar from their unseen God. They let Boone go, and they're

dialog: 
text: Tommy leads a line of five posse members who have cornered a number
text: of wounded Breed against one of the walls. One of the
text: creatures attempts to scramble away. Tommy guns him down. He turns
text: to the other gunmen.
dialog: 
dialog: TOMMY: Watch this!
dialog: 
text: The two posse members prepare to kill the Breed. The ground around
text: them begins to shudder, and a fist bursts out of the ground and grabs
text: the leg of a posse member and drags him down.
dialog: 
text: Another fist then bursts out of the ground.
dialog: 
text: Then in silhouette the Berserkers climb out of the earth beside the
text: posse. Two of the posse turn, and fire at the Berserkers, who advance
text: through the hail of the bullets, and quickly dispatch the two gunmen.
text: Tommy has begun to fire at the feet of the cornered Breed, obliging
dialog: them to dance.
dialog: 
dialog: TOMMY [laughs]: Dance, fuckers!
dialog: 
text: The display gets appreciative hoots and laughter from the three
text: surviving posse members, who - like Tommy - are as yet unaware that
text: the Berserkers are advancing on them. Tommy continues to fire at the
text: ground around the Breed, as one by one his three companions are
text: dispatched by the Berserkers. We close in on Tommy, whose face is
text: suddenly spattered with blood. He stops firing. He looks round to
text: find himself surrounded by Berserkers. The shadows fall over him.
text: Their hands take hold of him.
dialog: 
text: We see the shadow of what they do to him on the walls: his body is
text: torn apart.
dialog: 
text: We cut to the Berserkers. Ghost has Tommy's gun, with the hand still
text: attached. He tosses it aside, roaring like King Kong. The wounded
text: Breed hurry away as the Berserkers head off in search of
dialog: new mischief.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 237. EXT. NECROPOLIS NEAR THE GATES NIGHT
dialog: 
text: With the tide turning inside the Necropolis, a disorganized retreat
text: is underway. Eigerman is at the gate watching the remains of his
text: 'army' staggering away. Joyce is watching the scene.
dialog: 
dialog: EIGERMAN: Stand your ground! Stand your ground! They've got to come
dialog: this way. We can mow 'em down.
dialog: 
text: He climbs up on a vehicle which is parked at the gates. In the
text: driving seat is Gibbs. Beside him, a woman, her face smoke-stained,
text: her expression near catatonic.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EIGERMAN: Gibbs?
dialog: 
dialog: GIBBS: Sir?
dialog: 
dialog: EIGERMAN: Lights!
dialog: 
text: Gibbs switches the lights on, to pierce the smoke. Bad move. The
text: illumination shows the Berserkers appearing. They approach the
dialog: vehicle.
dialog: 
dialog: EIGERMAN: Shit!
dialog: 
text: Eigerman jumps from the vehicle, as the retreating posse fire at the
text: Berserkers. It's a useless response. Bloodied but unbowed, the
text: Berserkers run at the vehicles. The woman throws herself out, but
text: Gibbs isn't quick enough. One of the Berserkers pushes the vehicle up
text: the wall of the Necropolis, and Blatz, a small, vicious creature,
text: stamps on the roof. Inside, Gibbs cowers as the roof is beaten in. He
text: is crushed.
dialog: 
text: Joyce, who has been watching this entire scene, moves away from the
text: gate towards the Necropolis. The fires are dying down
text: somewhat, and an eerie half-light bathes the scene he moves through.
text: A few surviving posse hurry away, firing at every movement in the
dialog: shadows.
dialog: 
text: Back at the gate we see one of the escaping Berserkers flip another
text: car over, while his brothers dispatch posse members. The survivors

dialog: 
dialog: PELOQUIN: Yes, it's him.
dialog: 
text: Boone squatting in front of his fire of love letters. Boone dead in
text: the reeds.
dialog: 
dialog: PELOQUIN: All these years waiting for a saviour. But he hasn't saved
dialog: us. He's destroyed us. I made him, and he's destroyed us.
dialog: 
dialog: LORI: Made him?
dialog: 
text: PELOQUIN: The bite was mine. The bite that mocks death.
dialog: 
dialog: LORI: That doesn't make him yours. I belong here on this wall, just

dialog: 
dialog: DECKER: Quite a dance, huh? Death everywhere and you and me in the

dialog: 
text: He throws the head of a Breed at Boone.
dialog: 
dialog: DECKER: Even the dead can die!

dialog: 
dialog: DECKER: Almost!
dialog: 
text: Boone falls back. Decker closes on him, the knives at his neck. The
text: force of his stabs, which miss Boone's neck, break the boards of the
text: bridge. Boone braces his feet beneath Decker and tosses him over.
text: Decker gets up and approaches him again, slashing the ropes of the
text: bridge with his blades as he comes. The fighters connect and
text: struggle, their violent motion carrying them over the edge of the
text: bridge, dropping them down another level. Decker lands very heavily,
text: and lies still. Boone gets up. His exit along the bridge in one
text: direction is blocked. He has to step past Decker who doesn't
text: move. Only when Boone has stepped beyond him does Decker get up,
text: pursuing Boone across the bridge, and flinging one of the
text: knives at his victim's back. The blade cuts straight through Boone,
text: sticking out from his chest a good six inches. He turns, his fury
text: transforming him into a more extreme creature. Decker comes at Boone
text: with a second blade, slashing at Boone's neck. The battle carries
text: them off the bridge onto the stairs. Decker takes hold of Boone's
text: hair, preparing to deliver the coup de grace. Boone reaches for a
text: weapon, finds a skull, and smashes it into the mask. Decker lets go.
text: Boone tumbles off the stairs, falling face down on a card table.
dialog: 
text: Decker follows down the stairs. Boone pulls the table off his chest,
text: leaving the Ace of Hearts on the blade in his chest. Decker follows
text: through, driving Boone back into one of the Breed's rooms, where the
text: fight continues. Decker takes a whip from the wall and uses it to
text: disarm Boone, who has snatched up a bone to defend himself with.
text: Boone snatches up a second bone and retaliates, delivering blow after
text: blow against Decker, eventually knocking the knife from his hand and
text: driving him out on to the ledge once more. Decker teeters on the
text: edge, now defenceless. Boone approaches.
dialog: 
dialog: BOONE: Want to dance?
dialog: 
text: He snatches the mask off Decker's face and draws him close, impaling
text: Decker on his own blade. Decker screams.
dialog: 
text: Then Boone pushes him off the blade, and over the edge of the ledge.
text: Decker falls.
dialog:

scene_heading: 246. INT. BAPHOMET'S CHAMBER
dialog:

text: Nightbreed, surviving members of a Senior Council, Rachel among them,
text: standing around Baphomet. They are wrapping severed limbs of
text: Baphomet, preparing to include him in the exodus. His head and
text: shoulders remain suspended in the light. Baphomet's lips move, making
text: a terrible, eloquent sound. Rachel translates, the deep voice we hear
text: coming from her lips.
dialog: 
scene_heading: RACHEL/BAPHOMET: Come closer...
dialog: 
text: Boone obeys. Baphomet's remaining arm reaches down and holds Boone,

dialog: 
dialog: RACHEL/BAPHOMET: ...You have destroyed our refuge...
dialog: 
dialog: BOONE: I never meant...
dialog: 
text: Baphomet silences him. Boone trembles but maintains eye contact.
