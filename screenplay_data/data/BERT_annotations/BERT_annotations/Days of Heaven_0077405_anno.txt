text: "Troops of nomads swept over the country at harvest time like a visitation of locusts, reckless young fellows, handsome, profane, licentious, given to drink, powerful but inconstant workmen, quarrelsome and difficult to manage at all times. They came in the season when work was plenty and wages high. They dressed well, in their own peculiar fashion, and made much of their freedom to come and go."
text: "They told of the city, and sinister and poisonous jungles all cities seemed in their stories. They were scarred with battles. They came from the far-away and unknown, and passed on to the north, mysterious as the flight of locusts, leaving the people of Sun Prairie quite as ignorant of their real names and characters as upon the first day of their coming."						Hamlin Garland, Boy Life on the Prairie (1899)
speaker_heading: DAYS OF HEAVEN
scene_heading: 1	INT. CHICAGO MILL - SERIES OF ANGLES
text: WORKERS in a dark Chicago mill pound molten iron out in flaming sheets. The year is 1916.
speaker_heading: 2	EXT. MILL
dialog: BILL, a handsome young man from the slums, and his brother
dialog: STEVE sit outside on their lunch break talking with an
dialog: older man named BLACKIE. By the look of his flashy clothes
dialog: Blackie is not a worker.
speaker_heading: BLACKIE
dialog: Listen, if I ever seen a tit, this here's a tit. You understand? Candy. My kid sister could do this one. Pure fucking candy'd melt in your hand. Don't take brains. Just a set of rocks. I told you this already.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Blackie, you told me it was going to snow in the winter, I'd go out and bet against it. You know?
dialog: (to Bill)
dialog: There is nothing, nothing in the world, dumber than a dumb guinea.
speaker_heading: BLACKIE
dialog: Okay, all right, fine. Why should I be doing favors for a guy that isn't doing me any favors? I must be losing my grip.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I got to give it to you, though. Couple of guys look like you just rolled in on a wagonload of chickens. You ever get laid?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: BLACKIE
dialog: Without a lot of talk, I mean? 'Cause I'm beginning to understand these guys, go down the hotel, pick something up for a couple of bucks. It's clean, and you know what you're in for.
speaker_heading: 3	EXT. ALLEY
text: Sam the Collector's GANG swaggers around in the alley behind a textile plant. ONE of them has filed his teeth down to points and stuck diamonds in between them. ANOTHER wears big suspenders.
dialog: Sam and Bill appear to know one another.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Hey, Billy, you made a mistake. You made somebody mad. Nothing personal, okay? It's just gotta be done. You made a mistake. Happens in the best of families.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I paid you everything I have. Search me. The rest he gets next week.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Listen, what happens if I don't do this? I gotta leave town?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I could do something, you know. You guys wanta do something to me, I know who to tell about it. You guys ought to think about that.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You maybe already did something. Maybe that's why you're here, on account of you already done something.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I haven't done anything.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Then you're all right, Billy.
speaker_heading: RAZOR TEETH
dialog: You got nothing to worry about.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Cut it out, Billy, all right? You know what can happen to a guy that doesn't wanta do what people tell him? You know. So don't give us a lot of trouble. You're liable to get everybody all pissed off.
text: Sam, a busy man, checks his watch.
speaker_heading: 4	NEW ANGLE
text: Bill puts his hand on the ground. Sam drops a keg of roofing nails on it and, his work done, leaves with his gang. Bill sobs with pain.
speaker_heading: 5	EXT. LOT BEYOND MILL
text: Bill and Steve drag a safe by a rope through a vacant lot beyond the mill. Blackie walks behind.
speaker_heading: BLACKIE
text: You know what I'm doing with my end? Buy a boat. Get that? I had a boat. I had a nice apartment, I had a boat. Margie don't like that. We got to have a house. "I can't afford no house," I said. She says, "Sell the boat." I didn't want to sell my boat. I didn't want to buy the house. I sell the boat, I buy the house. Nine years we had the house, eight of them she's after me, we should get another boat. I give up.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Same as always, I do all the work, you gripe about it.
text: Suddenly FOUR POLICEMEN surprise them from ambush. Bill lets go of the rope and starts to run. Steve does not give up immediately, however, and they shoot him down. Bill picks up Steve's gun and fires back. Three of the Policemen go chasing after Blackie, whom they soon bring to heel. The FOURTH stays behind taking potshots at Bill while he attends to Steve.
speaker_heading: 6	TIGHT ON STEVE
text: Steve, badly wounded, is about to die.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Run. Get out of here.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (weeping)
dialog: I love you so much. Why didn't you run. Don't die.
text: Steve dies. Bullets kick up dust around him. He takes off running. One of the bullets has caught him in the shoulder.
speaker_heading: 7	INT. SEWER
text: ABBY, a beautiful woman in her late twenties, attends to Bill's wounds in a big vaulted sewer. Her sister URSULA, a reckless girl of14, stands watch.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (weeping)
dialog: They shot the shit out of him. My brother. I couldn't believe what I was seeing.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Hold still, or I can't do anything.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I love you, Abby. You're so good to me. Remember how much fun we had, on the roof...
speaker_heading: 8	EXT. ROOF - MATTE SHOT
text: Bill and Abby flirt on the root of a tenement, happily in love. The city stretches out behind them.
speaker_heading: 9	INT. BED - QUICK CUT
text: Abby lies shivering with fever. Bill spoons hot soup into her mouth. Ursula rolls paper flowers for extra change.
speaker_heading: BILL (o.s.)
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: ... even when you were sick and I was in the mill.
scene_heading: 10	INT. MILL - QUICK CUT (VARIOUS ANGLES OF OTHER WORKERS)
text: Bill works in the glow of a blast furnace. He does not seem quite in place with the rest of the workers. A pencil moustache lends a desired gentlemanliness to his appearance. He looks fallen on hard times, without ever having known any better--like Chaplin, an immigrant lost in the heartless city, with dim hopes for a better way of life.
speaker_heading: BILL (o.s.)
dialog: I won't let you go back in the mill. People die in there. I'm a man, and I can look out for you.
speaker_heading: 11	EXT. SIDING OUTSIDE MILL
text: Along a railroad spur outside the mill, Abby and Ursula glean bits of coal that have fallen from the tenders.
speaker_heading: BILL (o.s.)
dialog: We're going west. Things gotta be better out there.
speaker_heading: 12	EXT. TENEMENT
text: A POLICEMAN, looking for Bill, roughs Abby up behind the tenement where they live. Suddenly Bill runs out from a doorway and slams him over the head with a clay pitcher full of water.
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: What'd you do?
text: Bill shrugs, then hits him again, knocking him unconscious, when he reaches for a gun. Abby calls Ursula and they take off running, Bill stopping only to collect some of their laundry off a clothesline.
speaker_heading: 13	EXT. FREIGHT YARDS
dialog: They hop a freight train.
speaker_heading: 14	CREDITS (OVER EXISTING PHOTOS)
text: The CREDITS run over black and white photos of the Chicago they are leaving behind. Pigs roam the gutters. Street urchins smoke cigar butts under a stairway. A blind man hawks stale bread. Dirty children play around a dripping hydrant. Laundry hangs out to dry on tenement fire escapes. Police look for a thief under a bridge. Irish gangs stare at the camera, curious how they will look. The CREDITS end.
speaker_heading: 15	EXT. MOVING TRAIN
text: Abby and Bill sit atop a train racing through the wheat country of the Texas Panhandle.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I like the sunshine.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Everybody does.
text: They laugh. She is dressed in men's clothes, her hair tucked up under a cap. They are sharing a bottle of wine.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I never wanted to fall in love with you.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Nobody asked you to.
text: He draws her toward him. She pulls away.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: What's the matter? A while ago you said I was irresistible. I still am.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: That was then.
text: She pushes her nose up against his chest and sniffs around.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: You playing mousie again?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: I love how nice and hard your shoulders are. And your hair is light. You're not a soft, greasy guy that puts bay rum on every night.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I love it when you've been drinking.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: You're not greasy, Bill. You have any idea what that means?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Kind of.
text: They share the boxcar with a crowd of other HARVEST HANDS. Ursula is among them, also dressed like a man. Bill gestures out at the landscape.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Look at all that space. Oweee! We should've done this a long time ago. It's just us and the road now, Abby.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: We're all still together, though. That's all I care about.
speaker_heading: 16	EXT. JERKWATER
text: The train slows down to take on water. The hands jump off. Each carries his "bindle"-- a blanket and a few personal effects wrapped in canvas. TOUGHS with ax handles are on hand to greet them.
text: The harvesters speak a Babel of tongues, from German to Uzbek to Swedish. Only English is rare. Some retain odd bits of their national costumes, they are pathetic figures, lonely and dignified and so far from home. Others, in split shoes and sockless feet, are tramps. Most are honest workers, though, here to escape the summer heat in the factories of the East. They dress inappropriately for farm work, in the latest fashions.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Elbow room! Oweee! Give me a chance and I'm going to dance!
text: Bill struts around with a Napoleonic air, in a white Panama hat and gaiters, taking in the vista. Under his arm he carries a sword cane with a pearl handle. It pleases him, in this small way, to set himself apart from the rest of toiling humanity. He wants it known that he was born to greater things.
speaker_heading: 17	NEW ANGLE
text: Bill comes upon a BIG MAN whose face is covered with blood.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Good, very good. Where you from, mister?
speaker_heading: BIG MAN
dialog: Cleveland.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Like to see the other guy.
text: Bill helps him to his feet and dusts him off. A TOUGH walks up.
speaker_heading: TOUGH
dialog: You doing this shit?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Then keep it moving.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Oh yeah? Who're you?
text: The Tough hits Bill across the head with his ax handle.
speaker_heading: TOUGH
dialog: Name is Morrison.
text: Bill looks around to see whether Abby has seen this. She hasn't. He walks dizzily off down the tracks.
speaker_heading: 18	NEW ANGLE
dialog: He takes Abby by the arm.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: What happened to your ear?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Nothing.
text: She is a sultry beauty--emancipated, full of bright hopes and a zest for life. Her costume does not fool the men. Wherever she goes they ogle her insolently.
speaker_heading: EXT. WAGONS
text: The FOREMEN of the surrounding farms wait by their wagons to carry the workers off. A flag pole is planted by each wagon. Those who do not speak English negotiate their wages on a blackboard.
text: BENSON, a leathery man of fifty, bellows through a megaphone. In the background a NEWCOMER to the harvest talks with a VETERAN.
speaker_heading: BENSON
dialog: Shockers! Four more and I'm leaving.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: How much you paying?
speaker_heading: BENSON
dialog: Man can make three dollars a day, he wants to work.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Who're you kidding?
dialog: Bill mills around. They have no choice but to accept his offer.
speaker_heading: BENSON
dialog: Sackers!
text: Abby steps up. Benson takes her for a young man.
speaker_heading: BENSON
dialog: You ever sacked before?
dialog: She nods.
text: Transcriber's Note: the following seven lines of dialogue between the NEWCOMER and the VETERAN runs concurrent with the previous six lines of dialogue between Benson and Bill and Abby. In the original script they are typed in two columns running side-by-side down the page.
dialog: *****
speaker_heading: NEWCOMER (o.s.)
dialog: How's the pussy up there?
speaker_heading: VETERAN
dialog: Not good. Where you from?
speaker_heading: NEWCOMER (o.s.)
dialog: Detroit.
speaker_heading: VETERAN
dialog: How's the pussy up there?
speaker_heading: NEWCOMER (o.s.)
dialog: Good.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: The guys tough out here?
speaker_heading: VETERAN (o.s.)
dialog: Not so tough. How about up there?
speaker_heading: NEWCOMER (o.s.)
dialog: Tough.
dialog: *****
speaker_heading: BENSON
dialog: When's that?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Last year.
text: He waves her on. Abby nods at Ursula.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: You're making a mistake, you pass this kid up.
speaker_heading: BENSON
dialog: Get on.
text: He snaps his fingers at her. Bill climbs up ahead of the women. Anger makes him extremely polite.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: You don't need to say it like that.
dialog: Benson ignores this remark but dislikes Bill from the first.
speaker_heading: 20	EXT. PLAINS
text: Benson's wagons roll across the plains toward the Razumihin, a "bonanza" or wheat ranch of spectacular dimensions, its name spelled out in whitewashed rocks on the side of a hill.
speaker_heading: 21	EXT. BONANZA GATES (NEAR SIGN)
text: The wagons pass under a large arch, set in the middle of nowhere, like the gates to a vanished kingdom. Goats peer down from on top.
text: Bill looks at Abby and raises his eyebrows.
speaker_heading: 22	EXT. BELVEDERE
text: At the center of the bonanza, amid a tawny sea of grain, stands a gay Victorian house, three stories tall. Where most farm houses stand more sensibly on low ground, protected from the elements, "The Belvedere" occupies the highest ridge around, commanding the view and esteem of all.
text: Filigrees of gingerbread adorn the eaves. Cottonwood saplings, six feet high, have recently been planted in the front. Peacocks fuss about the yard. There is a lawn swing and a flagpole, used like a ship's mast for signaling distant parts of the bonanza. A wind generator supplies electric power.
text: A white picket fence surrounds the house, though its purpose is unclear; where the prairie leaves off and the yard begins is impossible to tell.
text: Bison drift over the hills like boats on the ocean. Bill shouts at the nearest one.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Yo, Beevo!
speaker_heading: 23	TIGHT ON CHUCK
text: CHUCK ARTUNOV, the owner--a man of great reserve and dignity, still a bachelor--stands on the front porch of the Belvedere high above, observing the new arrivals.
speaker_heading: 24	EXT. DORMITORY
text: Benson drops the hands off at the dormitory, a hundred yards below, a plain clapboard building with a ceiling of exposed joists. Ursula sees Chuck watching them.
speaker_heading: URSULA
dialog: Whose place is that?
speaker_heading: BENSON
dialog: The owner's. Don't none of you go up around his place. First one that does is fired. I'm warning you right now.
text: In the warm July weather most of the hands forsake the dorm to spread their bedrolls around a strawpile or in the hayloft of the nearby barn.
text: Abby and Bill slip off to share a cigarette. Ursula tags behind.
speaker_heading: 25	EXT. ROCK
text: Bill lifts a big rock. Abby applauds. Ursula kneels down behind
text: him. Abby pushes him over backwards.
speaker_heading: 26	EXT. BARN
text: Ursula gasps as Abby tumbles off the roof of the barn and falls through the air screaming:
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Urs!
dialog: She lands in a straw pile.
speaker_heading: 27	TIGHT ON ABBY AND BILL
text: Bill takes Abby by the hands, spins her around until she is thoroughly dizzy, then grasps her across the chest.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Ready?
text: She giggles her consent. He crushes her in a bear hug until she is just on the verge of passing out, then lets her go. She sinks to the grass, in a daze of sweet intoxication.
speaker_heading: 28	EXT. LANTERN - NIGHT
text: Bill looks deeply into Abby's eyes by the light of a lantern that night. They have made a shallow cut on their thumbs and press them together mixing their blood like children.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: You're all I've got, Abby. No, really, everything I ever had is a complete piece of garbage except you.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: I know.
text: They laugh. He bends to kiss her. She pulls away.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Sometimes I think you don't like men.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: As individuals? Very seldom.
text: She kisses him lovingly.
speaker_heading: 29	EXT. WHEAT FIELDS - DAWN
text: The sun peers over the horizon. The wheat makes a sound like a waterfall. It stretches for as far as the eye can see. A PREACHER has come out, in a cassock and surplice, to offer prayers of thanksgiving.
speaker_heading: PREACHER
dialog: "... that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which the Lord swore unto your fathers to give them, as the days of' heaven upon the earth."
text: The harvesters spit and rub their hands as they wait for the dew to burn off. They have slept in their coats. The dawn has a raw edge, even in summer.
speaker_heading: 30	TIGHT ON WHEAT
text: Chuck looks to see if the wheat is ready to harvest. He shakes the heads; they make a sound like paper. He snaps off a handful, rolls them between his palms, blows away the chaff and pinches the kernels that remain to make sure they have grown properly hard.
dialog: Tiny sounds are magnified in the early morning stillness:
text: grasshoppers snapping through the air, a cough, a distant hawk.
text: He pops the kernels into his mouth, chews them up, and rolls the wad around in his mouth. Satisfied, he spits it out and gives a nod. The Preacher begins a prayer of thanksgiving. Two ACOLYTES flank him, one with a smoking censer, the other with a crucifix.
text: All repeat the "Amen." Benson makes a tugging signal with his arm. A Case tractor--forty tons of iron, steam-driven, as big and as powerful as a locomotive--blasts its whistle. This is the moment they have been waiting all year for.
speaker_heading: 31	OTHER FIELDS - SERIES OF ANGLES
text: A SIGNALMAN with two hand flags passes the message on from the crest of a nearby hill. In the far-flung fields of the bonanza other tractors answer as other crews set to work.
text: Abby and Bill join in, Bill reaping the wheat with a mowing machine called a binder, Abby propping the bound sheaves together to make bunches or "shocks."
text: A cloud of chaff rises over the field, melting the sun down to a cold red bulb.
text: Abby is well turned out, in a boater and string tie, as though she were planning any moment to leave for a picnic.
text: Bill, too, dresses with an eye to flashy fashion: Tight dark trousers, a silk handkerchief stuck in the back pocket with a copy of the Police Gazette, low-top calfskin boots with high heels and pointed toes, a shirt with ruffled cuffs, and a big signet ring. While at work he wears a white smock over all this to keep the chaff off. It gives him the air more of a researcher than a worker.
text: The harvesters itch madly as the chaff gets into their clothes. The shocks, full of briars, cut their hands; smut and rust make the cuts sting like fire. Nobody talks. From time to time they raise a chant.
text: Ursula, plucking chickens by the cookhouse--a shack on wheels-- steals a key chain from an unwatched coat.
text: Benson follows the reapers around the field in a buggy. He keeps their hours, chides loafers, checks the horses, etc. The harvesters are city people. Few of them are trained to farming. Most--Abby and Bill are no exception--have contempt for it and anybody dull enough to practice it. Tight control is therefore exercised to see that the machines are not damaged.
text: Where the others loaf whenever Benson's back is turned, Bill works like a demon, as a point of pride.
speaker_heading: 32	CHUCK AND BENSON
text: Lightning shivers through the clouds along the horizon. Chuck looks concerned. Benson consults a windsock.
speaker_heading: BENSON
dialog: Should miss us.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: They must be having trouble over there, though.
text: Abby, passing by, lifts her hat to wipe her face. As she does her hair falls out of the crown. Women are rare in the harvest fields. One so beautiful is unprecedented.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: I didn't know we had any women on.
speaker_heading: BENSON
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: I thought she was a boy. Should I get rid of her?
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: 33	MONTAGE
text: A COOK stands on the horizon waving a white flag at the end of a fishing pole. Ursula bounds through the wheat blowing a horn.
text: Benson consults the large clock strapped to the back of his buggy, then fires a smoke pistol in the air.
text: Their faces black with chaff, the hands fall out in silence. They shuffle across the field toward the cookhouse, keeping their feet close to the ground to avoid being spiked by the stubble.
scene_heading: 34	EXT. COOKHOUSE - STUBBLE FIELD IN B.G.
text: The COOKS, Orientals in homburgs, serve from planks thrown across sawhorses. The hands cuff and push each other around as they wash up. The water, brought up fresh in wagons from the wells, makes them gasp. An ice wagon and a fire truck are parked nearby.
text: Most sit on the ground to eat, under awnings or beach umbrellas dotted around the field like toadstools. The Belvedere is visible miles away on the horizon.
text: Bill is carrying Abby's lunch to her when a loutish DUTCH MAN makes a crack.
speaker_heading: DUTCHMAN
dialog: Your sister keep you warm at night?
text: Bill throws a plate of stew at him and they are quickly in a fight. No fists are used, just food. The others pull them apart. Bill storms away, flicking mashed potatoes off his shirt.
scene_heading: 35	EXT. GRAIN WAGON - STUBBLE FIELD IN B.G.
text: Bill and Abby sit by themselves in the shade of a grain wagon. Demoralized, Abby soaks her hands in a pail of bran water. Bill inspects them anxiously. They are swollen and cracked from the morning's work.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: I ran a stubble under my nail.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Didn't you ever learn how to take care of yourself? I told you to keep the gloves on. What can I do if you don't listen?
text: Bill presses her wrists against his cheek, ashamed that he can do nothing to shield her from such indignities. In the b.g. a MAN with a fungo bat hits flies to SOME MEN with baseball gloves.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: You can't keep on like this.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: What else can we do?
dialog: She nods at the others.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Anyway, if they can, I can too.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: That bunch? Don't compare yourself to them.
text: She flexes her fingers. They seem lame.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: You drop off this weak. I can make enough for us both. It was a crime to bring you out here. Somebody like you.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Right now, what I'm doing, I'm just dragging you down.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Maybe you should go back to Chicago. We've got enough for a ticket, and I can send you what I make.
text: He seems a little surprised when she does not reject this idea out of hand. Perhaps he fears that if she ever did go back, he might never see her again.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: What's the matter?
text: She begins to cry. He takes her in his arms.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I know how you feel, honey. Things won't always be this way. I promise.
speaker_heading: 36	ABBY AND BILL - CHUCK'S POV
text: The men knock out their pipes as Benson's whistle summons them back to their stations.
speaker_heading: BENSON
dialog: Tick tockl Tick tock! Nothing moving but the clock!
text: Bill pulls Abby to her feet. He sees the Dutchman he fought with and shoots him the finger.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: You better be careful.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Of him? He's just a. sack of shit.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Stop it! He's liable to see you.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I want him to. He's the one better be careful.
speaker_heading: 37	TIGHT ON CHUCK
text: Chuck looks on. Something about her captivates hint, not so much her beauty--which only makes her seem beyond his reach--as the way she takes it utterly for granted.
speaker_heading: 38	MONTAGE (DISSOLVES)
text: The work goes on through the afternoon. The pace is stern and incessant, and for a reason: a storm could rise at any moment and sweep the crops flat, or a dry wind shrivel them up. A series of dissolves gives the sense of many days passing.
text: Iany moment and sweep the crops flat, or a dry wind shrivel them up.Animals--snakes and gophers, rabbits and foxes--dart through the field into the deep of the wheat, not realizing their sanctuary is growing ever smaller as the reapers make their rounds. The moment will come when they will every one be killed with rakes and flails.
text: The wheat changes colors in the wind, like velvet. As the sun drops toward the horizon a dew sets, making the straw hard to cut. Benson fires his pistol. A vine of smoke sinks lazily through the sky. As the workers move off, the fields grow vast and inhospitable.
dialog: Oil wells can be seen here and there amid the grain.
speaker_heading: 39	EXT. ABBY'S ROW
text: Bill helps Abby finish up a row. Thousands of shocks stretch out in the distance. Benson comes up behind her, making a spray of the stalks that she missed.
speaker_heading: BENSON
dialog: You must've passed over a dozen bushels here. I'm docking you three dollars.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: What're you talking about? That's not fair.
speaker_heading: BENSON
dialog: Then leave. You're fired.
text: Abby is speechless. Bill squeezes the small rubber ball which he carries around to improve his grip and swallows his pride.
speaker_heading: BILL
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Wait a minute.
speaker_heading: BENSON
dialog: You want to stay?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Then shut up and get back to work.
dialog: Benson leaves. Abby covers Bill's embarrassment.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I guess he meant it.
text: She turns her back to him and goes about picking up the sheaf Benson threw down.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: He did. Ask him. If you can't sing or dance, what do you do in this world? You might as well forget it.
dialog: Ising or dance, what do you do this world? You might as wellu
dialog: rorget it.
speaker_heading: 40	EXT. STOCK POND - DUSK
dialog: Their day's work done, the men swim naked in a stock pond.
dialog: Their faces are black, their bodies white as a baby's.
text: A retriever plunges through the water fetching sticks.
speaker_heading: 41	EXT. ROAD - DUSK
text: Some bowl with their hats on in a dusty road and argue in Italian.
scene_heading: 42	EXT. BELVEDERE - DOCTOR'S WAGON - DUSK
text: A physician's wagon stands in front of the Belvedere.
dialog: Bill hunts nervously through it for medicine to soothe Abby's
dialog: hands. Not knowing quite what to look for, he sniffs whatever
dialog: catches his eye.
text: Suddenly the front door opens and Chuck steps out with a DOCTOR, a stooped old man in a black frock coat. Bill, surprised, crouches behind the wheel. As they draw closer their conversation becomes faintly audible.
speaker_heading: CHUCK (o.s.)
dialog: How long you give it?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR (o.s.)
dialog: Could be next month. Could be a year. Hard to say. Anyway, I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: CHUCK (o.s.)
dialog: Got to happen sometime.
dialog: They shake hands

speaker_heading: 54	EXT. SEPARATOR - SERIES OF ANGLESI
text: Sixty foot belts connect the tractors to the separating machines, huge rattletrap devices that shell the wheat out at deafening volume. Benson tosses bundles down the hissing maw, squirts oil into the gears, tightens belts, chews out a MAN who's sliced a hand on the driveshaft, etc.
text: Bill works on the straw pile at the back of the machine, in a soft rain of chaff, spreading it out with a pitchfork.

dialog: the mill. Couldn't wait to get in there. Begin at seven, got to have a smile on your face. Didn't work out, though. No matter what you do, sometimes
dialog: things just don't go right. It gets to you after a while. It gives you that feeling, "Oh hell, what's the use?"
dialog: (pause)
dialog: My dad told me, forget what the people around you are doing. You got enough to worry about without considering what somebody else does. Otherwise you get fouled up. He used to say (tapping his temple)
text: "All you got is this." Only one day you wake up, find you're not the smartest guy in the world, never going to come up with the big score. I really believed when I was growing up that somehow I would. I worked like a bastard in that mill. I felt all right about it, though. I felt that somewhere along the line somebody would see I had that special gleam. "Hey, you, come over here." So then I'd go.
dialog: They are silent for a moment.

speaker_heading: URSULA
dialog: I heard you farmers were big and dumb. You aren't so big. Where do they learn how to?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: They're so darling! Can you eat them?

speaker_heading: 92	EXT. POST
text: They pitch rocks at a post and exchange intimacies. Abby has grown more lively.
speaker_heading: ABBY

dialog: Are you in love with me, Chuck, or why are you always so nervous?
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: (Stumbling)
dialog: Maybe I am. I must be.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Why? On account of something I've done?
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Because you're so beautiful.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: What a nice thing to say. Look, I hit it. Did you see?

dialog: Jupiter, the Crab Nebula, the canals of Mars, etc.

speaker_heading: 96	EXT. RIDGE - DAWN
text: They are on a ridge opposite the Belvedere looking at the heavens through Chuck's telescope. Abby tingles with a sense of wonder. Chuck has opened a whole new world to her.

dialog: her some of this stuff?
speaker_heading: 97	EXT. FATHER'S GRAVE - NIGHT

speaker_heading: 101	EXT. PLOWED FIELD - FLASHBACK
text: A plow folds back the earth. The roots of the prairie grass twang like harp strings.
text: The plowing done, his father sows the seed. Poverty requires that for a harrow he drag a tree branch in back of his ox. Over his shoulder he carries a rifle.

text: A scarecrow is rigged to his back, to make him more intimidating.
speaker_heading: 102	CHUCK AND FATHER - FLASHBACK

speaker_heading: 107	PAN OVER HILLS-DAWN
text: The camera pans across Chuck's vast domain.
speaker_heading: CHUCK (o.s.)
dialog: I gave my life to that land.
dialog: But what do I really have now? It'll still be here when I'm gone. It won't remember me.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I'd give it all up for you. I could make you happy, too, I think-if only you'd trust me.
text: The camera settles on Ursula, playing with a dog on a seesaw Chuck

text: Abby on the ridge by the telescope. Chuck is proposing.
speaker_heading: 108	EXT. DORM
dialog: Abby has told him of the proposal. Bill broods over an unlit cigarette. Is this a great blessing or a great misfortune which has befallen them?
speaker_heading: ABBY

speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I never really thought he would.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: I thought you wanted me to.
speaker_heading: BILL

speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: What're you thinking?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: We've never done anything like this.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Who'd know but you and me?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Nobody.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: That's it, Ab. That's all that matters, isn't it?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: You talk like it was all right. It would be a crime.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: But to give him what he wants more than anything? Two, threeI
dialog: months of sunshine? He'll never get to enjoy his money anyway.
dialog: What're you talking about? We'd be showing him the first good
dialog: times of his life.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Maybe you're right.
text: At each hint of consent from Abby, Bill feels he must press on.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: You know what they're going to stick on his tombstone? "Born
dialog: like a fool, worked like a mule." Two lines.
dialog: Abby cannot say the proposal is devoid of principle. The idea of easing Chuck's imminent death gives them just the shade of a good motive. This would be a trade.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: What makes you think we're just talking about a couple of months?U
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Listen, the man's got one foot on a banana peel and the other
dialog: on a roller skate. What can I say? We'll be gone before theI

speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: I held out a long time. I could've taken the first guy with a gold watch, but I held out.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I told myself that when I found somebody, I'd stick by him.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I know. We're in quicksand, though. We stand around, it's
dialog: going to suck us down like everybody else.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Somewhere along the line you have to make a sacrifice. Lots of people want to sit back and take a piece without doing nothing.
text: He waits to see how she will respond. Half of him wants her to turn him down flat. Abby is bewildered.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Have I ever complained? Have I said anything that would make
dialog: you think...
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: You don't have to. I hate it when I see you stooped over and
dialog: them looking at your ass like you were a whore. I personally
dialog: feel ashamed! I want to take a .45 and let somebody have it.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: We got to look on the bright side of this, Ab. Year from

dialog: Some people need more'n they have, some have more'n they need. It's

Ursula bounces around in a beautiful gown, looking for the first time like a young woman. The BAND practically outnumbers the guests: ELDERS from the local Mennonites, the MAYORS of a few surrounding towns decked out in sashes and medals, etc.
speaker_heading: 112	TIGHT ON ABBY AND BILL
text: Bill kisses the bride on the cheek. Each believes she is going through with this for the other's sake. They whisper back and forth.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: You know what this means, don't you?
dialog: (he nods)
dialog: We won't ever let each other down, will we?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I love you more than ever. I always will. I couldn't do this unless I loved you.
speaker_heading: 113	SERIES OF ANGLES

dialog: They smile at each other.
speaker_heading: 116	EXT. BELVEDERE - DUSKI
text: Bill watches the lights go out in the Belvedere. A lump rises to his throat. How exactly did this happen? He sets his jaw, vowing not to give way to weakness or jealousy. This is the price they have to pay for a lasting

speaker_heading: 117	TIGHT ON ABBY, CHUCK, ETC.
dialog: The next morning the newlyweds set off on their honeymoon.
dialog: Chuck tells Bill to move his things from the dorm into the Belvedere.

speaker_heading: 118	EXT. PRAIRIEI
text: They steer out across the prairie in a1912 Overland auto. Ursula runs after them, slaps the back fender and hops around on one foot, pretending the other was run over. Abby laughs. She knows this stunt.
dialog: When they are gone Ursula turns fiercely on Bill.U
speaker_heading: URSULA
dialog: I hate you.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: What for? Don't be any more of a pain in the neck than you gotta

speaker_heading: BILL

speaker_heading: URSULA
dialog: You scum.
dialog: Bill slaps her.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Still think so?
text: She throws a rock at him and runs off. He catches her, repenting of his meanness.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I know you can't understand this, but there's nothing I want except good things for Abby and you. Go ahead and hit me back.
text: She hesitates a second, then slaps him as hard as she can. Blood glistens on his lip. He does not say a word in protest. She looks at the wound, horrified, then throws her arms tight around him.
speaker_heading: 119	EXT. PIERI
dialog: Abby and Chuck disembark from a paddleboat steamer at a
text: pier along the river. Chuck looks excited.
speaker_heading: 120	EXT. YELLOWSTONE POOL

speaker_heading: 121	EXT. ANTLERS - FREEZE FRAME
text: Chuck kneels with a box camera to photograph a large pair of antlers lying on the ground.
speaker_heading: 122	SERIES OF STILLS (STOCK)
text: This photo becomes the first in a series from their Yellowstone trip: fishermen displaying sensational catches by a river, buggies vying with early autos on rutted roads, the giant Beaupre who stood eight feet tall, etc. Each of the pictures bears a caption. Together they make a little story.
speaker_heading: ABBY (o.s.)
dialog: We saw grizzly bears and a boar. The bears scared me the most.
dialog: They eat garbage.
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: I was so lonesome. I missed you.
speaker_heading: 123	TIGHT ON BILL AND ABBY
dialog: Bill and Abby kiss, renewing old ties.U
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: There was a mountain partly made of glass, too, but we didn't get to see it. And a petrified tree.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: We'll go back.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Can we? Because there's a whole lot I didn't get to see.
text: Bill straightens up. Chuck sits down on Abby's other side.
speaker_heading: 124	EXT. DINNER TABLE UNDER NETI
text: They are having dinner on the lawn in front of the Belvedere. A fine mesh net is spread above them like a tent to keep the insects out. Ursula sits on Bill's lap. He puts a hand up the back of her shirt and they play as though she were a ventriloquist's dummy.
speaker_heading: 125	TIGHT ON RABBIT
text: Bill displays a rabbit which he trained in their absence to perform a card trick.
speaker_heading: BILL (o.s.)
dialog: I have you now, Ed. Only thing that can beat me is the ace of spades. (His name's Ed..) Her name's Abigail. Hungarian name.

speaker_heading: 126	NEW ANGLE

text: Chuck turns to Abby and, for nearly the first time, smiles.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: He's funny.
text: Bill holds a plate up for Abby to see. Limoges china. Abby rolls her eyes and spits out a cherry pit. They eat like pigs, with no respect for bourgeois manners.
speaker_heading: URSULA
dialog: You have any talents, Chuck?
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: No, but I admire people who do.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: That's not so. He can do a duck. Show them.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Stand back. Get the women and children someplace safe.
text: Chuck, feeling it would be wrong not to enter the spirit of the occasion, does his imitation. The likeness is astonishing. Abby wipes a bit of food off his chin with her napkin. Bill drums on the table with his spoon.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: You saw how modest he was?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: How'd you get along so long without a woman?
text: Chuck shrugs. Ursula makes a gesture as though to say by masturbating. Chuck does not see it. Billy laughs. Abby slaps her. The rabbit jumps out of the way.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Don't you ever behave that way at table!
dialog: (to Chuck)
dialog: She's adopted. I had nothing to do with her upbringing. I'd trade her off for a yellow dog.
dialog: (to Ursula)
dialog: Now eat. You want to starve to death?
speaker_heading: URSULA
dialog: That's what you'd like.
text: Abby, overcome with impatience, throws her food to the dogs. Ursula catches a grasshopper and holds it out to Chuck.
speaker_heading: URSULA
dialog: You give me a quarter to eat this hopper?
text: Chuck does not reply. She pops it into her mouth anyway, enjoying his look of shock. Bill throws down his fork.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: All right, okay, nobody's hungry anymore. What's the worst thing you ever did, Chuck? Besides missing church and that kind of stuff.
dialog: Chuck thinks about this.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Once I turned a man out in the middle of winter, without a cent of pay. For all I know he froze.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: If you went that far, he must've deserved it. What else?
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: He didn't. I fired him out of resentment.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Well, you're the boss, right? That's how it works. Got to make decisions on the spot. Anyway, this guy-what's his name?--if I know his kind, which I do, he's probably doing okay for himself, got a hand in
dialog: somebody else's pocket for a change. Is that all?
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: All I can think of right now. How about yourself?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (to Abby)
dialog: He wants to know. I'm not going to count setting Blackie's
dialog: on fire either. He had it coming.
speaker_heading: BILL (con't)
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Once I punched a guy while he was asleep.
text: Chuck looks surprised. Bill glances at Abby, worried that he might have said too much.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I was just kidding. Actually a guy I know did, though.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Maybe he did it to you.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Yeah. I think so.
text: Chuck gets up to ring for Miss Carter. Bill looks him up and down. Chuck, though older, is physically more imposing.
speaker_heading: URSULA
dialog: Can I have the rabbit?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Get serious. I can win money with him.
text: She licks his ear. He laughs.
speaker_heading: URSULA
dialog: I want that bunny.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: You still believe in Santa Claus.
text: Bill closes his eyes as he feels the soft fur of the rabbit. Ursula looks around to make sure Chuck is gone, then wings a roll at Bill. It bounces off his forehead. He retaliates with a pat of butter.
speaker_heading: 127	BENSON
text: Benson watches from another hill. He finds his displacement by these newcomers a humiliating injustice.
speaker_heading: 128	NEW ANGLE
text: Chuck returns to the table and draws Bill aside.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
text: Almost forgot. Here's your pay. Bill takes the envelope Chuck holds out. Then, in a spasm of conscience, he gives it back.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: hat's the matter?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I got no right to.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Why?
dialog: Bill is momentarily at a loss for words.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I haven't worked hard enough to deserve it. I been goofing off.I
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Don't be silly.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Give it to charity or something.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Don't worry. I always know to look out for myself, because ifI
dialog: I don't, who will? See what I'm driving at?
dialog: Chuck sees a sense of honor at work in Bill here, and
dialog: though he considers the gesture misguided and a little
dialog: grand, admires him for it.
speaker_heading: 129	EXT. BASESU
dialog: They play a game with big lace pillows for bases. The
dialog: rules are unintelligible.
speaker_heading: 130	NEW ANGLE
text: Bill is expert at throwing knives. As the others watch, he goes into a big windup and pins a playing card to the side of the house.U
text: Everyone seems happy and congenial. They have reached some kind of plateau. Chuck's ignorance of the ruse does not cause the others to treat him with less respect. They seem themselves almost to have forgotten it.
speaker_heading: 131	BILL AND ABBY'S POV - LATERU
dialog: Benson collects the bases, a job he doubtless feels is beneath him.
text: The Doctor's wagon, unmistakable even at such a great distance, thunders away from the Belvedere.
speaker_heading: 132	TIGHT ON BILL AND ABBYU
dialog: Bill and Abby, waiting for Chuck to join them for a swim,U
dialog: look questioningly at each other.S

speaker_heading: 134	TIGHT ON ABBY AND URSULA - LATER
dialog: Abby is teaching Ursula how to kiss.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Too like a mule.
speaker_heading: URSULA
dialog: (trying again)

dialog: It's got to be--how should I say?-- more relaxed.
dialog: They laugh and kiss again.
speaker_heading: 135	NEW ANGLE
text: Farther up the slope Bill and Chuck wring out their bathing suits. Bill, thinking of the Doctor's visit, puts a hand on Chuck's shoulder. This time Chuck does not stiffen or ease it off.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Sure. Why?
text: Bill shrugs, beaming with admiration for this man who does not burden others with his secrets.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I appreciate everything you've done for Abby. I really do. You've given her all the things she always deserved. I got to admit you have.
text: Chuck looks off, embarrassed but oddly pleased. Bill snatches up a handful of weeds and smells them.
dialog: .
speaker_heading: 136	CRANE SHOT
dialog: Returning home they portray the movements of the sun, earth and moon
dialog: relative to each other. Abby is the sun and keeps up a steady pace across

speaker_heading: 137	EXT. PRAIRIE - SERIES OF ANGLES
text: They play golf on the infinite fairway of the prairie. Bill and Abby make a team against Chuck and Ursula. Nightingales call out like mermaids from the sea.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: You liking it here?
dialog: (she nods)
dialog: Feel good?
dialog: (she nods)
dialog: Feels good to feel good.
text: He smiles, satisfied that he has done well by her, and lets a new ball slip down his pant leg to replace the one he played.
speaker_heading: 138	NEW ANGLE
text: Ursula, meanwhile, grinds Abby's ball into the dirt with the heel of her boot. She winks at Chuck. Chuck smiles back.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: What's your mother like?
speaker_heading: URSULA
dialog: Her? Like somebody that just got hit on the head. She used to pray for me. Rosary, the stations, everything. "Hey, Ma," I tell her, "I ain't crippled." They don't know, though. They say you're in trouble. They don't know.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: My dad, the same way. Thought the world owed him a living. He drowned in Lake Michigan.
speaker_heading: 139	EXT. BELVEDERE
text: They walk home. Bill stays behind to work on his strokes. Ursula sends the dogs after the balls.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: You shag them, not those dogs. They might choke or run off with them.
speaker_heading: URSULA
dialog: Who made you the boss? Shag them yourself.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Listen, some day all this is going to be mine. Or half is. Somebody like that, you want to get on his good side, not give him a lot of gas. You want to do what he says.
text: He steps off a few paces of his future kingdom and draws a deep breath.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: This reminds me of where I came from. I left when I was six. That's when I met your sister.
text: He looks at the land with a new sense of reverence. He snatches up a handful of grass and rolls it between his palms.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I can't wait to go back to Chicago, bring them down for a visit. Blackie and them. There's a lot of satisfaction in showing up people who thought you'd never amount to anything.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I'd really like to see this place run right. I got a lot of ideas I'd like to try out.
speaker_heading: 140	BILL'S POV AND TIGHT ON BILL
text: In the distance he sees Chuck put his arm on Abby's waist and whisper something in her ear. This intimacy rubs him the wrong way. He gives his clubs to Ursula and starts after them.
speaker_heading: 141	INT. KITCHEN
text: Bill finds them in the kitchen. Chuck goes into the other room to look for something. Abby lifts the cigarette out of Bill's mouth, takes a drag and does a French inhale. Bill kisses her.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Nobody's all bad, are they?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I met a few I was wrong on, then.
text: Suddenly they hear Chuck's footsteps. They pull back just in time, Abby returning the cigarette to him behind her back. They chat as though nothing had happened.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I have a headache. I probably should've worn a hat.
text: Abby rolls her eyes at this improvisation. No sooner does Chuck turn his back than Bill's hand darts out to touch her breast. He snatches it away a moment before Chuck turns back.
dialog: Together they walk into the living room.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: You ever see anybody out here?
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Not after harvest.

speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Once or twice a year.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: You're kidding. He must be kidding.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Why do I need to?
text: Bill catches Abby's eyes. He frowns at the idea of being cooped up with this Mormon all winter.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Relaxation. Look at the girls. Opportunity to see how other folks live.
text: Chuck looks at him blankly. None of these reasons seems to carry
dialog: much weight for him. Bill turns to Abby.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Somebody is nuts. I don't know whether it's him or me, but somebody is definitely nuts.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Why don't I fix tea?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Maybe I should help you.
text: He follows her back into the kitchen, where he starts to kiss her. She pushes him away and turns to making the tea.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: You're worse than an Airedale.
dialog: (raising her voice)
dialog: You want jasmine or mint?
speaker_heading: CHUCK (o.s.)
dialog: Mint.
text: Bill lifts up the back of her dress and looks under it, testing the breadth of his license. She slaps it back down. He lifts it again, standing on his right to. She glowers at him.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Don't do that.
dialog: (calling to Chuck)
dialog: How much sugar?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Why not? I'm just seeing what kind of material it's made of.
speaker_heading: CHUCK (o.s.)
dialog: One spoonful.
text: Bill walks around absentmindedly, inspecting Chuck's things, stealing whatever catches his fancy. A book, a paperweight, a bell--things he does not really want and has no use for. His conscience is clear, however; the sacrifices they are making excuse these little sins.
text: As Chuck walks in, Bill has pocketed a candlestick.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Where's the candlestick?
text: Chuck shrugs. Bill gives Abby a cold look and goes outside.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: He's a strange one.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Once he named his shoes like they were pets. It was a joke, I guess.
speaker_heading: 142	EXT. WELL
text: Bill drops the candlestick down the well, stands for a moment, then punches the bucket with his fist. He looks up. Benson has seen him.
scene_heading: 143	EXT. SAPLINGS AGAINST WINDOW - NIGHT
text: Outside the saplings thrash in the wind.
speaker_heading: 144	INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Abby wakes up with a gasp.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: What's the matter?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: I had a dream.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: What about?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Was something after you?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: I forgot it already.
speaker_heading: 145	AERIAL SHOT (STOCK)
text: The camera falls through the clouds as though in a lost fragment of Abby's dreams.
speaker_heading: 146	EXT. BARN
text: Benson sulks by the barn. Chuck approaches him.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: You come down here a lot, don't you? Always when you're mad. You never change.
speaker_heading: BENSON
dialog: It might not be my place to say this, sir, but I don't think they're honest people.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: He gets on your nerves, doesn't he? He always has.
dialog: (cutting in)
dialog: Now don't say something you're going to regret.
dialog: .
speaker_heading: BENSON
dialog: Why should I regret it? I think they're a pair of scam artists,
dialog: sir. Let me tell you what I've seen, and you judge for yourself.
text: Chuck, who of course has seen the same things and more, raises a hand to silence him.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Maybe you'd be happier taking over the north end till spring. I don't say this in anger. We've been together a long time, and I've always felt about you like, well, close. It just might work out better is all. Less friction.
speaker_heading: BENSON
dialog: Don't believe me, then. You shouldn't. But why not check it out, sir? Hire a detective in Chicago. It won't cost much. What's there to lose?
text: Chuck's brow darkens as Benson goes on. For a moment we glimpse the anger that would be unleashed if ever he woke up. Somewhere he already knows the truth but refuses to acknowledge it.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: You're talking about my wife.
dialog: And so Chuck, too, becomes an accomplice in the scheme.
speaker_heading: BENSON
dialog: Maybe I better pack my things.
text: Benson turns and walks off. Chuck watches him go, ashamed at himself. What has this man done but a friend's duty?
speaker_heading: 147	INT. MASTER BEDROOM
text: Abby sits at the dresser in the master bedroom. Bill walks in through the door and tries Chuck's hat on for size.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: What're you doing in here?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Just walked in through the door, like any other white man.
text: On the bureau he finds a pistol. He aims it out the window. All this will soon be theirs!
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Smith and Wesson. You ought to see one of these plow into a watermelon.
text: She holds a hairbrush out for him to see. He looks it over and gives it back without comment. He finds a stain on the tabletop.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Somebody's been staining this fake inlay with a water glass. Actually I don't blame them.
text: He walks around trying out more of Chuck's appurtenances. Abby, caught up, models a shawl before an imaginary mirror. She blows a kiss at herself.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Don't say I did that.
speaker_heading: BILL
text: The bed should be over next to the window. Where the view is.
dialog: Bill is already making plans for life after Chuck's demise.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Maybe we build on a balcony.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: First the birds go.
text: The peacocks are crowing outside. They burst out laughing. Bill checks the mussed bedsheets.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: That doesn't concern you.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Why not?
dialog: (no reply)
dialog: Look, I know you've got urges. It wouldn't be right if you didn't.
dialog: Abby stands up, angry.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: You think I enjoy it?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Lower your voice.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: You act like it's harder on you than me! I never want to talk
dialog: about this again.
text: Bill, consoled, holds an eyelet blouse against the light.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I bet he enjoys looking at you in this.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: I thought you liked it.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: He likes it, too, is what I'm saying.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Well, it's the style.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I see.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: What do you want me to wear in this heat? A blanket?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: That's your problem.
text: Abby puts on her wedding bracelet and admires it. Bill softens at the sight of her beauty, properly adorned.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I told you someday we'd be living in style. When this whole thing is over I'm going to buy you a necklace with diamonds as big as that.
text: He holds out the tip of his little finger. They laugh, as though they suddenly felt the absurdity of all this make-believe.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: You're cute. Maybe a shade too cute.
text: She touches his face sympathetically, as though to say that she knows the pain this was causing him.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: This is terrible for us both.
speaker_heading: CHUCK (o.s.)
dialog: Abby?
dialog: They jump as Chuck calls up from downstairs.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Down in a minute.
dialog: She kisses Bill.
speaker_heading: 148	EXT. BACK DOOR OF BELVEDERE
text: Bill sneaks out the back door of' the Belvedere, only to find Benson drinking at the well. They look at each other in silence for a moment. Benson's horse stands beside him, a suitcase fixed to the saddle.
speaker_heading: BENSON
dialog: I know what you're doing.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: What're you talking about?
speaker_heading: BENSON
dialog: That boy's like a son to me. Don't you forget it. I know what you're doing.
text: Benson gets on his horse, turns and rides off. Miss Carter waves goodbye from the side of the house. She and Bill exchange a look.
speaker_heading: 149	EXT. FRONT PORCH
text: Bill finds the others around front. Abby lolls in the hammock writing in her diary and eating a peach. Ursula plays the guitar.
text: Little by little the newcomers have done the house over from the austere structure that it was. Living room furniture has been moved out onto the front lawn and there arranged as though by a child. Goats sleep on the divan. Archery targets hang from the side of the house. The porch is covered with a striped awning, bird cages and twirls of bunting. Everywhere an atmosphere of drunken ease prevails.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Nice fall day.
speaker_heading: URSULA
dialog: Wish I'd said that.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (to Abby)
dialog: Watcha doing?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Eating a green peach. 'Spect to die any minute.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Listen, I had a great idea. Let's spend Christmas in Chicago. Break
dialog: up the old routine. Rhino's never been to a baseball game or a horse
dialog: race. I know guys one month off the boat that have. Don't even
dialog: speak the English language, but they eat it right up.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: You're just a young guy, Rhino; you oughta be running around
dialog: raising hell. No offense to the little woman.
text: He bows apologetically to Abby. She pinches a dead leaf off a plant.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Abby says that in the poor section people eat cats.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Did you, sis? Well, there's always something doing. I can't
dialog: begin to tell you. State and Madison? Mmmm. Lights everywhere.
dialog: You'd love it.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: It can be rough, though.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Rough? Listen, you can't walk down the street without somebody
dialog: reaching in your pocket! You've got to keep your coat like this
dialog: and poke them away.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Bill got shot once. The bullet's still in him.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Doctor said he took it out, but I never saw it. Hurt like a bastard.
dialog: You got no idea how it hurt.
dialog: Suddenly he worries this might discourage Chuck from going.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: They won't mess with you, though. Big fella like you. I can see it
dialog: now.
dialog: He offers a taste of the talk Chuck is like to provoke on the street corners.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: "Hey, hey, hey. Who's this here, fresh out of the African Jungle,
text: moving down the sidewalk with a whowhowho, taking ten feet at a step
dialog: and making all the virgins run for cover? Why, it's Big Rhino, the
dialog: King of Beasts. He walks, he talks, he sucks up chalk."
text: Bill steps back and sees, as though for the first time, how imposing Chuck really is.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: You are big, aren't you? Sunny Jim! You must've had a real moose
dialog: for an old lady.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Take it easy.
dialog: But Chuck holds none of this against him. He knows it comes from respect.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: So what do you say?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: What a sorry outfit! Bunch of old ladies. You better stay behind.
dialog: Your mammas'd probably get upset.
dialog: But when the time comes, I'm out of here. Hit the road, Toad!
dialog: Ursula passes the sandwiches around until there is just
text: one left, Miss Carter's. While the others are talking,
text: she scoops up a handful of dirt and pours it into the middle.
text: Bill, lighting a cigarette, notices Chuck's hand on Abby's.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Ever seen a match burn twice?
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: No.
text: Bill blows out the match and touches Chuck's hand with
text: the hot ember, causing him to yank it away.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: That's old.
text: Chuck starts to cough. Bill looks at Abby, then whips the handkerchief out of his pocket and puts it over his nose, as though to keep from getting Chuck's germs.
text: Miss Carter's face goes blank as she bites into her sandwich.
text: She jumps up and rushes back into the house. Chuck frowns.
text: Bill glares at Ursula, then turns to Chuck and, referring to the dead prairie grass which runs through the front yard right up to the house, continues:
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: You ever thought of putting in some fescue here? Some fescue grass?
dialog: Of course, it might not take in this soil.
text: Chuck stands up and winds a stole, a long religious scarf, around his neck.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: You ready?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I still have a little of this sore throat. Where you going, though?
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: To kill a hog.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: What's the necktie for?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Or does it just come in handy?
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Keeps the stain of guilt off.
text: Chuck nods goodbye and walks off, taking a stool with him. Bill sighs with admiration.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I try and try.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: What a splendid person! I've never met anybody like him!
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Splendid people make you nervous.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: They do! I breathe a sigh of relief when they step outside the room.
text: Bill puts on his boater and opens a copy of the Police Gazette.
dialog: They are silent for a moment.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: A guy ate a brick on a bet. Must of busted it up first with a hammer. Guy in New York City. Where else?
dialog: (Jumping up)
dialog: Anybody want to bet me I can't stick this knife in that post?
dialog: Nobody takes him up on this. Abby leafs through the
dialog: Sears catalogue, her mind dancing with visions of splendor.
speaker_heading: 150	TIGHT ON CATALOGUE
text: Pictured. in the catalogue are bath oils and corsets and feathered hats. A grasshopper is perched on the page among them, its eyes blank and dumb.
speaker_heading: 151	TIGHT ON ROSE
text: Bill watches her run her finger slowly around the closed heart of a rose. Suddenly they both look at each other. They have heard the squeals, faint but unmistakable, of a hog being led to slaughter.
speaker_heading: 152	TIGHT ON STOOL - QUICK CUT
text: Chuck has tied the hog's feet to the inverted legs of the stool.
speaker_heading: 153	OTHER QUICK CUTS
dialog: Ursula, off by herself, skips rope.
text: A flag on the pole by the front gate snaps in the breeze. From the branch of a lone tree the hog dangles by its hocks into the mouth of a barrel.
scene_heading: 154	EXT. BELVEDERE - ABBY'S POV FROM SECOND FLOOR WINDOW
text: Miss Carter storms down the hill with her bags. Fed up, she is leaving the bonanza. Chuck tries in vain to appease her. She keeps walking, out the front gate and into the prairie on a straight course for the railroad tracks.
dialog: Chuck will now be alone at the Belvedere with the newcomers and no other point of reference.
speaker_heading: 155	EXT. CLOTHES LINE
text: Later that afternoon, Bill catches sight of Abby's underthings rustling on the clothes line.
speaker_heading: 156	INT. STAIRS
text: That evening he watches her from behind as she climbs the stairs to join Chuck at their bedroom door. She nods goodnight, sensing the jealousy that is growing in him.
speaker_heading: 157	INT. MASTER BEDROOM
text: Chuck looks impatiently through a drawer.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: I can't find anything around here. Last week it was my gloves; this
dialog: week my talc. What's going on?
text: He stands and watches Abby get ready for bed. She fills him with a deep adoration. He feels that in the tulip of her mouth at last he has found heaven.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: You're beautiful.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: You don't think my skin's too fair?
text: He comes up behind her and touches her long hair.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: You're smart, too, aren't you?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: I know what the Magna Carta is.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Can I help you brush it out?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Not right now.
dialog: She is cold to discourage false expectations in him--and because she feels that she at least owes Bill this. Chuck, however, assumes the fault must be his own. His naivete about women, and the world in general, protects
dialog: the conspirators--and protects him, too, for he glimpses enough of the truth not to want to know any more.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: What makes you so distant with me?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Distant? I don't mean to be.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: You know what I'm talking about, though. You aren't that way
dialog: with your brother.
speaker_heading: 158	INT.ATTIC
text: Bill, eavesdropping in the attic above them, surveys Chuck's dusty heirlooms.
speaker_heading: CHUCK (o.s.)
dialog: It must be something I'm doing. I wish you'd tell me what, though.
speaker_heading: 159	INT. BEDROOM
text: These gentle endearments, so rarely heard from Bill, stir her deeply. She throws herself in his arms.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Oh, Chuck I Please forgive me. Does it mean anything that I'm
dialog: sorry?
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: (pleased)
dialog: But I don't blame you. Did I make it sound that way?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: You should. You have a right to.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: It's just that sometimes I feel I don't know you well.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: You don't. It's true.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: I think you love me better than before, though.
text: She rubs her cheek against his hands. Daily she feels warmer toward him. How much of this is love, how much respect or devotion, even she cannot say.
speaker_heading: 160	TIGHT ON BILL - LATER - NIGHT
text: The night throbs with crickets. Bill cracks open the bedroom door. Chuck lies asleep in a shaft of moonlight next to Abby. He hesitates a moment, but a strange compulsion drives him on. He has never done anything
dialog: so dangerous, or had so little idea why.
speaker_heading: 161	INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Abby wakes up to find him staring her in the face. He kisses her. Chuck stirs. Abby signals they should go outside.
scene_heading: 162	EXT. BELVEDERE - DAY FOR NIGHT
text: They sneak out of the Belvedere. The night is warm.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: You're no good.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Mmmm. But I love you.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: I can't stand it any more. This is just so cruel. We're both no
dialog: good. I've got to get drunk with you, Bill. You know what I mean?
dialog: Drunk.
text: Bill wags a bottle. The dogs, awakened, bay from the kennel. They wait a moment to see if a light will go on in the house, then dart off toward the fields. A plaster lawn dwarf seems to watch them go.
speaker_heading: 163	EXT. FIELDS - DAY FOR NIGHT
text: They run through the fields, hand in hand, laughing and flirting. The moon makes Abby's nightgown a ghostly white.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: We can never do this again, though. Okay? It really is too dangerous.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: This one night.
dialog: He toes a sodden old shoe.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Hey, I found a shoe.
speaker_heading: 164	SHOE, COYOTES, SCARECROW - DAY FOR NIGHT
text: The shoe gleams in the moonlight. Coyotes yelp from the hilltops. A scarecrow spreads its arms against the sky. The waving fields of wheat have given way to vast reaches of cleanly shaven stubble, stained with purple morning glories. Odd, large stakes are planted among them.
speaker_heading: 165	NEW ANGLE - DAY FOR NIGHT
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: You want me to spin you around?
text: She nods okay. He takes her by the hands and spins her around the way he used to--until they go reeling off, too dizzy to stand.
scene_heading: 166	EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY FOR NIGHT
text: They lie by the river looking at the great dome of stars. Bill wants to believe things are the same between them as before. So does Abby--but she knows better.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Suppose we woke up tomorrow and it was a thousand years ago. I
dialog: mean, with all we know? Electricity, the telephone, radio, that kind of
dialog: stuff. They'd never figure out how we came up with it all. Maybe
dialog: they'd kill us.
text: She looks at him, and they laugh.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: You sleepy?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: This is the first time we slept together in a while, Bill.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: You like it?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Kiss me, then.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: It's so sweet to be able to kiss you when I want to.
speaker_heading: 167	NEW ANGLE
text: Before the marriage his lovemaking was gentle and soft. Now it has a brutal air, as though he were asserting his right to her for the last time.
speaker_heading: 168	TIGHT ON ABBY - DAWN
text: Dawn is breaking. Abby jumps to her feet, alarmed. They have slept too long.
speaker_heading: 169	EXT. BELVEDERE - DAWN
text: They have run back to the Belvedere. It seems they are safe until Chuck appears on the porch, yawning and stretching. Bill drops to the ground while Abby goes ahead.
text: Abby appears at one side of the house while Bill steals around the other. Luckily, they have come up from the back.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Abby! I've been looking all over for you. Where have you been?
text: While she distracts Chuck, Bill slips back in the house. It has been a close call.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Watching the ducks.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Didn't you sleep well?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: 170	TIGHT ON ABBY (DISSOLVE TO PAGE, THEN TO URSULA)
text: Abby looks sympathetically at Chuck. Her face dissolves into a page of her diary and from there to Ursula, balancing an egg on her fingertip.
speaker_heading: ABBY (o.s.)
dialog: Chuck saw Ursula balance an egg. He begged her to repeat this trick,
dialog: but she wouldn't.
speaker_heading: 171	TIGHT ON CHUCK
text: Chuck tries to reduplicate Ursula's feat. Abby, amused, reaches out and touches his face.
dialog: We wonder if, despite herself, she might be falling in love with him.
speaker_heading: 172	EXT. BELVEDERE
text: Bill watches the Doctor walk out the front door and down the steps to his wagon. Chuck follows, smiling.
speaker_heading: ABBY (o.s.)
dialog: The Doctor came. Chuck looked pleased for a change.
speaker_heading: 173	EXT. PRAIRIE - BILL'S POV
text: The Doctor's wagon rolls off across the prairie.
speaker_heading: ABBY (o.s.)
text: Tomorrow the President passes through. Plans have changed, and he can't stop.
speaker_heading: 174	EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - DUSK
dialog: They have come down to the railroad tracks to watch the President pass through.
speaker_heading: URSULA
dialog: We should have brought a flag.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Does she have time to ride back and get it?
text: Abby and Bill hold hands. Chuck by now is accustomed to such displays. They seem, however, to make Abby increasingly uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: 175	MOVING TRAIN - THEIR POVS
text: The train bursts past at twenty yards, its great light rolling like a lunatic eye. Bill's heart pounds with excitement. Chuck holds Abby by the waist. Ursula waves a handkerchief... They cannot make out anything specific in the windows, but there is the sense of people going more important places, getting on with the serious business of their lives - while out here they stagnate.
text: Dimly visible, on the back platform of the caboose, a MAN in a frock coat salutes them with his cane.
text: The train has quickly vanished into the declining sun. Everything is quiet again. Ursula rushes up the grade to collect some pennies she laid on the tracks.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Did you see him wave?
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: He was shorter than I expected.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: How do you know it was him?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: I saw! He had a hat on.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: You didn't understand my question.
text: They walk back to the buggy. Ursula holds up a dead snake she found on the tracks.
speaker_heading: URSULA
dialog: You know what I'm going to do with this? Take it home and put it in
dialog: vinegar.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: That was the President, shortie. Wake up.
text: Bill watches Chuck help Abby into the buggy. She is laughing about something or other. His hand lingers for a moment on hers. She does not brush it aside, as once she might have, but to Bill's dismay, presses
dialog: it against her breast. Chuck seems to have breathed a hope into her that he, Bill, was never able to.
speaker_heading: 176	EXT. FIELDS
text: Abby and Ursula race across the fields trying to fly a kite. Ursula rides a tiny Shetland pony. Just as the wind lifts the kite away, they run into Bill. He sits by himself observing a spear of grass. Abby drops off. Ursula rides off over the hill with the kite, leaving her alone with Bill.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: You look deep in thought.
text: She touches his cheek. He brushes her hand away.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: What's the matter?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: There's nothing wrong?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: What're you so mad about then?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Who said I was mad?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Can't I be alone once in a while without everybody getting all
dialog: worked up?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: You're the only person getting worked up.
text: Some buffalo appear on the crest of the next hill. Abby looks at them. They do not seem quite part of this world but mythical, like minotaurs.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Chuck says they're good for the grass.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Stop giving me that look.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: You can't keep your hands off him these days.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: What're you talking about?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: You know.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: I haven't touched him.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: How about the other night? I saw you, Abby. The other night
dialog: by the tracks? If only you wouldn't lie! Really, there's
dialog: some things about you I'm never going to understand.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: I forgot. Anyway it doesn't matter. What are you doing, always trying
dialog: to trap me?
text: Bill paces around, disgusted with himself and the whole situation.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I can't stand it any more. It's just too degrading.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: You and him. Why do I have to spell it out? I thought it would be all
dialog: over in a month or two. Guy might go another five years. We've got to
dialog: clear out, Abby.
text: They stare at each other in silence for a moment.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Why stop now?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: We've come this far.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: You heard me.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Why stay? Go ahead and tell me! I'm standing here.
text: Bill trembles with shock and anger. The buffalo cast aware glances at them.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: You want us to lose everything?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I'm telling you I can't stand it.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: You're weak then. What about all I've been through?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: And what about him? It would be the worst thing we could do. Worse
dialog: than anything so far. It would break his heart.
dialog: Bill is silent for a moment.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: You're getting to like him, aren't you?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: It would kill him. Leaving now would be just cruel.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Would it? So what's it matter to somebody in his shape?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: In fact you're just leaving us one way out.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: What're you talking about? Murdering him? Ursula comes riding over the hill, without the kite.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: You watch and see.
speaker_heading: URSULA
dialog: I had to let it go. One of them started following me, and I threw
dialog: a rock at him. I had a bunch stored in my pocket.
dialog: They take off running after her.
speaker_heading: 177	EXT. BELVEDERE
text: As they approach the Belvedere, Bill sees Chuck standing on the front steps. Suddenly angry, he draws Abby to him and in plain view kisses her on the lips.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: He can see you!
text: Bill nods; he knows. Abby runs ahead, angry and alarmed.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Don't you believe in being honest?
speaker_heading: 178	NEW ANGLE
text: Abby bounds up the steps. Chuck has bent his mind to understand all this as mere sibling love, but here is the greatest test so far.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Aren't you going to kiss me?
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Today's my birthday.
text: Chuck gives her a kiss, glad to put aside his suspicions.
speaker_heading: 179	TIGHT ON POINTERS, QUAIL AND PHEASANTS
text: Tails level, their noses thrust high in the air, a pair of pointers prance through the high uplands grass, following a scent like sailors taking in a rope. Pheasants and quail tremble in their coveys, their eyes big with fear.
speaker_heading: 180	EXT. UPLANDS
text: Chuck has taken Bill out bird-hunting. They wear heavy canvas leggings and carry shotguns.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Did you ever tell Abby the buffalo help keep up the grass?
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: I think so. Why?
text: Bill shrugs. Chuck welcomes this opportunity to speak of his wife. He considers Bill a good friend, in fact the only person with whom he can talk about delicate matters.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: I want to get her something nice for Christmas.
text: Bill, who means to kill Chuck the first chance he gets, forgets this intention for a moment to give him advice.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (thoughtfully)
dialog: She likes to draw. Maybe some paints. Nothing too expensive--
dialog: she might want to exchange it. Maybe a coat. She likes to show
dialog: off sometimes. She's sweet that way.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: I wish I knew how to make her happy. Nothing I do really seems to.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: That's how they are. They like to make you work for it. I couldn't
dialog: ever figure out why.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Sometimes you can't go wrong, though. You know that one Abby showed you a picture of? Elizabeth? I took her cherry.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: I know. You told me.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Actually, I didn't, but I could have. The point I'm making is you've got
dialog: to understand how they operate. Get them thinking you can take it or
dialog: leave it, you're usually okay.
text: Suddenly the dogs stop rigid, on point. At Chuck's hiss they sink into the grass.
text: Bill looks at Chuck's exposed back. Nobody would know. It could be made to seem like a hunting accident. He cocks the hammer of his shotgun. His heart pounds wildly. Chuck talks in a low voice to the dogs.
speaker_heading: CHUCK (o.s.)
dialog: All right, put them up, girl.
text: The dogs rise and inch toward the birds, as slowly as the minute hand of a clock. All at once the quail explode out of hiding. Bill jumps at the noise. Chuck fires twice. Two birds fall. The retriever notes where. Chuck turns around.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Why aren't you shooting? I left you those two on the left.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: They caught me off guard.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: You have to keep your gun up.
text: Chuck walks ahead. The music builds a mood of tension. Bill takes a practice shot into the ground. Bill looks around. There is nobody in sight. He turns the sights on Chuck's back. It would be simple enough.
text: Though only twenty feet away, he closes the gap, to make sure he does not miss.
text: Chuck whistles the scattered birds back to their covey. "Pheo! Pheo!" Soon, faint and far away, comes a reply-the sweet, pathetic whistle of the quail lost in a forest of grass. The mother bird utters a low "all is well."
text: One by one, near and far, the note is taken up, and they begin to return.
text: Bill holds his breath. His finger moves inside the trigger guard. He only has to squeeze a fraction of an inch. Three more birds shoot out of the grass. Chuck fires. At first we think Bill has, but he cannot stoop this low. He does not have the heart. Disgusted, he throws his gun on the ground. Both barrels go off. Chuck snaps around, startled and concerned. Bill is
dialog: shaking like a leaf.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: What's the matter? What are you so upset about?
speaker_heading: BILL
text: They surprised me again. Chuck sends a retriever after the fallen birds, then--in an unprecedented gesture-he puts his arm over Bill's shoulder to comfort him, like an older brother.
speaker_heading: 181	NEW ANGLE
text: They return home, the day's kill slung over the back of a Shetland pony.
speaker_heading: 182	EXT. BACK YARD
text: They sit on stools in the back yard plucking the birds.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: You like to box?
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: I never have.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Just wondering. I got a pair of gloves I brought with me.
dialog: Bill feels oddly better, as though Chuck had backed down.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Abby bought me this at Yellowstone.
text: Chuck shows Bill his knife. Bill reads a name off the handle.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: That's what she calls you? 'Chickie?'
text: He gets up, his nostrils flaring with anger. Chuck thinks this indignance is on his behalf.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Doesn't bother me. Should it?
text: Bill throws down the pheasant he was plucking.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: What's the matter?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Don't let her fool you, too. She warms up to whoever says please and thank you.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: What's the matter?
text: Bill, still angry at himself, considers telling him.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: You really want to know?
dialog: He would like Chuck to know the truth but does not want theresponsibility for revealing it. He must find out by accident.
text: Luckily they are interrupted as Ursula runs up, pointing over her shoulder. A pair of three-wing airplanes sputters into view low overhead. One seems to be having engine trouble.
speaker_heading: 183	EXT. FIELD NEAR BELVEDERE
text: The planes set down in a nearby field. "Toto's Flying Circus" is emblazoned on the wings.
speaker_heading: 184	NEW ANGLE
text: Five PEOPLE clamber out, members of a seedy vaudeville troupe. They swagger around, filthy with oil from the backwash of the props, looking more like convicts than entertainers. Their LEADER is an excitable Levantine.
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: How long it take to fix? Very mooch time! Now look where you
dialog: hab stuck us. Salaupe! You forget who I aim!
text: Bill, Abby and Ursula approach the aircraft with the greatest caution, like the Indians at Cortez's ships.
speaker_heading: 185	EXT. SCREEN - NIGHT
speaker_heading: A JUGGLER and a SNAKE CHARMER perform first separately,
text: then jointly as a slap act. A DOUBLE TALKER weaves sentences of absolute nonsense. After a moment a black and white image appears over his face and he drops out of sight.
text: The troupe is putting on a show to earn its supper. ONE of them stands behind the viewers -- Abby and Bill, Chuck and Ursula -- cranking a carbide projector by hand. A silent movie appears on the screen, full of extraordinary pratfalls, disappearances and other tricks of the early
dialog: cinema. Chuck has never seen anything remotely like this.
speaker_heading: CHUCK (o.s.)
dialog: How'd they do that? Where'd he go? There must be a wire. Etc.
text: He steps forward to inspect the screen, actually just a sheet hung along a clothesline, to see whether the image is coming from behind. Bill and Abby sit rapt as children, nostalgic for Chicago.
speaker_heading: 186	EXT. DINNER TABLE - NIGHT
dialog: Ursula serves dinner. She is excited by the visitors'
dialog: city ways. They are bored with her, all except the
text: youngest, GEORGE, a young pilot in a white scarf.
speaker_heading: URSULA
dialog: We never hear a thing out here. It's like being on a boat in the
text: middle of a lake. You see things going on, but way far away, with no voices.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Maybe time to clear out.
text: George puts his hand on hers. She snatches it away.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What's the matter? Aren't I your
dialog: type or something?
text: The Doubletalker pokes his fork into a pudding. A balloon, concealed beneath the surface, explodes to general delight. Down the table Abby and Bill chat with the Leader.
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: You do not understand, sir. I am saddled with asses, yaays? I, who
dialog: once played the Albert Hall
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: You. hear that? He called me 'sir.'
text: In their gaiety he carelessly puts a hand on Abby's leg.
speaker_heading: 187	TIGHT ON CHUCK - NIGHT
text: Chuck looks on from the shadows, no longer just puzzled but angry. He has watched them behave this way a dozen times before, but tonight, with other people around, he must see it more directly.
speaker_heading: 188	EXT. STRAW STACK - NIGHT
text: George tells Ursula a joke. She dissolves in giggles before he can finish, as though amazed at his power to dispense illusion.
speaker_heading: 189	INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Chuck, alone in the darkened living room, calms himself down by breathing through a rubber mask into a respirator. Joyful noises reach him from outside.
speaker_heading: 190	CHUCK'S POV - NEXT MORNING
text: The next morning Chuck looks down out his bedroom window.
text: The troupe is packing to leave. Still troubled, he walks to the bed and and stands over Abby.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: What's going on, Abby?
text: She does not respond. He yanks the sheet off. She is wearing a nightgown. She looks up and frowns. This is the first time she has ever seen him this way.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: You know what I mean. Between you and Bill.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: I have no idea.....
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Something's not right, and I want to know what.
text: Abby jumps out of bed and assumes the offensive. She has no other choice.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Say it out loud. What're you worried about?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Incest?
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: It just doesn't look right. I don't know how brothers and
dialog: sisters carry on where you come from, but...
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Did you ever have a brother. Then who are you to judge? Maybe if
dialog: you had, you'd understand. Anyway, times have changed while you've been stuck out in this weed patch. We're
dialog: ************************line missing****************
text: She puts on a robe and walks out. Her last argument has worked best. Chuck never imagined he was in step with the times.
speaker_heading: 191	EXT. BELVEDERE
text: Abby slips out the front door. She looks around to make sure that Chuck is not watching her, then heads off to find Bill. The vaudevillians gorge themselves on last night's leftovers, steal flowers from the flower beds,
text: etc. ONE sits off by himself, playing a French horn.
speaker_heading: 192	EXT. DORM
text: She finds Bill by the dorm throwing a switchblade in the ground, a toothbrush in his mouth.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: I have to talk to you.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Look what I traded off those clowns. For a bushel of corn!
text: She draws him by the arm behind a wall. She is trembling with fear.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Chuck is suspicious.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Chickie you mean? So what?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Really. This is the first time he's ever been like this. I'm scared.
dialog: All this flatters Chuck in a way Bill does not like.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: What for? Why're you so worried what he thinks?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: He could kill us. I want to live a long time, okay? I just got
dialog: started and I like it.
text: Bill shrugs, as though to say he can handle whatever Chuck can dish out and a little more.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: You might take a little responsibility here. You got us into all this.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Did I? Well, it never would've come up if you hadn't led him on.
dialog: Led Chickie on!
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Is that the best you can do? Knowing you it probably is.
dialog: You've made a mess of our lives, okay. Don't pretend it was my
dialog: fault.
dialog: Bill combs his hair to calm himself down.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Why's this guy still hanging on like a goddamn snapping turtle?
dialog: Because of you. Boy, this was a great idea. Right up there
dialog: with Lincoln going down to the theater, see what's on!
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Keep your voice down.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Don't give me that. When a guy's getting screwed, he's got a right
dialog: to holler.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: You're such a fool!
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I heard what you said.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Then why'd you ask? Oh, how did I ever get mixed up with you?
text: Abby, in terror of Chuck's finding out, cannot understand why Bill seems to care so little.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: You've gone sweet on him. You have, haven't you?
text: Abby hesitates. Bill throws his knife away.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: I admire him. He's a good man.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Broad shoulders. I know. Very high morals. Why can't he talk
dialog: faster? It's like waiting for a hen to lay an egg.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: You wouldn't understand, though. He's not like you. You don't
dialog: know how people feel. You only think of yourself.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: What's going on between us, Abby? Think about that. If you figure it
dialog: out, tell me, will you? I'd appreciate it.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Lord, but you do come on! You talking like this, used to play
dialog: around right under his nose. Somebody I met in a bar, remember?
dialog: Or maybe you walked in, thought it was a church. Well, I've had
dialog: it.I'm clearing out. You understand?
dialog: They look at each other for a moment.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Go ahead.
dialog: This is not what he expected to hear. But now his pride requires that he face the truth and not back down.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Okay.
text: He looks at her for a moment. He cannot be dealt with this way. He turns and walks off.
speaker_heading: 193	NEW ANGLE
text: Ursula flirts with George. He slips a hand inside her blouse. She bats it away.
speaker_heading: 194	EXT. BEDROOM WINDOW
text: Bill stands on the ground below the master bedroom. Chuck leans out the window above him. Peacocks roost on the balcony, beneath the telescope. The vaudevillians are loading up their planes. Abby watches from the porch.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I'm going away for a while. They're giving me a lift.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: What for?
dialog: He shrugs.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I'm wearing one of your shirts. Let me take it off for you.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Never mind.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I got my own. Just wasn't any clean today.
text: Bill takes off the shirt, drapes it over a post and walks off, hurt and angry, but with a sad dignity.
text: Chuck is not entirely sorry to see him go, nor is Abby; she knows that he is getting out just in time. One more episode like last night's and the fuse would hit the powder.
speaker_heading: 195	NEW ANGLE
dialog: Bill gives Ursula his money.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: We get split up for any reason, you spend that on school.
speaker_heading: 196	EXT. PRAIRIE
text: The vaudevillians are ready to take off. Bill boards the plane which George is piloting, wondering if today's break with Abby is real or just in anger, a necessary gesture. With him he carries his only possessions, a bindle and his trick rabbit. Abby, Chuck and Ursula look on.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: What's eating him?
text: Abby shrugs and walks down to Ursula.
speaker_heading: URSULA
dialog: Why aren't we going with him?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: What for? To sleep in boxcars?
speaker_heading: 197	AIRPLANES
text: The planes set their wheels in the furrows, rev their engines and wobble off into the sky. Ursula waves goodbye to George.
scene_heading: 198	EXT. PLAINS UNDER SNOW - SERIES OF ANGLES
text: Winter has come. Snow falls across the breadth of the plains, on the river and the dark sleeping fields.
speaker_heading: 199	EXT. SLEIGH (OR ICE BOAT) - SNOW
text: Chuck and Abby skim over the snow in a gaily painted sleigh (or ice boat). She is wrapped up snug in a buffalo robe, her feet on a hot brick. Pigs forage along the fences.
speaker_heading: 200	INT. CAVE
text: They inspect a cave with a kerosene lantern. Blocks of ice, covered with burlap and sawdust, cool shelves of preserves.
text: Abby drops a stone into a dark pit. Two seconds pass before it hits the bottom.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Probably that's the first noise down there for thousands of years.
text: She speaks as though she had done it a favor. He puts his hand on hers. She presses it against her chest.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: You ever wish you could turn your heart off for a second and
dialog: see what happened?
speaker_heading: 201	OTHER ANGLES
text: Views of backlit gems, stalactites, salamanders in their cold dark pools, hidden springs and other mysteries of nature.
speaker_heading: ABBY (o.s.)
dialog: Maybe nothing would.
text: They round a corner and come upon an underground waterfall. It flows out of darkness back into darkness.
speaker_heading: 202	INT. FORGE
text: Bill, meanwhile, stands in a line of panting, sweating IMMIGRANTS.
text: On their shoulders they carry the huge barrel of a cannon. With a grunt they drive it into the fiery mouth of a forge.
speaker_heading: 203	EXT. CITY STREET
text: Bill stands on the corner of a big city street, stamping his feet against the cold. He tries to catch a pigeon with some bread crumbs under a box propped up by a stick, but just as he pulls the string to drop the trap it darts
dialog: out of the way.
speaker_heading: 204	BILL AND YOUNG GIRL
text: Bill has an improvised conversation with a YOUNG GIRL who has run away from home. He asks her where she comes from, whom she belongs to, etc. She tells him of her hopes, then passes on. Bill gives her all the money in his pocket.
speaker_heading: 205	MONTAGE
dialog: Enthralled, Abby surveys the wonders of Babylon and
dialog: Nineveh in a book about the Near East.
text: Ursula sits with a world globe, taking a geography lesson from a traveling TUTOR. No doubt this was Abby's idea.
text: Abby copies from a small plaster model of a Roman bust. She wants painfully to improve herself.
speaker_heading: 206	EXT. FROZEN LAKE -NIGHT
text: Abby and Chuck skate around a bonfire on a frozen prairie lake, carrying torches to guide them through the dark.
speaker_heading: 207	INT. CHICAGO FLOPHOUSE
text: Bill sits in a cold flophouse trying to write a letter. After a moment he wads it up and throws it away.
speaker_heading: 208	EXT. BELVEDERE
text: Abby, Ursula and Chuck are on a walk outside the Belvedere. The snow is gone. Abby's hands are stuffed in a chinchilla muff.
text: All at once they hear a distant noise like the whoops of an Indian war party. It seems mysteriously to come from every hilltop. Abby turns to Chuck with a puzzled look.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Prairie chickens. That means winter's broken.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Really? Where are they?
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: You hardly ever see them.
text: They stand and listen to the birds. There is a sense of the earth stirring back to life. Abby breathes in with a wild joy and hugs Chuck tightly by the waist.
speaker_heading: 209	EXT. TENEMENT HALLWAY
text: Bill is talking with a FRIEND in the hallway of a tenement.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I can't seem to get my mind on anything. I thought, when I came
dialog: off that place, boy, they'd better get all the women out of town that day, you know? Somewhere safe. But you know what I do? I sleep, nothing but
dialog: sleep.
text: A PANHANDLER approaches them with a hard-luck story.
speaker_heading: FRIEND
dialog: Okay, here's a quarter, but give me some entertainment, okay?
dialog: Not this old song and dance.
dialog: While the Panhandler performs, Bill looks around.
text: Two POLICEMEN have appeared in the entryway talking with the LANDLADY. Bill edges out the back door and down the steps, as though they might be after him.
text: He walks briskly down the alley without looking back.
speaker_heading: 210	TIGHT ON CHUCK (DISSOLVE TO DIARY)
text: Chuck holds a handful of seed under his nose. His heart stirs at the dark, mellow smell.
text: Into this dissolves an image of Abby writing in her diary.
speaker_heading: 211	EXT. FIELD
text: Chuck swings a barometer round and round, checking the weather. Two Case tractors pitch across a field like boats on a rolling sea. Long plumes of smoke wind off behind them. Each tows a fourteen-gang plow. A third
text: tractor follows, putting in the seed.
text: Ursula chases a flock of blackbirds off with a big rattle.
dialog: Every acre of ground for as far as the eye can see is under cultivation.
speaker_heading: ABBY (o.s.)
dialog: They put in the wheat the other day. This will be the biggest
dialog: year ever. There was a scare
dialog: when a locust turned up. Luckily it wasn't the bad kind.
speaker_heading: 212	NEW ANGLE
text: The plows have turned up a hibernating locust. Chuck stands by the tractor, inspecting it under a magnifying glass. The creature nestles like a fossil in the black earth.
speaker_heading: ABBY (o.s.)
dialog: They sleep in the ground for seventeen years, then crawl up
dialog: around the end of May and spend a week flying around before they die.
text: Chuck kicks up the dirt around the plow, looking for others. Benson, back from exile, looks concerned.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Nothing to worry about. Just shows the land is good.
speaker_heading: 213	SERIES OF ANGLES
text: Various wonders of the prairie: a charred tree, a huge mastodon bone, a flowering bush, a pelican, the rusted hulk of an ancient machine, etc.
speaker_heading: ABBY (o.s.)
dialog: How strange this new world is! You walk out in the morning
dialog: sometimes to find a lake rippling where the day before solid land
dialog: was.
speaker_heading: 214	EXT. STONE BOAT
text: Chuck has laid out the outline of a 50-foot boat in whitewashed stones. He walks around the imaginary deck showing Abby where the cabins will be.
speaker_heading: ABBY (o.s.)
dialog: Chuck wants to build a boat and take us off to Java, which he's
dialog: never seen.
speaker_heading: 215	EXT. FIELDS
dialog: Ursula goes out to the fields with an organist named JOEY
dialog: whom Chuck has hired to play for the crops. He and Ursula
dialog: seem to hit it off.
speaker_heading: ABBY (o.s.)
dialog: Last month he brought in a kid to play the organ. He claims it
dialog: helps the crops grow. Personally I doubt it.
speaker_heading: 216	EXT. MIDDLE OF FIELDS
text: They have brought an organ out into the middle of the fields. Ursula pumps up the bellows. Joey sits in front of the keyboard and shoots his cuffs.
dialog: His fingers strike the keys.
speaker_heading: 217	CLOUDS, CLOSEUPS OF PLANTS - TIME LAPSE PHOTOGRAPHY (STOCK)
text: Clouds build in huge toadstools. Thunder rolls across the
text: plains. A rain begins to fall. The music seems to work a magic on the crops, to draw them forth. The seeds germinate in the darkness of the
dialog: soil. Water finds its way down. Roots, tiny hairs at
dialog: first, spread and grow.
text: 218	DOLLS, TIGHT ANGLES ON THEIR FACES
text: Rude dolls fixed at the ends of pointed sticks--agricultural fetishes that Chuck's father brought with him from the Old World--stand around the field to join in aiding the crops.
speaker_heading: 219	EXT. BELVEDERE
text: Flags and bunting adorn the porch for Independence Day. Ursula sets off some fireworks.
speaker_heading: ABBY (o.s.)
text: Time has flown, and once again harvest is near.
speaker_heading: 220	EXT. GREEN FIELDS(TRIFFIDS)
text: The bald earth has, as though by a mystery, become a sheet of grain, its green already fading to gold. The music dies away, replaced by the whirr of summer crickets.
speaker_heading: ABBY (o.s.)
dialog: It will be a year that we have been here.
text: The camera holds and holds on the fields until in their vacant depths, we begin to sense the presence of a deep malevolence, still biding its time but growing every minute.
text: Seagulls--like strange emissaries from another world--glide back and forth over the fields in search of grasshoppers.
speaker_heading: 221	INT. LANTERN - NIGHT
text: Ursula takes curling irons from the chimney of a lantern where she has set them to heat, and applies them to Abby hair.
speaker_heading: URSULA
dialog: Suppose I never fall in love, Abby?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Don't be silly. Everybody does. What do you think all those songs
dialog: are about? You need to be careful, though, and not throw it away.
speaker_heading: URSULA
dialog: Throw what away?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: You know, your chances. It's too hard to explain to a little
dialog: squirrel like you.
speaker_heading: URSULA
dialog: That sounded just like Bill. Don't you miss him?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Sometimes.
dialog: From her tone, however, we sense that she finds it easier with him gone.
speaker_heading: 222	INT. MASTER BEDROOM
dialog: Abby whispers something to Chuck in bed that evening.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: You ever said that to anybody else?
dialog: She giggles.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: You're lying, aren't you? Well, go right on lying.
text: The camera moves to the window, beneath the eave. Outside, peacocks strut back and forth.
speaker_heading: 223	EXT. MUDDY ROAD
text: Bill rides an Indian motorcycle along a muddy road back to the bonanza. His rabbit is strapped to the back. He stops for a moment to look at the new fields.
speaker_heading: 224	EXT. BELVEDERE - BILL'S POV
text: Abby sings to herself as she beats out a carpet. Bill appears on the ridge behind her. Hope leaves him like a ghost. She looks happily settled into a new life with Chuck. All at once she turns around.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Bill!
text: She rushes up and embraces him, but her warmth just seems a tease to Bill. She is different. She looks different. The tutors and tailors Chuck has brought in over the winter have given her more polish. Her hair is nicely
text: coiffed. Where she used to dress in cotton shirtwaists, she wears crinolines now.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: How's everybody been?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Including me? Okay. Gee, you look good.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Thanks. And Chuck?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Still the same.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Actually I didn't mean it that way.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I came back to help out with the harvest.
text: He feels humiliated at not having a stronger excuse. But he loves her. He aches with love. He hoped their last fight was just another storm in the romance. Evidently it was more.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I thought about you a lot. Wrote you a letter, but it was no good, so I tore it up.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: How'd you come?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Train.
dialog: He looks her up and down.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Nice dress.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: I'm glad you like it.
text: He admires her garden. His familiar cockiness vanishes as little by little he sees the old feeling is not there.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: This is new, too.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: The daffodils were already here, but I put in the rest. You
dialog: really do like them?
text: At a shriek from Ursula, Bill turns around. She runs into his arms, and covers him with kisses.
speaker_heading: URSULA
dialog: I've missed you! I thought about you every day. You should've written. Did Abby show you what she got?
text: Abby scowls at Ursula. With no choice but to show him, she opens the top button of her blouse and draws out a diamond necklace.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: (apologetically)
dialog: For Christmas.
speaker_heading: URSULA
dialog: Plus a music box. He spoils her. Why don't they spoil me, too?
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: You oughta be glad you didn't have to spend the winter. You
dialog: would've gone crazy.

text: The winter's peace is gone. Abby is sick with fear. Now that she loves Chuck, too, she can never again be honest with Bill. The truth of her feelings would crush him. Moreover, there's no telling how he might react. He could ruin everything, even get them killed.
speaker_heading: 226	EXT. BEDROOM WINDOW
text: Chuck looks on from behind the bedroom window.
speaker_heading: 227	EXT. DINNER TABLE
text: They dine in awkward silence. Benson has joined them.
text: Abby, for all her winter's polish, still eats with the back of her knife.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: How was Chicago?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Great.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: How's everybody doing?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Okay.
text: They are silent for a moment. Bill senses that nobody except Ursula is really glad to see him back.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: How's Blackie?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Still hasn't wised up. Know what I mean? He asked how you were
dialog: doing, though.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I told him. Ran into Sam, too. He'd been in a fight.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Oh yeah?
text: Bill can see that her interest is only polite. He knows that he should turn around and leave, but he cannot. The sight of him with his confidence gone is painful to behold.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: His nose was like this.
text: He pushes his nose to one side. Ursula and Abby laugh.
speaker_heading: 228	EXT. STOCK POND
text: Bill plants willow slips in the soft earth by the stock pond. Ursula orders a dog around.
speaker_heading: URSULA
dialog: Look at this dog mind me. Sit! You've got to say it like hitting a nail.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Has she asked you anything about me?
speaker_heading: URSULA
dialog: No.
text: Ursula flirts with him, running the shoots along his back.
text: She waits to see what he will do. He gets up and after a short chase catches her. He holds her at arm's length for a moment, then kisses her.
speaker_heading: URSULA
dialog: What'd you do that for?
dialog: Bill wonders himself. To get revenge on Abby? He touches her breast.
speaker_heading: URSULA
dialog: Don't.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: URSULA
dialog: Cause there's nothing there.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I can be the judge of that.
speaker_heading: URSULA
dialog: Then ask first.
dialog: He kisses her neck.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Nobody has to know but us chickens.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: What do I have to say to convince you? You tell me, I'll say it.
speaker_heading: URSULA
dialog: What makes you think I would?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Nothing.
text: She giggles and kisses him back. But guilt has caught up with him. He cannot go ahead.
speaker_heading: URSULA
dialog: What's the matter?
dialog: No reply.
speaker_heading: URSULA
dialog: Maybe it would be wrong.
dialog: (disappointed)
dialog: You still love her, don't you?
text: Bill hums a rock off toward the horizon.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I should've gone in the church, like my father was after me to.
speaker_heading: 229	BILL'S POV - OUTSIDE THE BELVEDERE - NIGHT
text: Chuck and Abby sit in their cozy living room playing Parcheesi. The sound of their voices is muffled. The camera draws back to reveal Bill outside the window, watching.
text: She is comfortable with Chuck now. Apparently, he has lost his place in her heart. He wants to rush in and drag her away.
speaker_heading: 230	EXT. BEDROOM WINDOW - NIGHT
text: Later that night he stands under the bedroom window and wonders at the meaning of the shadows that flicker across the ceiling. After a moment he withdraws into the darkness.
speaker_heading: 231	EXT. SMALL PRAIRIE TOWN (DUCK LAKE)
text: Bill has brought Abby into a nearby town to make some purchases. Dressed in a chauffeur's gown and goggles, he sits against the fender of the Overland watching her move from store to store. Ursula is with her.
text: The TOWNSPEOPLE all speak German. Their peasant costumes are freely mixed with Western dress. The signs are old German script. Two MEN carry a huge bulb through the street, to put atop a church.
speaker_heading: 232	OVERLAND AUTO
dialog: Abby walks up with Ursula.
speaker_heading: URSULA
dialog: Listen, I'm going to stay and go back with the laundry wagon.
text: Abby looks at Bill, then nods okay. Ursula runs off. Bill opens the door, and she gets in.
speaker_heading: 233	EXT. ROAD OUTSIDE TOWN (DUCK LAKE)
text: They are stopped on the road a hundred yards outside the town.
dialog: Abby smokes as Bill checks the radiator. Something in his behavior leads us to suspect he may have staged this stop.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: How you been doing?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Me? Fine.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: We don't talk so much these days.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: I know.
dialog: She knows what he wants. She cannot give it anymore.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I said a lot of stupid things before I went off.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: (politely)
dialog: I forgot about it already.
dialog: Bill, trying his best to make peace with her, cannot help seeing that she would like to keep things as they are--and not because she harbors any grudge.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: You've forgiven me?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: There was nothing to forgive.
text: He holds a bottle of liquor out to her.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: What're you worried about?
text: She takes a swig. He laughs. She laughs back.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: So how'm I doing with you?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Fine.
text: He takes her hand and holds it like a trapped bird.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: What's happened?
text: She shrugs, disengaging her hand to brush aside her hair. She is painfully aware of his suffering but doesn't have the heart to tell him how it all is.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I probably ought to leave. I will.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Already? You just got here.
text: She hasn't really contradicted him. He leans forward as though to kiss her. She lets him. She wishes that she could give herself to him, but she doesn't know what is right. Then, a sudden impulse of panic, she gets up and backs away.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Where you going?
text: He reaches out to catch her. She breaks away and starts to run. He walks quickly after her, cutting off any escape toward the town.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Why'd you have to come back?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I'm not going to hurt you. I only want to talk with you.
text: She stops and hides her face in her hands. He gently pulls them away.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I didn't come back to make trouble for you. I guess we were fooling
dialog: each other to think it could last. I mean, What was I offering youanyhow? A ride to the bottom. Looking at you now, in the right clothes and everything, I see how crazy I was and--well, I understand. It's okay. I sort of cut my own throat, actually.
text: Her eyes close and her legs give in. Bill lets her go and backs off a step in surprise. She sinks to the ground, as though in a trance.
speaker_heading: 234	TIGHT ON BILL
text: Bill, taken by surprise, goes up and kneels down beside her. He looks to see that she is okay. He picks a fox-tail out of her hair. Her dress has worked up toward her knees. He pulls it back down. He wants to caress
dialog: her face but hesitates.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: How'd we let it happen, Abby? We were so happy once. Why didn't we starve? I love you so much. What have1 done? You're so beautiful. What have I done?
text: He touches his lips for a fraction of a second to hers, notices another car approaching down the road. He picks her up like a doll and carries her back to the Overland.
speaker_heading: 235	EXT. BELVEDERE - CHUCK'S POV
dialog: They have arrived back at the Belvedere.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: I'm sorry.
text: She touches his face in a surge of sympathy. What has she done to him? He kisses her neck and leads her toward the front door.
speaker_heading: 236	CRANE TO CHUCK
text: The camera rises to the uppermost story of the Belvedere. Chuck has seen them. Hot tears leap to his eyes. Before Bill left for the winter he often observed such intimacies between them. Now it all looks different.
speaker_heading: 237	CHUCK'S POVS (HIGH ANGLES)
text: He looks around at his estate--his barn, his auto, his great house and his granary. None of them is any consolation now. Far a moment it seems to him as though he lived here in some time long past.
speaker_heading: 238	INT. BEDROOM
text: Abby notices Chuck watching her outside the bedroom door.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: You want something from me?
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Will you hand me that magazine?
dialog: He gives her the magazine she wants.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: What's the matter?
text: He seems for a moment to consider telling her, then shrugs and goes downstairs.
speaker_heading: 239	INT. LIVING ROOM
text: He stumbles into a bird cage but hardly notices. The jostled birds raise a fuss.
speaker_heading: 240	EXT. FRONT PORCH
text: He runs into Bill on the front porch.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I've been looking for you. I have to take off again, real soon here, and...
text: Chuck puts a hand on Bill's shoulder, stopping him. They look at each other for a moment, then he passes on. Bill seems puzzled.
speaker_heading: 241	EXT. FIELDS
text: Chuck walks out into the deep of his fields. The wheat, a warm dry gold, is almost ready to take in. He sits down and rests his head against a
text: furrow, powerless to think. The wind makes a song in the infinitude of sweet clicking heads.
text: He puts his hands over his heart and breathes in gasps, with the dumb honesty of a wounded animal. He could not himself quite say what it is that he knows.
speaker_heading: 242	EXT. BONANZA - SERIES OF ANGLES
text: Late that afternoon disaster strikes as a swarm of locusts sweeps down on the bonanza. We do not see where they come from. They seem to appear out of nowhere, unnoticed. Ursula works in the kitchen, Bill by the barn. Chuck lies asleep in the field, Abby upstairs in bed.
speaker_heading: 243	ANIMALS ON BONANZA
text: The animals sense it first. The buffalo move off in a mass. The horses become uncontrollable. One runs around the barn in a panic. Bill watches it, puzzled.
dialog: Two peacocks have a fight.
text: A dog in the treadmill races in vain to escape, driving the machine to a feverish pitch. The shadow of a giant cloud licks over the hills.
speaker_heading: 244	EXT. FIELDS
dialog: Everything seems normal in the fields.
text: Then, as you listen, a strange new sound begins to rise from them, a wild sea-like singing. As the camera moves over the fields and down into the wheat it swells in a crescendo until...
speaker_heading: 245	TIGHT ON LOCUSTS
text: Suddenly we see them up close, devouring the stalks in a fever, the noise of their jaws magnified a thousand times.
text: They slip into the Belvedere, under the sash and wainscoting, turning up first in places it would seem they could never get into: a jewelry case, the back of a radio, the works of a music box, a bottle with a miniature ship inside, etc.
speaker_heading: 246	EXTREME CLOSEUPS
dialog: Their eyes are dumb and implacable. They seem to have a whole hidden life of their own.
speaker_heading: 247	INT. KITCHEN
text: Little by little they gather in numbers. Ursula first sees one on the drainboard. She swats it with a newspaper. Others sprout up. One by one she picks them up with a tongs and drops them into the stove. This method
text: is too slow. She begins to use her fingers. She moves with a quick, nervous energy, even as she understands this is futile. At last claustro-phobia seizes her. She spins around with a shriek, lashing out at everything in sight.
speaker_heading: 248	INT. MASTER BEDROOM
text: In the bedroom overhead, Abby wakes up from one nightmare into another. She jumps out of bed and goes to the window. The locusts pelt against the pane like shot. She throws the bolt. Suddenly a crack shoots through the glass. She jumps back and watches in horror as a sliver of the pane falls in. They are free to enter.
speaker_heading: 249	SERIES OF ANGLES
text: Suddenly they are everywhere: on the clothesline, in the pantry, in hats and shoes and the seams of clothing. Not a nook or cranny is safe from penetration.
speaker_heading: 250	TIGHT ON CHUCK - SLOW MOTION
text: Chuck, asleep in the deep of the wheat, bolts up in slow motion. His hair is seething with them.
speaker_heading: 251	EXT. BONANZA - FURTHER ANGLES
text: Panic hits the bonanza. Workers tie string around their pant cuffs to keep the insects from crawling up their legs, then rush out to the fields with gongs, rattles, pot lids, scarecrows on sticks, drums and horns and
dialog: other noisemakers to scare them off.
text: Some pray. Others run around like madmen, stamping and yelling, ignored by the gathering host. A couple get into a fistfight.
text: A storm flag is run up the flagpole. A tractor blasts out an S.O.S. The peacocks huddle under the stoop.
speaker_heading: 252	TIGHT ON CHUCK
dialog: Chuck gives Benson his orders.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Offer fifty cents a bushel for them. Get out the reapers.
dialog: See what you can harvest.
speaker_heading: 253	HIGH DOWN ANGLE
text: The locusts snap through the air. Bill, swatting at them with a shovel, stops to gag. One has flown into his mouth.
speaker_heading: 254	TIGHT ON GEARS
dialog: They jam up the gears of the machinery with the crush of their bodies.
speaker_heading: 255	INT. MASTER BEDROOM
text: Abby throws a sheet over herself, but they get in under it. She thrashes around madly, then with a cry goes limp.
speaker_heading: 256	CHUCK AND BENSON
text: Benson reports back to Chuck. A team of horses races by, nearly bowling them over.
speaker_heading: BENSON
dialog: We can't get the machines out. They're jamming up the gears.
dialog: There's a good chance they'll pass on south, though. Unless...
dialog: unless a wind comes up.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: What happens then?
speaker_heading: BENSON
dialog: They'll set down and walk in.
speaker_heading: 257	SIGNS OF DAMAGE
text: The locusts devour not just the crops but every organic thing: pitchfork handles, linens on the clothesline, leather traces, flowers in the window boxes, etc. Soon a large area of wheat is eaten down to stubble.
text: Bill looks away from a tree for a second. When he turns back it has been stripped to a wintry bareness.
speaker_heading: 258	EXT. WIND GENERATOR, OTHER ANGLES
text: The vanes of the wind generator begin gently to stir. Little by little the wind picks up. A dust devil spins across the yard. The grass lists by the well. A power line moans.
speaker_heading: 259	EXT. FIELDS
text: As the sun dips below the horizon, the locusts pour in like a living river, walking along the ground like a procession of Army ants. The roar of their wings is deafening. The air hisses and pops with their electric frenzy.
speaker_heading: 260	STOCK AND MATTE SHOTS - SUNSET
text: And these are but the advance elements of a main force which looms like a silver cloud on the horizon.
speaker_heading: 261	EXT. BONFIRE - NIGHT
text: WORKERS dump bushels of the insects into a bonfire. A MAN with an abacus keeps track of what each is owed.
speaker_heading: 262	SAME FIELDS - NIGHT
text: The wind has picked up. Chuck, Bill and Abby have come out to the fields with a dozen WORKERS to investigate the extent of the damage. The insects buzz around blindly in the light of their lanterns, which they carry Japanese-fashion at the ends of cane poles.
speaker_heading: 263	TIGHT ON CHUCK - NIGHT
dialog: Chuck inspects the grain.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: There's nothing we can do but wait. They're either going to take it all or they're not.
text: He covers his face with his hands. The others shy back at this display of grief, startling in one so formal. Their jostled lanterns cast a dance of lights.
text: Bill, moved to real sympathy, takes him by the shoulders.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Come on. They might still lift. Hey, I've seen a wind like this lay
dialog: down and die. Don't give up now.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: (ignoring him)
dialog: We could at least make sure they don't get the people on south.
text: He breaks open the mantle of his lantern, still unsure what he should do. Some of the flaming kerosene splashes onto the crops nearby, setting them ablaze. Bill drops his rattle and swats the fire out with his coat.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: What're you doing? Watch it! What're you, crazy? There's
dialog: still a chance, don't you see?
text: Chuck goes to his horse. Bill grabs him by the sleeve. Does he really mean to set the fields on fire? Chuck pushes him aside. Bill, frantic, turns to the others for support.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Stop him, or it's all going up.
dialog: They, however, are too uncertain of their ground to intervene. Chuck turns on Bill.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: What does it matter to you?
text: Chuck slings fire out of the broken lantern onto the crops next to Bill -- a sudden, hostile gesture that catches them all by surprise. Independent of his will, the truth is forcing its way up, like a great blind fish from the bottom of the sea.
text: He slings the fire out again. A patch lands on Bill's pantleg. Bill slaps it out.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: What's got into you?
text: They stare at each other. Bill backs off like a cat, sensing Chuck knows the truth, but at a loss to understand how he could.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Why do you care? I gave my life for this land.
text: Chuck walks towards him. Suddenly Bill turns and takes off running. Chuck swings at him with the lantern. Bill escapes behind the building wall of flame that springs up between them.
text: The whirr of the locusts stops for a moment--they seem at times to have a collective mind--then, just as mysteriously, resumes.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Stop, Chuck!
text: Chuck leaps on his horse. She tries to drag him off but is thrown aside and almost trampled underfoot. Now the others join in, trying to knock away the lantern or catch his stirrup. He eludes them and rides off after Bill, leaving a slash of flame behind him in the grain. They tear off their coats to swat it out, in vain--already it stretches a hundred yards.
speaker_heading: 264	BILL
text: Bill runs through the night, still carrying his lantern. Chuck bears down on him. Abby chases along behind him, screaming for him to stop.
text: Bill realizes the lantern is giving his position away He blows it out and vanishes from sight. All we can see is the thundering horseman, sowing fire.
speaker_heading: 265	CRANE SHOT
text: With a rough idea where Bill is, Chuck begins to lay a ring of fire around him, fifty yards in diameter.
speaker_heading: 266	BILL AND ABBY INSIDE RING
text: Abby spots Bill against the flames. She rushes up, gasping. They have been caught inside the ring.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: What're you doing? This is a bad place to talk
text: He throws his coat over Abby's head, picks her up by the waist and crashes through the flame. They have to shout to make themselves understood. The locusts roar like a cyclone.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Did you see that? He was trying to burn me. What's got into him?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: He knows. He must.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: A whole year's work. All wasted! These bugs, once they make up
dialog: their minds...
text: Bill stalls. The fire races toward them through the wheat. They appear as silhouettes against it.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I need to get out of here. I think you probably should, too.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Hell of a life. Damned if you do and damned if you don't.
text: He leaves. Abby wonders if she ought to run after him.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Bill!
text: But this moment's hesitation has been too long. Already he is swallowed up in the night, her voice swept away in the roar of the flame and the locusts, who seem to wail louder now, and with a great mournfulness--like keening Arab women--as if they knew the fate shortly to envelop
dialog: them.
text: Abby turns back. She, too, has reason to fear Chuck and must escape.
speaker_heading: 267	NEW ANGLE
dialog: Benson rallies the workers.
speaker_heading: BENSON
dialog: There's still a chance they're going to fly.
speaker_heading: VOICES
dialog: Get the tractor out! The pump wagon! Blankets!
dialog: They rush off to find equipment to fight the fire.
speaker_heading: 268	ISOLATED ON CHUCK - NIGHT
text: Chuck rides through the dark like a lone Horseman of the Apocalypse, setting his fields on fire.
scene_heading: 269	EXT. PLAINS ON FIRE - SERIES OF ANGLES - NIGHT
text: Tractors attempt to plow a firebreak. Mad silhouettes run back and forth, slapping at the blaze with wet gunny sacks fixed to the ends of sticks. Two dormitories burn out of control.
text: Ursula throws open the barn and lets the horses out. They have raised thunder kicking at their stalls. The light above the barn door pulses erratically.
speaker_heading: 270	EXPLOSIONS - NIGHT (MINIATURES)
text: Oil wells explode along the horizon. Huge balls of flames roll into the heavens.
speaker_heading: 271	EXT. BURNING PLAINS - NIGHT
text: Panic spreads among the workers as the holocaust threatens to engulf them. They throw down their tools and run for their lives.
speaker_heading: 272	ANIMALS - NIGHT
text: Animals flee in all directions: birds and deer and rabbits, pigs, buffalo and the horses from the barn. The locusts mill around crazily on the wheat stalks, backlit against the flame.
speaker_heading: 273	BILL - NIGHT
text: Bill, fleeing on his motorbike with his rabbit, holds up
dialog: for a moment to watch the fire--a Biblical inferno of spectacular sweep.
scene_heading: 274	EXT. BEDROOM WINDOW--TRACKING SHOT (CHUCK'S POV)--NIGHT
text: A single light burns in the Belvedere.
speaker_heading: 275	INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Heaving with sobs, Abby throws her things into a bindle. She has lost Chuck forever. Their life is destroyed. She glances out the window. She still has time to get away, but she must hurry. She bolts for the door. Sud-
text: denly Chuck steps from the shadows, blocking her exit.
text: His face, black with soot, looks gruesome in the gas1ight. The locusts have chewed up his clothes.
dialog: Abby is like a frightened deer. Did he see her packing?
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: You look as though you'd seen a ghost.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Where you going?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Off with him?
text: The wind cuts gaps in the death wail of the locusts. From time to time we hear the thump of an exploding well.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: He's not your brother, is he?
dialog: How much does he know? She edges toward the door.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Why do you say that?
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Come here a minute. Who are you?
dialog: (no reply)
dialog: Where'd you come from?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: I told you.
text: He shakes her. She quivers like a child in his grasp. She no longer has the audacity to lie.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: How long have you known?
text: He drops his eyes. Shamefully long -- and his anger is partly just at this.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: What'd you want? He punches in the shade of a lamp, extinguishing it.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
text: Tell me. He shoves over the chest of drawers. She does not move.
text: He tears down the drapes, already in shreds.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: This? Show me what you wanted! I would have given it all to you.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Please, Chuck.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Please what? You're not going to tell me you're sorry, I hope..
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: But I am.
text: Outside the window fires rage along half the horizon. He sits down. He wants to sob, but cannot.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: You're so wonderful. How could you do this?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: I'm just no good. You picked me from the gutter, and this is
dialog: how -- I never deserved you.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: The things you told me.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: I love you, though. You have to believe me. It may sound false after...
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Down at the cave. Don't you remember? I believed them.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: All right. I'm going away. You'll never have to see me again.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Away?
text: He gets up, suddenly alarmed, walks to the mantel and opens a chest.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: What're you doing?
text: Chuck drapes his neck with the stole he used in slaughtering the hog. Her face goes empty. He gets his razor strop from the shaving basin. She shrinks back in the corner. He looks at her for a moment, then leaves the room.
speaker_heading: 276	INT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT
text: Abby pursues him down the stairs. He throws her aside.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Where are you doing? Chuck! What are you doing? I won't
dialog: let you! Come back!
text: Again he throws her aside, and again she keeps after him, desperate to prevent any harm coming to Bill. Finally he picks her up and drags her outside.
speaker_heading: 277	EXT. PORCH - NIGHT
text: He lashes her with a rope to a column of the porch. She struggles vainly to free herself. Does he intend to use the razor on her?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: No, Chuck! Please, darling! It wasn't his fault. It was mine.
dialog: Let him go. I love you, Chuck. Do anything, only please...
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: I'm sick of hearing lies.

speaker_heading: 278	TIGHT ON CHUCK - NIGHT
text: Chuck wanders through the night with a lantern, calling his mare.
speaker_heading: 279	EXT. BURNT-OUT FIELDS - DAWN
text: Dawn breaks. Chuck rides over the burnt-out fields looking for Bill. The feet of his lank white mare are wrapped to the fetlock in wet burlap, to protect them from the smouldering grass. It prances warily along, without
text: making a sound, wreathed in a mist of blue smoke. With him he carries a stool. The camera pans up to the smoke which is carrying his fortune off.
speaker_heading: 280	CHUCK'S POVS
text: Burnt, blind deer stand and look at him in utter terror, as though they understood his intentions. The roasted corpses of sharptail grouse, coyotes and badgers lie scattered here and there. Piles of dung burn on after the grass is out.
text: A peacock from the Belvedere wanders around, angry and
dialog: perplexed.
speaker_heading: 281	BILL
text: Bill is repairing his motorbike by a rock in the middle of the scorched landscape. The tires are soft as licorice from the heat. Suddenly, he looks up. Chuck has found him.
text: He jumps behind the handlebars and fishtails off. Chuck breaks into a gallop, rides him down, knocks him to the ground with the stool, dismounts and stamps in the spokes of the front wheel to make sure he goes no further.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Who do you think you are? Now you've ruined it. What's got
dialog: into you?
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Where you headed?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Why do I have to tell you? I can come and go when I like.
dialog: This is still a free country, last I heard.
text: Bill stops when he sees the stool. Chuck calmly strops the razor on his stirrup flap. There are no secrets now.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: What can I say? Too late for apologies. You've got a right
dialog: to hate me.
text: Chuck puts the razor away and advances on Bill with the stool.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I want to leave. You won't ever see me again. I already got what
dialog: I deserve.
text: There is nothing Bill can say to appease him. This will be a fight to the death. Chuck lashes out with the stool. Bill ducks too late.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Watch it!
text: Chuck comes at him again. Bill throws a punch, but Chuck blocks it and knocks him down again with the stool.
text: Bill reels back and cracks his head on the bicycle frame. This time he stays down. Satisfied the struggle is over, Chuck goes back to get some rope.
speaker_heading: 282	NEW ANGLE
text: Chuck shuts his eyes to mumble a prayer of absolution--in Russian.
text: Bill in a panic, snaps a spoke out of the broken wheel and lays it against his sleeve.
text: Chuck moves in for the kill. Bill gets to his feet. He wants to run but fear makes his knees like water. Suddenly, they are face to face. Chuck swings at Bill with the stool but misses. Bill lifts the spoke above him and
dialog: drives it deep into Chuck's heart.
text: Chuck gasps. Bill seems just as shocked. Chuck sits down to determine the gravity of his injury. Blood jets rhythmically out the end of the spoke, as though from a straw. Bill circles him, unbelieving.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Should I pull it out?
text: Chuck puts his finger over the end of the spoke. Blood seeps out the side of his mouth, like sap from a broken stem.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I better get somebody.
text: He tries to catch the reins of Chuck's horse, but it shies out of reach, its conscience repelled. He looks back at Chuck in anguish. What has he done?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: You were my friend.
speaker_heading: 283	TIGHT ON BILL AND HIS POVS
text: The Belvedere is visible on the horizon. Bill hesitates
text: a moment, then heads back on foot to find Abby. He gives
dialog: Chuck a wide berth.
text: Then, on a ridge in the distance, he spots Benson.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Get a doctor! Fast!
dialog: How much did he see? Bill does not stay to find out but
dialog: takes off running, though not without first collecting his
dialog: rabbit.
text: Benson, meanwhile, bounds down the hill to Chuck's side.
text: His left sleeve has been burned away. The flesh beneath
dialog: is the color of a raw steak.
speaker_heading: 284	CHUCK'S POVS
dialog: Chuck sees the smoke from his fields, the burnt deer,
dialog: a circling hawk.
speaker_heading: 285	TIGHT ON CHUCK
text: He breathes in gulps. His eyes are blank, like a child's
dialog: marbles. He takes Benson's hand.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: (weakly)
dialog: Wasn't his fault. Tell her...forgive them.
dialog: The locusts can be heard no more. The prairie makes a
text: sound like the ocean. Chuck turns his back and dies.
speaker_heading: 286	TIGHT ON BENSON
dialog: Benson weeps. Whether or not he understood Chuck's last
dialog: wishes, he seems unlikely to abide by them.
speaker_heading: 287	EXT. BELVEDERE
dialog: Bill finds Abby bound to the house like the figurehead
text: of a ship. He cuts her loose. The ropes fall at her feet. She is free.
dialog: They look at each other for a moment.
text: Then, in a rush of compassion for them all, she throws
dialog: her arms around him.
dialog: Bill wonders if she is taking him back. Might their
dialog: differences all have been a terrible misunderstanding?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: We have to hurry. Chuck's out looking right now. Oh, Bill,
dialog: what have we done? He took his razor. We need to hurry. He
dialog: might be coming back any minute.
dialog: Bill mentions nothing of his encounter. She grabs her
dialog: bindle, Bill a handful of silverware and an umbrella.
text: After a moment's hesitation, he puts them back.
speaker_heading: 288	NEW ANGLE
dialog: They run down to the barn, where the cars are stored.
dialog: The saplings in the front yard have been stripped even
dialog: of their bark. Abby stops to look back at the Belvedere
dialog: one last time. Chuck does not want her anymore. How
dialog: could she expect him to?
text: Bill grabs her by the hand and tugs her along.
speaker_heading: 289	EXT. BARN
text: Abby throws open the doors of the barn. Bill cranks up
dialog: the engine of the Overland.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Will the cops be looking for us, too?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Probably.
text: Abby stands in the door. She is reluctant to leave, though she
dialog: knows they must.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Get in.
text: She notices that Bill's lip is cut, his shirt soaked with
dialog: blood.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: What happened to you? Where's this from?
dialog: Bill looks down. He forgot.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Had an accident.
text: She looks at him for a moment, not quite trusting this
dialog: explanation. The engine catches with a noise like start-
text: led poultry. Bill gets behind the wheel. Just as they
dialog: are pulling out of the garage, Ursula runs up, black
dialog: as coal from battling the fire all night.
speaker_heading: URSULA
dialog: Where you going?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (breathless)
dialog: We got in a jam. You'll be safer here. Say we're headed for town.
dialog: Take care of the rabbit, too. He's yours now.
speaker_heading: URSULA
dialog: What's the matter?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Just do what I say. Why're you always arguing about everything?
dialog: Wait here till we get in touch.
text: Bill gives Ursula his wallet and a kiss. Abby gives her a hug.
speaker_heading: 290	EXT. BURNT GRASS
text: They roar off through the burnt grass of the prairie.
dialog: Abby waves goodbye.
speaker_heading: 291	THEIR POV (MOVING)
text: As they crest a ridge, Benson appears in front of them,
text: waving a hand to flag them down. Bill puts his foot on
dialog: the gas. Benson sees they are not going to stop and fires
text: at then with a pistol. Bill grabs a shotgun from a scab-
text: bard under the dash and fires back. Nobody is hurt.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: What's the matter with him?
text: Bill shrugs. Inside he feels a great relief. They are
text: free at last. At last he has her back.
speaker_heading: 292	EXT. BONANZA GATES
dialog: They veer off across the prairie, towards the Razumihin
dialog: gates. The music comes up full.
speaker_heading: 293	EXT. SHACK ON RIVER
text: They have come to a lone shack on the river, a drinking
dialog: house for passing boatmen. They negotiate (in pantomime)
text: with the PROPRIETOR for a tiny steam boat moored at the
dialog: end of the pier. When the car is not enough, Abby throws
dialog: in her necklace.
speaker_heading: 294	ABOARD THE BOAT
text: They board the boat and turn down stream. There is a phonograph
dialog: on board.
speaker_heading: 295	TIGHT ON NECKLACE
text: The necklace sparkles on the hood of the car--a hint
dialog: they are leaving behind evidence that could betray them.
scene_heading: 296	EXT. BOAT ON RIVER - AND MOVING POVS
text: They glide along in the hush of evening. The reeds are
dialog: full of deer. Cranes, imprudently tame, dance on the
dialog: sand bars.
dialog: Bill looks around in wonder. He knows these may be his
dialog: last days on earth. Abby throws a sounding line.
dialog: A COUPLE from a local farm seeks privacy in the willows.
text: Other BOATMEN glide past in silence. A CHILD plays a
text: fiddle on the deck of a scow. HUNTERS creep along the
dialog: shore in search of waterfowl.
speaker_heading: 297	EXT. CAMP - DUSK
text: Bill sleeps under a tarp. Abby looks out across the water
text: and bursts into sobs. She has wronged Chuck and thrown
dialog: her life away.
speaker_heading: 298	THEIR POVS (MOVING) - NIGHT
text: They shine a lamp into the murky depths and spear pickerel
dialog: with a hammered-out fork.
dialog: Strange rocks loom up and give way to wide moonlit fields.
dialog: They have the sense of entering places where nobody has
dialog: been since the making of the world.
speaker_heading: 299	EXT. FARMHOUSE
text: Four LAWMEN, in pursuit, interrogate some FARMERS. Have
dialog: they seen the two people standing by Chuck in his wedding
dialog: portrait? Benson holds the bulky frame. There is a funereal
dialog: border of black crepe at the corners.
speaker_heading: 300	EXT. ABOARD THE BOAT - DUSK
text: They drift idly on the flood. The phonograph is playing
text: in the stern. Abby is back in trousers. Bill points to
text: a white house on the shore, an image of comfort and peace.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I used to want a set-up like that. Something like that, I thought,
dialog: and you'd really have it made. Now I don't care. I just wish
dialog: we could always live this way.
dialog: He sees that her mind is somewhere else. He wants to tell
dialog: her the truth about Chuck, for intimacy's sake, but it
dialog: would just put more of a cloud over everything. It might
dialog: even cause her to hate him.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Maybe you want to write him a letter.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: I hadn't thought of that.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: You really do love him, don't you?
dialog: She does not reply.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: You want to go back?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: (shaking her head)
dialog: Too late for that. I could never face him again.
text: They look at each other for a moment. He touches her face,
dialog: to show that he does not hold it against her. She touches
dialog: him back. They only have each other now. They must save
dialog: what moments they can.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Guess it's you and me again.
speaker_heading: 301	NEW ANGLE
text: On a sudden whim, Abby takes off her wedding bracelet
dialog: and holds it over the water.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Watch this.
text: Bill is caught off guard. Before he can make a move she
text: throws it far out into the river. They laugh, without
dialog: knowing why, at this extravagance.
scene_heading: 302	EXT. SHORE .. TRACKING SHOTS
dialog: They gather May apples and black haws. The music from
dialog: the phonograph comes up full.
dialog: They dig clams from a sand bar in a playful way. We are
dialog: reminded of their first days on the harvest.
speaker_heading: 303	XT. UNDERGROWTH
dialog: They make love in the undergrowth.
text: Abby, afterwards, lies in a naked daze. The damp greens
dialog: of the wilderness envelop her.
speaker_heading: 304	THEIR POV - ON CITY ON RIVER - NIGHT
dialog: Rounding a bend in the river that night, they come upon
dialog: the lights of a great city. They have doused the running
text: lamp. Except for a faint groaning of the trees along the
text: shore, the river is silent, conveying the sounds of the
dialog: city to them from across a great distance -- bells, joy-
dialog: ful voices, horns, the chirping of brakes, etc.
scene_heading: 305	EXT. CITY STREETS AND THEIR POVS - NIGHT
dialog: They sneak down an alley.
dialog: There are signs of life behind a few windows, but the
dialog: city pursues its gaiety elsewhere.
text: Suddenly, they come upon a POLICEMAN making his rounds.
text: They let him pass, then cut through a vacant lot back
dialog: to the boat.
speaker_heading: 306	EXT. RIVER FRONT - DAY
text: The next morning finds them camped in a thicket on the river
dialog: front below a factory.
text: Bill wakes up, mysteriously happy. Their blankets are heavy
dialog: with dew. Overhead, finches tilt from branch to branch. A
dialog: light wind rushes through the leaves. Whatever his trou-
dialog: bles, they seem very small to him in the great. scheme of
dialog: things.
text: He looks at Abby, mouthing silent words in her sleep.
text: He puts on a white scarf and starts down to the boat. The
text: slope is strewn with sodden cartons, burnt bricks and burst
dialog: mattresses, an avalanche of urban excreta.
speaker_heading: 307	HIS POV
text: Abruptly he stops. Two POLICE OFFICERS are combing over the
text: boat. They have not seen him. He edges back. Suddenly, there is yelling on the hill above them. Bill looks up. Benson is calling him to the attention of a car-load of POLICEMEN pulling up beside him. The Officers at the boat now spot him, too, and open fire. Bill darts like
dialog: a rabbit into the thicket.
speaker_heading: 308	TIGHT ON ABBY
text: Abby bolts awake. Bill jumps down beside her, breathless,
text: and begins looking frantically for the shells to his shotgun.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: What's going on?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Keep down. Can't explain now. They're here.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Who? What're you talking about? Stop a minute.
text: He covers her with his body as bullets zoom through the
text: undergrowth. His face is close to hers. She bursts into
dialog: tears.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Don't get shot. Look for me under that next bridge down.
dialog: After dark.
dialog: He empties out the contents of his pockets -- a watch, a
dialog: couple of dollars in change, a ring -- and slaps them down
dialog: in front of her.
text: The Police fan out along the ridge above them. He jams a
text: flare pistol into his belt and kisses her goodbye--after
text: a moment's hesitation -- on the cheek. She tries in vain
dialog: to hold him back.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I wish I could tell you how much
dialog: I love you.
speaker_heading: 309	EXT. MUD FLAT
text: Bill runs from the thicket down to the water. The Police
dialog: have bunched on the other side. It seems he might be able
text: to escape. Keeping low, he splashes across a mud flat.
text: Suddenly he runs into a trot line that a fisherman has
text: left out overnight. The hooks bite into his thigh and
text: shoulder, yanking a string of startled, thrashing catfish
dialog: out of the water.
text: He keeps running in a panic, not realizing the line is
text: staked to the shore. All at once, he jackknifes in the
text: air. The stake twangs loose. The Police now spot him
dialog: and begin firing.
speaker_heading: 310	TIGHT ON ABBY
text: Abby runs out of hiding, thinking at first that the Police
dialog: must be looking for her.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Why're you shooting? You'll kill him! Have you gone crazy?
dialog: Stop! Oh, Bill, not you! Not you!
speaker_heading: 311	NEW ANGLE
text: Bill stumbles along, trying to rip the hooks from his
dialog: flesh, but the fish--fighting their way back to the
dialog: water--only drive them in deeper.
text: Ahead two MOUNTED POLICE surge into the river, blocking
dialog: his retreat.
text: He empties his shotgun at them and throws it away. They
text: hold up, astonished. He dashes across a sand bar for the
dialog: deep of the river and comparative safety. Black mud clings
text: to his feet, drawing him down like a fly in molasses.
text: Benson goes running out into the river ahead of the Police.
speaker_heading: BENSON
dialog: Leave him alone. I want him. Leave him alone.
dialog: (firing)
dialog: There you go! There you go!
text: He shoots Bill down. Bill turns and looks at him in sur-
text: prise. Benson shoots him again, point blank.
speaker_heading: 312	UNDERWATER SHOT
text: Bill's blood fades off quickly in the gliding water of the
text: river. The line of frightened catfish dances out behind
dialog: him like a garland.
speaker_heading: 313	OTHER ANGLES
text: A dog trots off in alarm.
text: Benson wades into shore, tears streaming down his face,
dialog: his chest heaving with emotion.
text: Abby falls to the ground in a convulsion of grief.
dialog: A short way down the river PEOPLE come and go along the
dialog: bridge where they were to meet.
speaker_heading: 314	ISOLATED ON ROLLER PIANO
text: A roller piano sits in a corner by itself, playing a fox-
dialog: trot. The camera moves back.
speaker_heading: 315	INT. ARBORETUM - ATTIC
dialog: YOUNG DANCERS are learning the foxtrot in the attic of the
dialog: Arboretum, a tacky Western version of an Eastern finishing
text: school. The steps are painted on the floor as white footprints.
text: Abby is apparently enrolling Ursula here. The headmistress,
dialog: MADAME MURPHY, boasts of the school's achievements.
text: Ursula looks trapped. Abby checks her watch.
dialog: She must go.
speaker_heading: 316	EXT. BRICK STREET
text: Abby and Ursula walk down an empty street. Abby wears a
dialog: mourning band on her sleeve. She is under the false im-
dialog: pression that Ursula likes her new home. An INDIAN PORTER
text: carts her bags along behind them in a wheelbarrow.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: They'll teach you poise, too, so you can walk in any room you
dialog: please. Pretty soon you'll know all kind of things.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I never read a whole book till I was fifteen. It was by Caesar.
dialog: They laugh at her careful pronunciation of "Caesar."
speaker_heading: 317	EXT. TRAIN STATION
text: Abby's train is about to leave. The CONDUCTOR walks by
text: blowing a whistle. A five-piece BAND plays Sousa airs.
dialog: They are practically the only civilians on the platform.
dialog: The rest are SOLDIERS bound for Europe, where America has
dialog: just entered the War, on fire with excitement and a sense
dialog: of high adventure.
speaker_heading: URSULA
dialog: I like your hat.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: It doesn't seem like a bird came down and landed on my head?
dialog: Abby takes the hat off and gives it to Ursula, who lately
dialog: has begun to take more trouble with her appearance, comb-
text: ing her hair free of its usual snarls. They laugh at their reflection
dialog: in a window of the train.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: I hardly ever wear it. Be sure and write every week.
text: Signals nod. A lamp winks. There are leave-takings up
text: and down the platform as the train slides away. Abby hops
text: on board. A SOLDIER next to her sheds bitter tears.
speaker_heading: URSULA
dialog: You write me, too!
dialog: They wave goodbye.
speaker_heading: 318	EXT. ARBORETUM - NIGHT
dialog: Late that evening Ursula lowers herself out a third-floor
dialog: window of the Arboretum with a rope made of bedsheets.
speaker_heading: 319	TIGHT ON GIRLS AT WINDOW
dialog: The other GIRLS stand in their nightgowns and wave good-
dialog: bye, amazed at her boldness.
dialog: She slips off into the night.
speaker_heading: 320	EXT. BACKSTAGE DOOR - NIGHT
text: Ursula looks in a backstage door. She can see, through
text: the wings, a MAN dancing on stage. There is a feeling of
dialog: mad excitement about the place.
dialog: The person she is looking for is not here, however.
scene_heading: 321	EXT. ALLEY - URSULA'S THEME - NIGHT
text: She runs down an alley. A man steps out of the shadows--
text: George, the pilot. She throws herself in his arms. This
dialog: is our first sight of him since he left the bonanza.
speaker_heading: URSULA
dialog: You're here! Oh, hug me!
text: They kiss madly, with mystery. The moonlit, midsummer night thrums
speaker_heading: URSULA
dialog: Aren't we happy? Oh, George, has anybody ever been this happy?
text: He rocks her back and forth in his arms. They laugh,
dialog: thinking what lucky exceptions they are to the world's
dialog: misery.
speaker_heading: URSULA
dialog: Hurry. They'll be looking for me.
speaker_heading: 322	EXT. AIRPLANE - DAWN
text: George bundles Ursula, giggling, into a biplane.
speaker_heading: URSULA
dialog: This doesn't even belong to you. Suppose they catch us?
speaker_heading: 323	EXT. PASTURE -- DAWN
text: From a pasture outside town the plane rises into the vast dawn sky.
speaker_heading: 324	INT. TEXTILE FACTORY
text: Abby changes bobbins on a huge loom. A pall of lint and
text: anonymous toil hangs over the factory. Down the way a
text: handsome MALE WORKER smiles at her. She smiles back,
dialog: interested.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: It seems an age we've been apart, and truly is for those who
dialog: love each other so. Whenever shall we meet?'
speaker_heading: 325	TIGHT ON MACHINERY
dialog: The shuttle rockets back and forth. Off camera we hear
dialog: Abby reading what seems part of a letter to Ursula.
speaker_heading: ABBY (o.s.)
dialog: Soon, I hope, for by and by we'll all be gone, Urs. Does
dialog: it really seem as though we might?'
speaker_heading: 326	UNDERWATER SHOT
text: We look from the bottom of a river up toward the light.
text: In the foreground, dangling from the tip of a submerged
dialog: limb, is the bracelet Abby threw away.
speaker_heading: ABBY (o.s.)
dialog: 'The other day I tried to think how I'd look laid out in a solemn
dialog: white gown. Closing my eyes I could almost hear you tiptoe inlook down in my face, so deep asleep, so still.
speaker_heading: 327	EXT. FIELDS - SERIES OF ANGLES
dialog: The PEOPLE of the Razumihin rebuild the land -- raising
text: fences and sinking a well, plowing down the stubble and
dialog: putting in the seed.
speaker_heading: ABBY (o.s.)
dialog: 'I went to Lincoln Park Zoo the other day. It was great as usual.
dialog: I enclose a check.'
text: An ANONYMOUS YOUNG MAN, standing on a carpet
dialog: of new-sprung wheat, looks up with a start. From the
dialog: distance comes a ghostly noise--the call of the prairie
text: chickens at their spring rites. He listens for just a moment,
dialog: then returns to work.
speaker_heading: THE END
dialog:
