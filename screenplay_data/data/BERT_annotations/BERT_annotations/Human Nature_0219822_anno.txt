scene_heading: BLACKNESS.
text: There is a gunshot. A crow screams. A fluttering of wings.
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST - DAY
text: Bird's-eye view. We circle lazily above the forest.
text: Through a break in the trees, we catch an occasional glimpse
text: of a prostrate form on the ground. As the circling camera
text: gets closer we see that the form is a human body.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: EXTREME CLOSE-UP OF LILA TALKING TO THE CAMERA
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: I'm not sorry.
text: A bead of sweat trickles down her cheek. Then: a blinding
text: flash of light obliterates her face.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: EXTREME CLOSE-UP OF PUFF TALKING TO THE CAMERA
speaker_heading: PUFF
dialog: I am sorry.
text: A tear wells in Puff's eye and runs down his face. Another

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: EXTREME CLOSE-UP OF NATHAN TALKING TO THE CAMERA
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: I don't even know what sorry means
dialog: anymore.
text: As Nathan speaks, a trickle of blood drips down his face
text: from his out-of-frame forehead. Another blinding flash of
text: light.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT
text: It's a frenetic hand-held shot as Lila is pulled from a police
text: car and dragged into the precinct house. Cameras flash.
text: Reporters shout questions. Lila attempts to shield her face
text: from view, but she is handcuffed and can only manage to hunch
text: her shoulders.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT
text: A ratty interrogation room. Institutional green walls.
text: Beat-up file cabinets. Dark. A bit of fluorescent light spills
text: in through the frosted glass door. Lila, thirties, sits at
text: the end of a long table. A reel-to-reel tape recorder whirs
text: in front of her. She is smoking. Three fat, mean-looking
text: cops sit in shadows at the other end of the table. One of
text: the cops eyes her lasciviously. Lila's hand shakes as she
text: brings the cigarette to her mouth.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: I'm not sorry. So I spend the rest
dialog: of my life in jail. So what? I've
dialog: been in jail my whole life anyway. A
text: jail of blood and tissue and coursing
dialog: hormones...
text: One of the cops sighs and massages the bridge of his nose.
dialog: It's going to be a long night.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: ...a jail called the human body.
text: The lascivious cop smiles lasciviously at Lila's reference
dialog: to "human body."
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: My soul held prisoner in this reeking,
text: stench-ridden bag of bones and
text: entrails. A bag of feces and piss
text: and fibroid cysts in my tits and
text: precancerous moles on my sun-damaged
dialog: back...
text: The lascivious cop gags, then vomits on the floor. Lila drags
text: on her cigarette, calmer now.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: At least now I'll be able to blame
dialog: the state, not God, for my
dialog: incarceration.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY
text: Puff, thirties, dirty, scraggly hair and beard but in a crisp
text: business suit, testifies before a congressional committee.
text: The auditorium is filled with reporters and spectators. Puff
text: sits in front of a microphone, counsel at his side. He pours
text: himself a glass of water, drinks, clears his throat, then
text: speaks: stentorian, confident.
speaker_heading: PUFF
dialog: I am sorry, gentlemen, sorry for all
dialog: of us. Your's is a complicated, sad
dialog: world.
text: This is a revelation to the assembled crowd. People whisper
text: to each other.
speaker_heading: PUFF
dialog: And I never knew that. I was living
dialog: a life of simplicity, of purity,
dialog: when I was ripped out of my Eden and
text: immersed in this harshness. Some
dialog: would argue that the life I was living
dialog: was not a human life at all. And,
dialog: gentlemen, I don't have any clever
dialog: retort. I am not a philosopher. The
dialog: only thing I know is that I am sorry,
dialog: sorry for my expulsion from Eden,
dialog: sorry for my Lila rotting in her
dialog: jail cell, and sorry for Nathan...
text: rotting in his grave.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. WHITE SPACE - DAY
text: Nathan, thirties, in a white robe, sits alone at a white
text: table. Everything is white except for an oozing bullet wound
text: in Nathan's temple.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: I don't even know what sorry means
dialog: anymore. It's odd. When I was alive
dialog: I knew -- maybe it was all I knew --
dialog: but here sorry is meaningless. Love
dialog: is meaningless. Jealousy is
text: meaningless. Ambition is meaningless.
dialog: Everything that motivated my every
dialog: breath while I was alive is
text: meaningless now.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I guess that's how I can be sure I'm
dialog: really dead.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

speaker_heading: COP

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY
text: It's got that faded, "memory" look. Twelve year old Lila
text: hurries home from school, books clutched to her chest.
text: Other kids walk along the street in pairs or groups, laughing
text: and chatting. Lila walks alone, a worried scowl on her face.
speaker_heading: LILA (V.O.)
dialog: Something terrible happened when I
dialog: was twelve.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LITTLE GIRL'S ROOM - DAY
text: Colors are still muted. It looks to be somewhere in the early
text: 70's based on the preponderance of Bay City Rollers posters
text: on the wall. Twelve year old Lila enters the room, closes
text: the door, locks it, rattles the doorknob to make sure that
text: the door is really locked. She draws the shades. She pulls
text: some t-shirts from her dresser drawer and stuffs them into
text: the space between the bottom of the door and the floor.
speaker_heading: KID BROTHER (O.S.)
dialog: (muffled)
dialog: Hey, no fair!
scene_heading: TWELVE YEAR OLD LILA
dialog: Drop dead, Eric.
text: Lila stands nervously in front of the full-length mirror on
text: her closet door. She takes a deep breath and begins to
text: unbutton her shirt, watching herself carefully in the mirror.
speaker_heading: ADULT LILA (V.O.)
dialog: Something terrible started to happen
dialog: to my body when I was twelve. My
dialog: mother said because of it I would
dialog: never be able to get a man, so I
dialog: should get used to the idea of
dialog: dedicating my life to the pursuit of
dialog: knowledge, or religion... or whatever.
text: Lila's shirt is now unbuttoned. She pulls it open. She is
text: wearing a training bra over the very beginning of breast
text: buds. On the chest above the bra, and on her stomach below
text: it, is hair. Dark curly hair. She stares at it, touches it
text: cautiously. Then she starts to cry. She crouches into a ball
text: and weeps.
speaker_heading: ADULT LILA (V.O.)
dialog: The doctor said...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Old fashioned office. Twelve year old Lila sits on the
text: examination table, her shirt off. An elderly male doctor
text: touches the hair, fingers it. Her mother looks on.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: (to the mother)
dialog: It's hormonal. Nature is a funny and
dialog: complex thing. It could get worse
dialog: with time.
text: Young Lila turns to the camera.
scene_heading: TWELVE YEAR OLD LILA
dialog: By the time I was twenty I looked
text: like an ape.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY
text: Puff testifies before the committee.
speaker_heading: PUFF
dialog: I don't think there's anyone in the
dialog: world who doesn't know by now that I
dialog: was raised in the wilderness by an
dialog: ape. Well, to be fair, by a man who
dialog: thought himself an ape, but it amounts
dialog: to the same thing gentlemen, does it
dialog: not?
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST CLEARING - DAY.

speaker_heading: PUFF (V.O.)
dialog: My father escaped from a New Jersey
dialog: mental institution in 1963.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT
text: It's raining and deserted. Puff's father, in pajamas, comes
text: tearing around the corner. He runs crazily towards the camera,
text: waving his arms, puffing out his cheeks.
speaker_heading: PUFF (V.O.)
dialog: He had been committed the previous
dialog: year after applying one too many
dialog: times at our local zoo for the job
dialog: of "apprentice ape."
text: Puff's father passes a newspaper vending machine, stops,
text: goes back and examines the headline. It reads: President
text: Kennedy Assassinated. Puff's father looks heavenward and
text: clutches at his temples in despair.
speaker_heading: PUFF (V.O.)
dialog: My father saw what the human race

scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - NIGHT

text: an ape like himself.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY
text: Puff looks pointedly at the congressman.
speaker_heading: PUFF
dialog: Apes don't assassinate their

dialog: them.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST - DAY
text: An adult Puff and his now older father sit on the forest
text: floor and pick bugs off each other and eat them.
speaker_heading: PUFF (V.O.)

scene_heading: INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY
text: Puff testifies.
speaker_heading: PUFF
dialog: It might be argued, gentlemen, that
dialog: apes don't even know that they are
dialog: apes. In retrospect, however, I'd
dialog: say that I was a pygmy chimp.
text: Puff holds up an illustration of a pygmy chimp. Several

speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: I have to say I always hated apes.
dialog: Of course I don't any longer. I don't
dialog: even know what hate means now. But
dialog: while alive, I hated apes. I blame
dialog: my parents. I mean, I don't blame
dialog: them. I don't know what blame is,
dialog: really, anymore, but I think they
dialog: influenced me in my ape-hating
dialog: tendencies.

scene_heading: EXT. ZOO - DAY
text: Faded colors. Ten year old Nathan in a bow tie and shortpanted

scene_heading: NATHAN AS A BOY
dialog: Monkeys! Look, mama, monkeys!
speaker_heading: MOTHER
text: (clamping down on his
dialog: shoulder)
dialog: Nathan, those are not monkeys. Those
dialog: are apes. Mountain Gorillas to be
dialog: precise.
text: There is a commotion off screen. Two uniformed attendants
text: drag Puff's father, straitjacketed and kicking and screaming
text: like an ape, past Nathan and his parents.
speaker_heading: PUFF'S FATHER
dialog: I am not a human being! I am an
dialog: animal!
text: Nathan, his father, and the other zoo patrons look on
text: curiously, a little frightened. Nathan's mother chooses to
dialog: ignore it.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: And furthermore... Tell him, Harold.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: (distracted)
dialog: Uh...
dialog: (then by rote)
dialog: We must never act like apes, son.
dialog: For you see, The ape is our closest
dialog: biological relative -- specifically
text: the pygmy chimp.
dialog: (holds up the same
dialog: illustration of a
dialog: pygmy chimp that
dialog: Puff showed the
dialog: congressional
dialog: committee)
text: A single chromosome separates us.
dialog: But you know what truly separates us
dialog: from the apes, what makes us better
dialog: than apes?
scene_heading: NATHAN AS A BOY
dialog: No, papa. What?
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Culture. Civilization. Refinement.
dialog: If we do not have these as humans,
dialog: then we might as well be living in
text: pens and throwing our feces about,
text: masturbating in public...
dialog: (beat, a reverie)

speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: Oh, I had sexual urges. I had the

dialog: was 100% Grade A female.
dialog: (laughs derisively)
dialog: But what self-loathing I felt! Who
dialog: would have someone as repulsive, as

dialog: repulsiveness.

speaker_heading: FEMALE ROOMMATE (O.S.)

speaker_heading: FEMALE ROOMMATE

speaker_heading: LILA

speaker_heading: FEMALE ROOMMATE

speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: Yeah, Natalie. It's hair. It grows.
speaker_heading: FEMALE ROOMMATE
dialog: Well, don't jump down my throat. I'm

speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: How is that helping, Natalie? How
dialog: exactly?
speaker_heading: FEMALE ROOMMATE
dialog: Look, if you're going to be like
dialog: that... You should be appreciative
dialog: that I'm interested.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: Why, because I'm a freak and you are
dialog: beautiful, and you are being nice
dialog: enough to come down to my freak,
dialog: nonbeautiful level and act concerned
dialog: about my repulsive troubles?
speaker_heading: FEMALE ROOMMATE
dialog: (pegged)
dialog: You're fucked up, Lila.
dialog: (out the door)
dialog: Why don't you fucking try electrolysis
dialog: or something? Figure it out for
dialog: chrissake.
text: The door slams. Lila hugs her knees to her chest.
speaker_heading: LILA (V.O.)

scene_heading: INT. ART MUSEUM - DAY
text: Twelve year old Lila walks sadly through an art museum. she
text: looks at various old portraits of men. She studies their

text: a large Renaissance painting of a naked woman entirely covered
text: with fur. She hurries to it. She looks at the placard next
text: to the painting. It is a painting of Mary Magdalene.
speaker_heading: LILA (V.O.)
dialog: I remember once coming across a
text: painting of Mary Magdalene entirely
dialog: covered with fur. I guess that's
dialog: where I got the idea that maybe the
dialog: Catholic Church might be a place
dialog: that encouraged excessive hair growth
dialog: in its women.
scene_heading: INT. CONVENT - DAY
text: Lila, in a nun's habit, is on her knees praying.
speaker_heading: LILA (V.O.)

speaker_heading: LILA (V.O.)
dialog: I decided there was something poetic

speaker_heading: LILA (V.O.)
text: Birds and squirrels and rocks and

speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: I knew it was coming when in late

speaker_heading: ROSE

speaker_heading: ROSE

speaker_heading: LILA

speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Loves animals. Loves you.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Somehow it came up that you were a
dialog: friend of mine. Mr. handsome, animal-
dialog: loving psychologist said he would
dialog: love to meet you.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: Holy shit. Your brother didn't tell
dialog: him about the nature of our
dialog: relationship, did he?
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: My brother is discreet.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: (rubbing her hand
text: over her jaw)
dialog: Won't he be able to tell?
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: My brother says the guy's a thirty-
dialog: five year old virgin, so maybe he
dialog: won't know how women usually feel.
dialog: Plus he's got bad eyesight, almost
dialog: legally blind, which is helpful in
dialog: this situation. Plus he's got an
dialog: extremely small penis, of which he
dialog: is "mortifyingly ashamed", so chances
dialog: are he'll be so grateful for any non-
dialog: judgmental attention, that he'll be
dialog: yours forever.
speaker_heading: LILA

speaker_heading: NATHAN
text: Meditations on a Banana Slug was a

speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: Thank you so much. I love slugs. All
text: slugs, not just banana slugs.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: As do I.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: They're so even keel. They forge
text: ahead with slow determination. They
dialog: don't get distracted or side-tracked.
dialog: They don't care what they look like.
dialog: They don't care that people look at
text: them and go, "Ewww. A slug."
speaker_heading: NATHAN
text: They don't seem to be especially ego
dialog: driven, this is true.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: You've got to respect that.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: I have to say that I'm not there
dialog: yet.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Slugdom. Sluggishness. Whatever you'd
dialog: call it. I'm not there yet. I still
dialog: have many human characteristics.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: That's not necessarily a bad thing.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Yes. I suppose not. But still. One
dialog: would like to move along. To move
dialog: beyond.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: I'm not sure we can escape our
dialog: natures. Believe me I've tried. I'm
dialog: not even so sure anymore that we
dialog: should want to.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: I love that you said that. It makes
dialog: me feel a bit lighter. I've been
dialog: rather heavy lately. Thinking about
dialog: my childhood. Realizing how much a
dialog: product I am of my upbringing.
dialog: (beat, cautiously)
dialog: I've been seeing someone. A therapist.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: (feigning surprise)
dialog: You are a therapist, right?
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: No no. I'm a psychologist, but I do
dialog: research. I'm a behaviorist. I work
text: with animals. Mice at the moment.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: I hope you don't perform any of those
dialog: dreadful torture experiments, Nathan.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Heavens no. My work now is... Right
dialog: now I'm teaching mice... well, table
dialog: manners, to be candid.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: (beat. doesn't know
dialog: what to say)
dialog: How's it going?
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Quite well, really. It's a lot of
dialog: work. A lot of reinforcement, mostly
dialog: positive. Right now I've gotten two
dialog: of my subjects to use napkins. Tiny
dialog: napkins of course.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: Paper or cloth?
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: I hope you don't think me daft. It's
dialog: important work. It's part of a larger
dialog: sociological experiment. I'm federally
dialog: funded.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: What's the larger experiment?
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: It's my thesis that if table manners
dialog: can be taught to mice, they can be
dialog: taught to humans.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: Going out on a limb, aren't you,
dialog: Nathan?
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: (speech)
dialog: The truth is most people don't have
dialog: table manners today. And when the
dialog: foundations of civilized society
text: crumble and disappear, civilized
dialog: society in its entirely follows
text: closely at its heels.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: I'm not sure.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: (stridently)
dialog: Courtesy, decorum, manners, are all
dialog: sadly lacking from our daily
dialog: intercourse. Rudeness, vulgarity,
dialog: meanness are the norm.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: We are animals after all.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Ergo if I can teach table manners to
dialog: mice, I can teach them to humans. If
dialog: I can teach table manners to humans,
dialog: I can save the world.

speaker_heading: WENDALL
dialog: And do you think maybe this early

speaker_heading: NATHAN

text: front of each of them is a little plate of salad and three
text: forks of varying size under Lucite domes.
text: Nathan nods to his pretty French assistant, Gabrielle, who
text: presses a button. The Lucite domes over the salads lift.
text: Tentatively both mice reach for a fork. There is a tiny piece
text: of velcro on each mouse's paw and a tiny piece of velcro on
text: each of the forks. The first mouse picks the correct fork,
text: and stabs it into the salad and eats happily, relieved. The
text: second mouse picks the wrong fork. Nathan presses a button,
text: which sends the mouse flying off his chair with an electric

speaker_heading: ROSE

speaker_heading: LILA

speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Well he wasn't really a midget. He

speaker_heading: LILA

speaker_heading: ROSE

text: Puff cocks his head. The high timbre of her voice surprises
text: him, pleases him, but he doesn't understand the words.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: You don't understand my language, do
dialog: you?
text: Puff looks at his crotch. Apparently there is some activity
text: down there. Lila, following his eyes, glances down there
dialog: also.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: I take it back, you do understand my
dialog: language.
text: Puff grabs for his crotch and begins to play with himself
text: distractedly, looking at her all the while. He falls out of
text: the tree. Lila gasps. Branches crack and snap as he passes
text: through them and then there is an unpleasant thud when he
text: hits the forest floor. Lila shimmies down the tree, and kneels
text: by Puff. He is unconscious.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: Oh God.
text: Nathan comes limping through the brush. Somehow his safari
text: suit and boots are as clean and pressed as they were in the
text: car. He is carrying Lila's clothes. Somehow he has had time
text: to neatly fold them.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Oh my God! Is he dead? Please put
text: something on.
text: Lila looks up at icily at Nathan.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: You'll catch cold. It's cold.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What do you suppose he is, a
dialog: survivalist?
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: I think he's feral.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: (jumping back)
dialog: Feral? Don't touch him! He might be
dialog: diseased! He might... My God, rabies!
speaker_heading: LILA
text: He looks perfectly fine.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: I think we should go. Please. Before
dialog: he wakes up and, I don't know, eats
dialog: us, or whatever feral things do.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: I don't understand you. This is
dialog: fascinating and you just want to run
dialog: away. I mean, here we have a human
text: being totally uncontaminated by
dialog: civilization, totally free, and all
dialog: you want to do is run back to your...
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: (thinking)
dialog: Actually, I just had an amusing
dialog: thought.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: (musing)
dialog: Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated?
speaker_heading: LILA
text: Look at him. He doesn't understand
text: English. He moves like an animal.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: It's perfect!
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: Nathan, what the hell are you talking
dialog: about?
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: (doing a little dance)
dialog: Forget mice! Actually forget guinea
text: pigs, cats, monkeys, and chimps also.
dialog: I'm on to stage five: The human
dialog: subject.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: Oh no. You can't take him from his
dialog: home, Nathan.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: (ranting)
dialog: Don't you see? He's my Tabula Rasa,
dialog: my Eliza Dolittle. He's my ticket to
text: the top of the Behaviorist food chain.
dialog: He's going to make me famous.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: I won't allow you. It's wrong. He's
dialog: happy here.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Is he, Lila? Is he happy living filthy
text: and naked alone in this tick infested
dialog: wilderness? Never to know the love
dialog: of a good woman, never to revel in
text: the pitter-patter of little feet,
dialog: never to read Moby Dick, or marvel
dialog: at a Monet, or just sit back after a
dialog: day of hard but rewarding work, smoke
text: a pipe, and wonder about the nature
dialog: of reality.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: (weakening resolve)
dialog: You'd be taking away his freedom,
dialog: Nathan.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Freedom's just another word for
dialog: nothing left to lose, Lila, to quote
dialog: Janet Jackson.
text: Lila looks off into the distance, her eyes brimming with
text: tears. As Nathan continues his speech, we move closer and
text: closer into Lila's eyes. Nathan's voice fades into nothing
dialog: by the time we dissolve.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
text: Belonging to something, a person or
text: a society, is a basic human craving.
dialog: We are communal creatures. This poor
dialog: soul has no one, nothing...
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CLIFF - SUNSET
text: A naked, very hairy Lila sits by herself on the cliff and
text: watches the sunset. There's a chill in the air and she shivers

speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: Oh God, I have no one. Nothing. You
dialog: give me this beautiful gift, this
text: glorious sunset. But with no one to
dialog: say "isn't that a beautiful sunset"
dialog: to, it becomes meaningless, just
dialog: another stupid sunset. They happen
dialog: everyday. So what?
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST - DAY
text: Lila is hovering over the unconscious Puff. Nathan's voice
text: comes back into focus. He is still speechifying.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: ...what is it that makes us human,
dialog: if not the knowledge that we are
dialog: indeed human? Think of this poor
dialog: soul's education as the greatest
dialog: gift we could bestow upon...
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: All right.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Great. Grab his feet. We'll throw

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LAB - DAY
text: Nathan hovers over the Lucite case with the tiny dinner table
text: in it. His assistant, Gabrielle, presses a button, a door
text: opens, and two white mice scurry in. The male pulls out a
text: chair for the female. The female climbs up on the chair, and
text: the male pushes the chair in, then scurries around to the
text: other side of the table and climbs onto his own chair. The
text: Lucite lid over the silverware and salads lifts and both
text: mice pick up the proper forks and begin eating. Nathan
text: scribbles in his notebook.
speaker_heading: GABRIELLE
dialog: Doctor...
text: Nathan looks up. Gabrielle jerks her head in the direction
text: of a very large Lucite case. Inside, Puff, now dressed in a
text: diaper and connected to all sorts of electrodes, is stirring.
text: Nathan and Gabrielle hurry over.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Good morning.
text: Puff groggily takes in his surroundings. This is quite a lot
text: to take in. The white room, the strange apes in strange suits,
text: his own clothing, the wires. After surveying the scene for a
text: moment, Puff becomes frightened and agitated.
text: He tries to escape. Not understanding Lucite, he smashes
text: into it, again and again. He tears at his diaper. Nathan
text: gives a nod to Gabrielle, who presses a button on a panel.
text: An electric shock sends Puff flying. He lies on the floor
text: confused and dazed. After a moment, he gets up and again
text: crashes into the Lucite. Nathan gives the signal to Gabrielle
text: and once again she shocks Puff. He once again gets up and
text: crashes against the Lucite. Again he is shocked. He gets up
text: again, and is about to crash against the Lucite, but he thinks
text: better of it, and squats in place, immobilized.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: (to Gabrielle)
text: Only three shocks. A chimp takes
dialog: fifteen. This is going to be tres
dialog: simple, no, Gabrielle?
speaker_heading: GABRIELLE
dialog: (in love with Nathan)
dialog: Oui, doctor, oui.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: (to Puff)
dialog: Good morning...
dialog: (to Gabrielle)
dialog: We need a name for him, don't we?
speaker_heading: GABRIELLE
dialog: Oui.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: You decide. Today is your day.
speaker_heading: GABRIELLE
dialog: Really? My day? Well, I had a sweet
dialog: little mongrel puppie named Puff
dialog: when I was a girl. This one reminds
dialog: me of my dog, all shaggy! So cute!
dialog: (giggles girlishly)
dialog: I loved my doggie very much, monsieur.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: (charmed)
text: Puff it is then. Puff Bronfman. Is
dialog: that okay?
speaker_heading: GABRIELLE
dialog: Oui. Perfect!
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: (to Puff)
dialog: Good morning, Puff Bronfman. I'm Dr.
dialog: Bronfman and this is my assistant
dialog: Gabrielle. We're your mommy and daddy
dialog: while you are here.
text: Gabrielle likes this concept a great deal. She smiles and
text: moves closer to Nathan.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: (to Puff)
dialog: How about some salad, son?
text: Gabrielle poises her finger above the button. She winks at
text: Nathan. He blushes.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - EVENING

speaker_heading: GABRIELLE
dialog: Dr. Bronfman! Dr. Bronfman!
text: Nathan turns.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Oh, Hi, Gabrielle.
speaker_heading: GABRIELLE
dialog: (out of breath)
dialog: Hi. I just wanted to tell you that I
dialog: very much enjoy working with you.
dialog: (blushes)
dialog: Now I'm embarrassed that I say this.
text: They walk along.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: No. Don't be. I really enjoy hearing
dialog: that. You're a terrific assistant.
speaker_heading: GABRIELLE
dialog: Merci. I... Do you... would you like
dialog: to go get a cup of coffee, perhaps?
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Well, I don't know. I'm actually on
dialog: my way to...
speaker_heading: GABRIELLE
dialog: Now I am truly embarrassed. Forgive
dialog: me. I should not have asked such a
dialog: stupid question. I know you are a
dialog: very important man and...
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: No. Don't be silly. It's just...
speaker_heading: GABRIELLE
dialog: I am a foolish little thing. I am
dialog: pink in my face, no? It is only that
dialog: I have been so lonely lately and...
dialog: I am ashamed. I'll see you tomorrow,

speaker_heading: GABRIELLE

speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Not at all.
speaker_heading: GABRIELLE
dialog: I have had such a difficult time in
dialog: my personal life and you seem to be
dialog: such a nice man... but I'm talking
dialog: too much again, no?
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Of course not.
speaker_heading: GABRIELLE
dialog: You're so sweet. Oh, why are there
dialog: not more men out there like you?
text: Gabrielle starts to cry softly. Nathan doesn't know what to

speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: There there.
text: Gabrielle looks up at him appreciatively. She sniffs.
speaker_heading: GABRIELLE
dialog: You know just the right thing to
dialog: say.
text: She reaches across the table and touches his hand lightly
text: for a moment.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Listen, you're the best assistant

speaker_heading: NATHAN

speaker_heading: LILA (O.S.)

speaker_heading: NATHAN

speaker_heading: LILA (O.S.)
dialog: Who is it, Nathan?
text: Nathan opens the bathroom door.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Look, Lila, when I'm on a work...

speaker_heading: LILA

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. GABRIELLE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: The lights are low. The room is peppered with lit candles.

dialog: speaker.
speaker_heading: LILA (O.S.)
dialog: It's hormonal, Nathan. I can't help
dialog: it. I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: NATHAN (O.S.)
dialog: Your entire body?
speaker_heading: LILA (O.S.)
dialog: I'm getting electrolysis. It's

speaker_heading: NATHAN (O.S.)

speaker_heading: LILA (O.S.)

speaker_heading: NATHAN (O.S.)
dialog: Don't quibble. You know what I mean.
speaker_heading: LILA (O.S.)
dialog: I'm sorry. Please don't be mad at me

speaker_heading: NATHAN (O.S.)
dialog: Mad? I'm I'm... disgusted!
speaker_heading: LILA (O.S.)
dialog: I'm the same person I was before you

speaker_heading: NATHAN (O.S.)
dialog: I have to think! I have to think!

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LAB - NIGHT
text: Nathan paces in front of Puff's Lucite case. Puff watches
text: suspiciously from the corner where he is huddled. The lights
text: are off. But there is a green glow from a couple of exit
dialog: signs.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: I don't get it. I don't get it. I
dialog: don't get it. How could I find myself
dialog: in this mess? This is a mess. This
dialog: is not a situation I understand.
dialog: This is a mess. How do I extricate
dialog: myself from this mess? Is my
dialog: girlfriend a man? I don't understand.
dialog: This is not part of any plan. She
dialog: deceived me. She has hair.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But am I being fair? So what if she
dialog: has hair? Who am I to judge? I have
dialog: hair.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But I'm supposed to have hair. I am
text: a man. Men are supposed to have hair.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But poor Lila. Think of what she's
dialog: had to go through. The courage she's
dialog: had to have in the face of this
dialog: abomination of nature. I should love
dialog: her all the more. I should love every
dialog: hair on her body. I mean, she doesn't
dialog: mind that I have a mortifyingly
dialog: small...
text: The lights flick on. Nathan turns with a start. It's
text: Gabrielle. She's in an overcoat. She gasps.
speaker_heading: GABRIELLE
dialog: Oh, Doctor. I did not know. I'm sorry
dialog: to disturb you. I just came for some
dialog: papers I left.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Gabrielle. No, I'm sorry if I startled
dialog: you. I came to think.
dialog: (beat, remembering)
dialog: God, Did I hang up on you?
speaker_heading: GABRIELLE
dialog: Oui. Perhaps I called at a bad time.
dialog: I am sorry.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: No. I just got distracted. I'm so
dialog: sorry.
speaker_heading: GABRIELLE
dialog: Is everything fine?
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Oui.
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Now you've got me talking French.
speaker_heading: GABRIELLE
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: I was in my p.j.'s when I remembered
dialog: I left some papers I need to go over.
dialog: (opens overcoat to
dialog: reveal lingerie)
dialog: See? I rushed right out of the house.
dialog: I must look a mess. I'm so
dialog: embarrassed.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: (taken)
dialog: I'm in my p.j.'s, too. Funny, huh?
text: Puff is taken also. His eyes are wide.
speaker_heading: GABRIELLE
dialog: Coincidence, yes?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And how is our son?
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Our...? Oh!
dialog: (laughs, out of control)
dialog: He seems fine. I guess we woke him.
dialog: The lights and all.
speaker_heading: GABRIELLE
dialog: I should turn them off.
dialog: (she does)
dialog: Maybe I sing him a lullaby my mama
dialog: sang to me when I was a little girl.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: (a little giddy)
dialog: When you were a little French girl?
speaker_heading: GABRIELLE
dialog: Oui.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: (back in control)
dialog: That would be good.
text: Gabrielle kneels by Puff's case. Puff crawls over, tries to
text: touch her through the Lucite. Gabrielle sings a French
text: lullaby. It's very sweet. Nathan watches her, looks at her
text: thigh, her hair, the delicate way the tip of her nose moves
text: when she sings. Puff gets drowsy. He curls up on the floor
text: and sleeps.
speaker_heading: GABRIELLE
dialog: (quietly to Nathan)
dialog: There.
text: Nathan stares at her, transfixed. She pretends not to notice.
speaker_heading: GABRIELLE
dialog: Shall we close up, then?
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Maybe we should just sit for a while.
dialog: It's very peaceful.
speaker_heading: GABRIELLE
dialog: It's nice, yes. I'm glad I ran into
dialog: you, both in our silly pajamas. It
dialog: is two happy coincidences, no?
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Yes. Happy happy.
speaker_heading: GABRIELLE
dialog: Yet you look so sad. A great man
dialog: like you should not be sad.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: I'm fine. Life is funny, that's all.
text: Gabrielle stands. She stretches languorously, revealing a
dialog: lot of leg.
speaker_heading: GABRIELLE
dialog: I am sleepy.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: I shouldn't say this, but you're
dialog: pretty, Gabrielle. It's
dialog: unprofessional, I know.
speaker_heading: GABRIELLE
dialog: Really? I always think myself so
text: ugly. No, not ugly, but plain. A
text: wallflower.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: (buying her line)
dialog: Really? No. Not at all. You're a
dialog: very pretty girl. You should know
dialog: that. You should be confident.
speaker_heading: GABRIELLE
dialog: Thank you so much. Merci. It's very
dialog: wonderful to hear a man say such a
dialog: nice compliment.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: It's true. I wouldn't lie.
speaker_heading: GABRIELLE
dialog: You are sweet.
text: Gabrielle walks slowly by Nathan. He inhales deeply, breathing
text: her in. She smiles to herself. He reaches out touches her
dialog: leg.
speaker_heading: GABRIELLE
dialog: (vaguely protesting)
dialog: Doctor.
text: She moves into Nathan. She presses her thigh against his
text: shoulder. Nathan leans forward, kisses her exposed thigh.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: So soft. So smooth.

speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: You are an animal.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Really? Wow! That's that's terrific
dialog: to hear from someone so... feminine,
dialog: so female.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: I love being female because it, how
dialog: do you say, allows me to be close to
dialog: men.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: I'm glad you're female.

speaker_heading: GABRIELLE
dialog: Anyway it's time he grew up. N'est-

speaker_heading: PUFF
dialog: I saw it, gentlemen. I saw the whole

dialog: act, and to use the vernacular, I
dialog: wanted me some of that.
text: The congressmen laugh appreciatively. The laughter is a little
text: too enthusiastic and goes on a little too long. It stops
text: abruptly.
speaker_heading: PUFF
dialog: And I think I understood from that
dialog: moment, that in order to get some, I
dialog: would have to do what they said. In
dialog: order to experience this primal,
dialog: basic, animal thing, I would first
dialog: have to become a civilized, prissy,

speaker_heading: NATHAN

speaker_heading: NATHAN

speaker_heading: LILA

speaker_heading: NATHAN

speaker_heading: LILA

speaker_heading: NATHAN

speaker_heading: NATHAN

speaker_heading: NATHAN

speaker_heading: WENDALL
dialog: I just think it might be important

speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: I love Lila. I mean, she's a wonderful
dialog: person. And... she loves me! That's
dialog: no small potatoes. I mean she really
dialog: loves me. She's sacrificed so much
dialog: to be in this relationship with me.
dialog: And she's a good person. A truly
dialog: good person. How rare is that in
dialog: this world, eh? And how could I stop
dialog: loving somebody because of a little
dialog: physical imperfection, if it can
dialog: even be called that. I mean, God
dialog: knows I'm not perfect! What about my

dialog: Lila.
text: 1) Nathan demonstrates the proper way to taste wine: sniffing

text: 2) Nathan shows Puff a flashcard which reads: "I'll start
dialog: tonight with the foie gras."
text: 3) Puff is holding up a small hand mirror and trimming nose

text: 4) Puff juggles three balls while riding a unicycle.
text: 5) Puff, dressed as Peter Pan, stands with legs spread and
text: hands on hips. He is singing "I Gotta Crow."
text: 6) Puff, dressed in an apron and chef's hat, is tossing a
dialog: salad. There are two types of vinegar to choose from. He
text: hesitates, then chooses the balsamic. Nathan and Lila applaud.
text: 7) Puff, in a smoking jacket and smoking a pipe, is sitting
text: in an easy chair, next to a fake fire and a fake sleeping

dialog: case.
speaker_heading: PUFF
dialog: Okay. That's fair.
text: Nathan unlocks the case. Puff tentatively steps out into the
text: world. He hugs Nathan. It's a grateful, obsequious, slightly
text: pathetic hug. Nathan hugs him back, but he's keeping him at
text: a distance. Puff pulls himself out of the hug, but still
text: rests his hands on Nathan's shoulders and looks him in the
text: eye, almost like a lover. Then he parts with Nathan and goes
text: over to embrace Lila. She graciously receives him. After a
text: moment in the embrace, Puff starts dry-humping Lila. Lila
text: can't get out of his clutches.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: No, Puff! Bad!
text: Nathan presses a button, which shocks Puff and sends him

speaker_heading: NATHAN

speaker_heading: LILA

speaker_heading: NATHAN

speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: So he's doing okay?
speaker_heading: NATHAN
text: Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying

speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: That's funny because, you know, I

speaker_heading: LILA

speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Nathan told my brother.
speaker_heading: LILA

speaker_heading: GABRIELLE
dialog: That's Lila?
speaker_heading: LILA

speaker_heading: LILA

speaker_heading: LILA

speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: Talking is to be kept to a minimum.

speaker_heading: LILA

text: and falls on top of her, knocking her to the ground.
text: He regains his composure, finds himself on top of Lila.
text: They look at each other for a moment. Then they kiss. It's a
text: violent kiss. They grope each other. This is primal sex now.
text: In the dirt. Sweaty. Loud grunting. Lila even presses the
text: shock button at the right moment. Puff seems to like it in
dialog: this context.

speaker_heading: NATHAN

speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: How did you know we...

speaker_heading: GABRIELLE
dialog: (sadly)
dialog: Oui.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: That bitch. I worked so hard. We
dialog: worked so hard, you and I. He would've
dialog: made us famous.
speaker_heading: GABRIELLE
dialog: We still have you and I.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: I know. And that's great. But it
dialog: would be great in a better way, not
dialog: a better way but a different way, if
dialog: I could find him and bring him back.
speaker_heading: GABRIELLE
dialog: Where do we look for little lost
dialog: Puff?
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: I have some thoughts. I think that
text: hairy bitch is somewhere trying to
text: turn him back into an ape.
speaker_heading: GABRIELLE
dialog: That is horrible. Apes are dirty.
dialog: No?
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: You better believe they're dirty!
dialog: And smelly! And messy! And they don't
dialog: know their forks from their assholes!
text: Nathan, seemingly in the grips of a sudden horrific migraine,
text: scrunches his face and holds his ears. He relaxes a bit, and
text: gets out of bed. He walks across the room, pulls on some
text: pants, and picks up a container called "Stop Buggin' Me,
dialog: Sunny."
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: I'm going alone. This could be
dialog: dangerous.
speaker_heading: GABRIELLE
dialog: (pulling covers up
dialog: and turning away

dialog: Okay, my sweet. Good night.
speaker_heading: NATHAN

speaker_heading: GABRIELLE

speaker_heading: NATHAN

speaker_heading: GABRIELLE

speaker_heading: NATHAN

scene_heading: EXT. FOREST - EVENING
text: Lila and puff are having sex again next to a campfire. Now

text: back. She stands and retrieves a sack of berries.
text: Puff and Lila greedily, gluttonously stuff their faces.
text: Lila takes some berries and smashes them against Puff's face.
text: She laughs heartily. He looks annoyed for a second, but then
text: grabs a handful and squishes them against Lila's face. Pretty

speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Aha! Finally. I've covered almost

dialog: eastern Ohio.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: Ugnh.
speaker_heading: PUFF
dialog: Ugnh.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Oh please, is that as articulate as
dialog: you can be after all the time I spent
dialog: teaching you? We've discussed
dialog: Wittgenstein, for Christ's sake. Not
dialog: that you ever had anything very
dialog: original or challenging to say on
dialog: the subject.
speaker_heading: PUFF
dialog: Unn.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Down from the tree. Both of you.
dialog: Keep your hands where I can see them.
dialog: Don't want you pulling any weapons
dialog: out of your fur.
text: Nathan laughs heartily, haughtily, at his joke as Lila and
text: Puff climb down from the tree.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Look at you two. You both disgust
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: Oook. Oook.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Shut up!
dialog: (to Puff)
dialog: I gave you... life. I created you in
dialog: my image, Puff. I took you from this
dialog: primordial ooze and brought you into
dialog: the world of culture and art and
dialog: manners. And this is how you repay
dialog: me? By heading back to the ooze first
dialog: chance you get? I should leave you
dialog: here with Lila the ape woman. It
dialog: would serve you right, you ungrateful
dialog: piece of crap. But I'm not going to.
dialog: You're too valuable to me. Totally
dialog: selfish of me. You serve my purpose.
dialog: But if you had any smarts you would
dialog: realize that I serve your purpose as
dialog: well. Life is so much more delightful
dialog: when lived in a silk suit.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: Ooka.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Don't worry, Lila. You can stay. I
dialog: don't have any interest in you
dialog: anymore.
dialog: (to Puff)
dialog: C'mon, monkey boy.
text: Puff looks at Lila. Lila shrugs helplessly. Puff reaches out
text: to touch her hand.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Now!
text: Puff looks at Lila again. She jerks her head in the direction
text: of Nathan. Puff sighs and moves to Nathan.
text: Nathan prods Puff, and they head off through the trees.
text: Suddenly Puff elbows Nathan. Nathan grunts, doubles over.
text: Puff turns, lunges, and the two wrestle on the ground.
text: Puff pries the gun from Nathan's hand, and jumps up. Nathan
text: stands also, backing away. Puff has the gun trained on Nathan.
text: Lila runs to Puff, stands behind him.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
text: Puff, put the gun down.
speaker_heading: PUFF
dialog: Ounpoo. Ungh.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Let's be reasonable human beings
dialog: here. We're all reasonable human
dialog: beings, aren't we?
speaker_heading: PUFF
dialog: (jumping up and down
dialog: like a chimp)
dialog: Unka unka unka unka unka.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Look, why don't you and Lila stay
dialog: here and have your natural life.
dialog: I'll just go on my way. You'll never
dialog: see me again.
speaker_heading: PUFF
dialog: (to Lila, guiltily)
dialog: I have to talk. Is that okay?
text: Lila nods.
speaker_heading: PUFF
dialog: (to Nathan)
dialog: You did create me in your image,
dialog: Nathan. Before you I was a simple,
dialog: happy, complete being, in harmony
dialog: with the world around me. After you
dialog: I became duplicitous, cynical, angry,
dialog: anal, totally out of touch with my
dialog: surroundings. In a word, Nathan, I
dialog: became you. Lila has reintroduced me
dialog: to myself. And, incidentally, what
dialog: I'm about to do, kill you, is
dialog: something that would never have
dialog: occurred to me to do as a creature
dialog: of the Earth. Before when I killed,
dialog: it was for food or in self-defense.
dialog: Now I will kill for revenge. Revenge
dialog: is an abstract concept, Nathan. And
dialog: I learned abstract thinking from
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: Puff, don't.
text: Puff shoots. A crow screams. The fluttering of wings. The
text: bullet hits Nathan in the head. He falls.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: LILA

scene_heading: INT. WHITE SPACE - DAY
text: Nathan talks.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Then Puff shot me. Then I died. That's
dialog: all I know. That's the end of my
dialog: story. Do I get to go to heaven now?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Or is it... hell?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Or... what?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I just stay here, is it? I just stay
dialog: here and tell it again? And after
dialog: that? Again? And after...
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: Yes. Yes, of course.
text: (sighs, clears his
dialog: throat)
text: We move into an extreme close-up.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: (beginning again)

text: Lila runs to Nathan. She kneels beside him.
speaker_heading: LILA
text: He's dead.
speaker_heading: PUFF
dialog: (calmly)
text: We bury the body. We disappear into
dialog: the woods. Nobody knows.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: (beat, then quietly)
text: No. This is the end of the road.
dialog: There's a dead human being here. For
dialog: all of his faults, he was a human
dialog: being, and certainly a victim of his
dialog: culture as much as anybody.
speaker_heading: PUFF
dialog: Forget him, Lila. We'll disappear.
dialog: We'll never talk about it again.
dialog: We'll never talk again period. I
dialog: love you.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: Puff, what happened to you is as
dialog: much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe
dialog: more so, because I knew it was wrong
dialog: and I went along with it anyway. I'm
text: taking responsibility for the murder.
dialog: I want you to go back to your old
dialog: life.
speaker_heading: PUFF
dialog: I won't let you do that. I shot the
dialog: bastard. And I'm glad.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: No. Go back to the woods. This is a
dialog: sacrifice I need to make. In my world
dialog: we have something called penance.
dialog: It's another abstraction, but I had
dialog: the concept drummed into my head
dialog: during my years in the convent. It
dialog: doesn't exist for you, and it
dialog: shouldn't. See, I could never be
dialog: free again anyway, so I might as
dialog: well be in jail.
speaker_heading: PUFF
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Then I'll live for both of us, Lila.
dialog: I'll be the most free, truest animal
dialog: in the whole forest. For both of us.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: (tearing up)
dialog: That's what I'm counting on.
speaker_heading: PUFF
dialog: (an idea)
dialog: But first I'll live among them, just
dialog: long enough to testify before congress

speaker_heading: LILA

speaker_heading: PUFF
dialog: And so, gentlemen, that is my story.
dialog: I agreed to testify before this
dialog: committee because I hoped to convey
dialog: to the American public that there is
dialog: indeed a paradise lost. Human beings
dialog: have become so enamored of their
dialog: technologies and their intellectual
text: prowess and their fancy gourmet foods,
dialog: that they've forgotten to look to
dialog: the Earth as a teacher. This is
dialog: hubris, my friends. And my story of
dialog: destruction and betrayal is proof of
dialog: that. I will keep my promise to Lila.
dialog: I will shed this suit and go back
dialog: into the wilderness. I will live out
dialog: my days naked and free.
speaker_heading: CONGRESSMAN
dialog: Thank you, sir. Your story has touched
dialog: us all deeply. We will pass some
dialog: legislation addressing this problem.
speaker_heading: PUFF
dialog: Thank you. That is all I ask.
dialog: (to camera)
dialog: Good-bye, Lila. I take you with me
dialog: in my untamed heart.
text: Puff stands and exits the auditorium. Flashbulbs flash.
text: In the prison common room, Lila wipes a tear from her eye.

text: and sees a bluebird light there, then fly away.

speaker_heading: OLDER WOMAN

speaker_heading: PUFF
dialog: Mother?
speaker_heading: OLDER WOMAN
dialog: Yes... Derek.

speaker_heading: PUFF
dialog: (formally)
dialog: It's a pleasure to meet you, mother.
dialog: But I'm an ape like dad was...
dialog: (checks watch)
dialog: And I have to go back into the woods
dialog: now... forever.
speaker_heading: OLDER WOMAN
dialog: (resigned)
dialog: Yes, I suppose so. I suppose I knew
dialog: that was going to be what you would
dialog: say. It's good to see you again
dialog: though.
speaker_heading: PUFF
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: OLDER WOMAN
dialog: I'm in the book, if you ever want to
dialog: drop me a line or something.
speaker_heading: PUFF
dialog: I'm an ape, mom. I'm an ape. And
dialog: apes don't drop lines.
text: His mother weeps. Puff gently rests his hand on her shoulder
text: for a moment, then he turns and waves to the reporters. The
text: crowd bursts into applause. Flashbulbs flash. Puff jogs into
text: the woods. There is a collective sigh, and then everyone

speaker_heading: PUFF
dialog: Arf.
text: Gabrielle kisses him again, even more passionately this time
speaker_heading: PUFF
dialog: As much as I loved Nathan, I'm not

dialog: thing to say, my sweet?
speaker_heading: GABRIELLE
dialog: (putting her finger
