scene_heading: EXT. EMPTY LOT - NEAR DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - DUSK
text: The lights of downtown L.A. twinkle in the distance. PETER
text: KLAVEN, late 20s-early 30s, nice looking, approachable,
text: stands in front of a fenced in lot with his attractive
text: girlfriend, ZOOEY RICE, same age, a little artsier-looking.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: So, my plan is to build a cluster
text: of live-work lofts around the
dialog: perimeter here, and then create
dialog: this really neighborhoody retail
dialog: and dining area in the central
dialog: square here. I even thought maybe
dialog: you and Hailey and Denise could
dialog: open up another location of your
dialog: store.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: Really? Denise keeps talking about
text: wanting to open another branch.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: It'd be great. The land is a
dialog: little pricey, so, I won’t be able
dialog: to develop it right away, but, when
dialog: I sell the Ferrigno Estate, I
dialog: figured out, I’1ll at least be able
dialog: to put a down payment on it, and
dialog: still have enough money left over
dialog: for the reception in Santa Barbara.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: Peter, what are you talking about?
dialog: What reception?
text: Beat. Peter pulls a small JEWELRY BOX from his blazer. A
text: look of realization washes over Zooey’s face.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I know it’s only been eight months,
dialog: but, I am madly, insanely,
dialog: ridiculously in love with you.
text: He opens the box, revealing a lovely DIAMOND ENGAGEMENT RING.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: Will you marry me?
text: Off her look of complete, utter happiness...
scene_heading: INT. PETER’S CAR - NIGHT
text: Peter drives. Zooey is in the passenger seat, glowing. She
text: speaks over the car’s BLUETOOTH SPEAKERPHONE with one of her
text: two best friends, HAILEY.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: ...it just happened like two
dialog: minutes ago. Hailey, can you
dialog: believe it?!
speaker_heading: HAILEY (0.S.)
dialog: How have I been on like ten million
dialog: dates and you end up marrying some
dialog: totally awesome guy who randomly
dialog: walks into our store?!
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: (quietly, to Peter)
text: Doesn’t realize she’s on speaker...
dialog: (into car microphone)
dialog: Will you conference in Denise?
speaker_heading: HAILEY (0.S.)
dialog: Hold on.
text: Zooey grabs Peter’s hand as she waits...
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: That piece of land is perfect.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I’m so excited you like it. The
dialog: neighborhood is like, two years
dialog: away from taking off, but--
text: DENISE, Zooey’s other best friend, comes on the line.
speaker_heading: DENISE (0.S.)
dialog: I cannot fucking believe you didn’t
dialog: call me first.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: You are such a freak! Hailey’s
dialog: before you in my speed dial!
speaker_heading: DENISE (0.S.)
dialog: I’m kidding. Zooey, oh my god! I
dialog: am so psyched for you it is
dialog: disgusting. Hold on, Barry goes
dialog: crazy if I’m in the house during
dialog: his poker night.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: DENISE (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: (to her husband)
dialog: Give me a second you fat douchebag.
dialog: Zooey just got engaged. Peter.
dialog: You’ve met him twenty times, dum-
dialog: dum.
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Sorry, Zo. So, did you guys pick a
dialog: date?
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: June 30th in Santa Barbara. Peter
dialog: already booked that place Bacara
dialog: where we went for that long
dialog: weekend.
speaker_heading: HAILEY (0.S.)
dialog: Oh, he is so sweet. Wait, is
dialog: Bacara the one where you guys slept
dialog: together for the first time?
speaker_heading: DENISE (0.S.)
dialog: No, wasn’t that in the hot tub in
dialog: Mexico?
speaker_heading: HAILEY (0.S.)
dialog: That’s right. It was Mexico.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You told them about the hot tub?
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: Maybe. I don’t remember.
speaker_heading: HAILEY (0.S.)
dialog: Wow, so June 30th?
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: I mean, it’s soon, but--
speaker_heading: DENISE (0.S.)
dialog: Who cares? Peter’s a doll, and he
dialog: goes down on you six nights a week.
dialog: What the hell are you waiting for?
text: Peter looks at Zooey in disbelief.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: You’re right. It’s gonna be great.
dialog: I gotta go. I’11 call you later.
dialog: Love you.
speaker_heading: HAILEY (0.S.) DENISE (0.S.)
dialog: Love you! So fucking psyched for you!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: How do they know so much about our
dialog: sex life?
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: Hailey and Denise are my best
dialog: friends in the world. Girls share
dialog: stuff like that.
dialog: As Peter considers this...
speaker_heading: ZOOEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Ah! We're engaged! I’m so
dialog: excited!
text: She kisses him passionately, as we go to...
scene_heading: EXT. PETER AND ZOOEY’S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Hand in hand, Zooey and Peter walk towards their cozy
text: bungalow in the Silverlake section of L.A.. Zooey’s on her
dialog: cell-phone.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: ..--I know, he’s the best. I feel
dialog: so lucky.
dialog: (quietly, to Peter)
text: It’s Debbie. She’s freaking out.
dialog: (back to phone)
dialog: Alright, I gotta call Lisa, call me
dialog: later, okay? Love you, bye.
text: They enter the house.
scene_heading: INT. PETER AND ZOOEY’S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: It’s decorated in a minimalist way with cool, eclectic
text: furniture and knickknacks. Zooey is on the phone with
dialog: another friend.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: .--love you too, Lisa. Talk to you
dialog: tomorrow.
text: She hangs up. Turns to Peter.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m sorry, sweetie, I’m totally
text: hogging the phone.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No, that’s fine. I just want to
dialog: give my parents a call.
scene_heading: THE LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Peter speaks with his mom, JOYCE, on speakerphone.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: .--Mom, what do you think she
dialog: said?! She said yes!
speaker_heading: JOYCE (0.S.)
dialog: Oh, honey, I’m so thrilled for you.
dialog: And you did it in front of that
dialog: piece of land like we talked about?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yes, she loved it. Thanks, that
dialog: was such a good idea.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: I didn’t know that was her idea.
dialog: Thank you, Joyce!
text: In the b.g., the sound of MEN EXULTING.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Dad sounds really excited. You
dialog: told him?
speaker_heading: JOYCE (0.S.)
dialog: Actually, he and Robbie are
dialog: watching some kind of boxing
dialog: program.
text: Peter’s father, OSWALD “OZ” KLAVEN shouts out...
speaker_heading: OZ (0.S.)
dialog: Ultimate Fighting!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Do they want to get on the phone?
speaker_heading: JOYCE (0.S.)
dialog: I’m sure. Hold on, honey.
dialog: (after a moment)
dialog: Apparently, they’re in the middle
dialog: of the game, sweetheart. But they
dialog: say congratulations.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh, okay. No prob. Alright, well,
dialog: we'll talk to you tomorrow.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: Bye, Joyce!
speaker_heading: JOYCE (0.S.)
dialog: Kids... I’m thrilled. Goodnight.
text: She hangs up.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: Was that weird that your dad and
dialog: brother didn’t want to pick up?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No, I’m sure they’1l call back.
dialog: Wow, I am exhausted. Getting
dialog: engaged is intense. You want to go
dialog: up to bed?
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: It’s only nine. You don’t want to
dialog: call any of your friends?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Nah, I’1l make some calls tomorrow.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: Really? You don’t want to call
dialog: that guy Tevin? Don’t you speak
dialog: like twenty times a day?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yeah, but, he’s more like a co-
text: worker than a friend.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: Or Gil, from your fencing club?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: He’s not really a ‘Call right away
dialog: to tell him the news’ kind of
dialog: friend.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: So, who do you consider your
dialog: closest friends?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Uh, you know there’s a bunch of
dialog: guys. Samir Patel, my freshman
dialog: roommate from UCLA.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: I’ve never heard you mention him.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No? One Beer Samir? We’re pretty
dialog: tight. You’re right, I should give
text: him a ring.
scene_heading: THE LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATER
text: Peter’s on the phone. Zooey putters around in the b.g.,
text: pretending not to be paying attention.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Hey, Samir? It’s Peter... Peter
dialog: Klaven. Yeah, man, I guess it’s
dialog: been a little while. You been
dialog: good? Great, well, I just wanted
dialog: you to know that I got engaged
dialog: tonight, so, we’re getting married
dialog: in three months and... Samir, no, I
dialog: didn’t bail on your wedding, I
dialog: just, I couldn’t make it. I
dialog: thought I sent a gift though... no?
dialog: Oh, well... I’m sorry, man. I
dialog: didn’t know you were so... okay,
dialog: right, you take care as well.
text: He hangs up. Looks at Zooey.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: When’s the last time you spoke to
dialog: him?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I guess it was a couple years ago.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: Why didn’t you go to his wedding?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I wanted to, but, I promised
dialog: Lindsay I'd go to her family
dialog: reunion that weekend.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: And he’s your closest friend?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: He’s... no, I have a bunch of good
dialog: friends. I have the guys from my
dialog: fencing club. There’s Bob Loden.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: Your chiropractor?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: He’s a great guy. Honestly, I
dialog: think Samir has a drinking problem.
dialog: He must've forgotten how close we
dialog: were.
dialog: (off her skeptical look)
dialog: Don’t look at me like that. I have
dialog: friends. Just ‘cause they don’t
dialog: call me every two seconds like
dialog: Hailey and Denise, doesn’t mean
dialog: they don’t exist.
scene_heading: EXT. PETER’S PARENTS’ (THE KLAVEN’S) HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Peter and Zooey stand at the front door. JOYCE KLAVEN,
text: hugs Peter. Then Zooey. Ad libs her congratulations.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Where’s Dad?
speaker_heading: JOYCE
dialog: In the den. Robbie gave him this
dialog: Nintendo Wee or Wah, who knows
dialog: what, for Father’s Day. They’re
dialog: obsessed.
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Boys, Peter and Zooey are here!
speaker_heading: 0Z (0.S.)
dialog: Out in a minute! I’m about to kick
dialog: your son’s ass in Tiger Woods!
scene_heading: INT. THE KLAVEN’S HOUSE - NIGHT
dialog: 50s,
text: Peter and Zooey sit around the dining room table with Joyce,
text: Peter’s soft-spoken but macho, guy’s-guy father, OZ, as well
text: as his cute, gay younger brother, ROBBIE.
speaker_heading: JOYCE
dialog: ...did Peter have any good friends
dialog: growing up?
text: She looks to Oz, who shakes his head.
speaker_heading: JOYCE (CONT'D)
dialog: I honestly don’t seem to remember
dialog: any.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Zooey, just to clarify here, Dad
dialog: worked for IBM. We moved every
dialog: eighteen months.
speaker_heading: OZ
dialog: Robbie always managed to have
dialog: friends. I mean, he probably
dialog: wanted to suck their dicks, but--
speaker_heading: JOYCE
dialog: Oswald!
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Mom, he’s actually kind of got a
dialog: point.
speaker_heading: JOYCE
dialog: Well, he still doesn’t need to use
dialog: that language. The point is,
dialog: Zooey, Peter always connected with
dialog: women.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: I can see that. He’s a great
dialog: boyfriend.
speaker_heading: OZ
dialog: Also, you need to remember that he
text: matured sexually at a very young
dialog: age. I remember taking him
dialog: swimming when he was twelve, the
dialog: kid had a bush like a forty year
dialog: old Serbian.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Dad, please stop speaking.
speaker_heading: JOYCE
dialog: No, but, you always had a
dialog: girlfriend, as far back as I can
dialog: remember.
speaker_heading: OZ
dialog: He wasn’t a guy’s guy. Your
dialog: brother here is into video games,
dialog: fishing, we golf together...
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What are you talking about? I play
dialog: sports.
speaker_heading: OZ
dialog: You prance around in tights with a
dialog: sword. It’s not a sport.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Oh, snap!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I’m a competitive fencer. It’s in
dialog: the Olympic Games!
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: Oz, you two didn’t do father-son
dialog: stuff together when Peter was a
dialog: kid?
speaker_heading: OZ
dialog: Almost never. He spent all his
dialog: time hanging out with his mother or
text: circling real estate listings.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I was nurturing an interest that
dialog: became my career.
speaker_heading: OZ
dialog: A woman's career.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: There’s plenty of male real estate
dialog: agents.
speaker_heading: OZ
dialog: It’s just something of a faggoty
dialog: job, that’s all.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: “Faggoty?!” You can’t use that
dialog: word!
speaker_heading: OZ
dialog: Yes, I can. Robbie gave me
dialog: permission.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Dad loves the gays. I made him an
dialog: honorary homo last week.
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Guys, this is ridiculous. Why is
dialog: it weird that I had girlfriends?
speaker_heading: OZ
dialog: We're just saying you never had a
dialog: best friend. That’s all.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Who’s your best friend?
speaker_heading: OZ
dialog: I have two. Hank Mardukas has been
dialog: my closest friend in the world
dialog: since our first year at IBM, he was
dialog: Best Man at my wedding, we speak
dialog: three times a week for the past
dialog: thirty years. And then, there’s
dialog: Robbie.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Robbie is your other best friend?
speaker_heading: OZ
dialog: Correct. And Hank Mardukas.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Zooey, here’s the deal. Peter’s a
dialog: girlfriend guy. Okay? Girlfriend
dialog: guy’s never have good male friends
dialog: because they put all their energy
dialog: into their girlfriends so their
dialog: male friendships fall by the
text: wayside.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Zooey, don’t listen to him. Robbie
dialog: barely knows me.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Peter, I happen to be an expert on
dialog: men, and I know it’s true. We are
dialog: who we are.
speaker_heading: OZ
dialog: Well put, son. We are who we are.
dialog: Look, you think I was happy when
dialog: Robbie told us he was a flamer? Of
dialog: course not, but, I got used to the
dialog: idea that he craved a wiener in his
text: caboose after about five minutes,
dialog: and the truth is he’s cool as hell.
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Dad, I actually prefer to be the
dialog: top.
speaker_heading: OZ
dialog: I know you do, pal, I’m speaking
text: metaphorically here.
speaker_heading: JOYCE
dialog: Alright, that’s enough. Come on,
dialog: let’s clear the table.
text: Peter stands up to help his mom.
speaker_heading: OZ
dialog: See?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I can’t help Mom with the dishes?
speaker_heading: OZ
dialog: Do you see Robbie and me lifting a
dialog: finger?
dialog: (points to him and Robbie)
dialog: Guy’s guys.
text: Peter looks very unhappy.
scene_heading: INT. PETER AND ZOOEY’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: The newly engaged couple get ready for bed.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You know what? I completely
dialog: forgot. I do have a best friend.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: Who’s that, sweetie?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: Peter, I’m your girlfriend--
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Fiance.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: Fiance, whatever. I don’t want to
dialog: be your best friend.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Don’t get me wrong... I love you.
dialog: It’s just different.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You don’t feel like you can be open
dialog: and honest with me? I thought we
dialog: talk about everything.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: We talk about almost everything.
dialog: There’s just certain things I talk
dialog: about with Hailey and Denise that I
dialog: could never... it’s just different,
dialog: that’s all.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Well, I guess I don’t have any
dialog: close male friends. So, do you not
dialog: want to marry me anymore?
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: Of course not. I really don’t
dialog: care. I just want you to be happy,
dialog: that’s all.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I’m very happy. It’s not like this
dialog: is something I’ve been missing.
text: Peter takes a ZANTAC from a bottle on his night-table
text: Swallows it with some water.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: What’s wrong? Your acid reflux?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: A little bit. It’s fine.
text: They get into bed.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: I’m just thinking, for the
dialog: ceremony, I want a bunch of
dialog: Bridesmaids up there, plus my Maid
dialog: of Honor...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Right...
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: But if I have six girls standing
dialog: with me, and you don’t have anyone,
dialog: it might seem a bit uneven, no?
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you thinking Robbie might be
dialog: your Best Man?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Robbie? No. Like I said, we’re
dialog: really not close.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: You know what, don’t worry about
dialog: it. We'll figure something out.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Oooh, it’s my turn to host Ladies
dialog: Night tomorrow.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No prob. I have fencing practice.
dialog: I‘ll go for a drink with the guys
dialog: afterwards.
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: I’m telling you, those dudes are my
dialog: friends.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: I know, baby.
text: They start kissing. Things are heating up, when... the phone
text: rings. Zooey turns on her bedside light, picks up the phone,
text: eyeing the Caller I.D..
speaker_heading: ZOOEY (CONT'D)
text: It’s Hailey. She had a blind date.
dialog: I‘ll be two seconds. I just want
dialog: to make sure she’s okay.

scene_heading: MAIN OFFICE AREA - MOMENTS LATER
text: As Peter heads towards his desk, he passes the cubicle of a
text: handsome, cheesy guy named TEVIN DOWNEY -- perma-tan, blonde
text: streaks in his hair. He is cracking up from something on his
text: computer when he looks up.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What’s so funny?
speaker_heading: TEVIN
dialog: One of the guys in my fantasy
dialog: football league sent me a Quicktime
dialog: of a grandma riding a Sybian
text: machine.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I don’t know what that is?
speaker_heading: TEVIN
dialog: It’s a vibrating saddle that women
dialog: sit on to give them super-intense
dialog: orgasms. Check this out.
text: Peter looks at the monitor. And winces.
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: TEVIN (CONT'D)
dialog: How sick is that?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Very. That is very sick.
speaker_heading: TEVIN
dialog: So, what up, Dog? How’s the
dialog: Ferrigno dealio coming?
speaker_heading: PETER
text: Coming good. Getting ready for the
dialog: Open House in a couple weeks.
speaker_heading: TEVIN
dialog: It’s a big piece of house, so, if
dialog: you want a co-pilot on this one,
dialog: let me know, okay? Be happy to
dialog: team up, help you “Git R Done.”
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What does that mean, “Git R Done?”
speaker_heading: TEVIN
dialog: Larry the Cable Guy? The hilarious
dialog: comedian?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh, yeah, I don’t really know his
dialog: stuff. Anyway, I think I got it
dialog: under control, but thanks for the
dialog: offer.

scene_heading: INT. FENCING GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

speaker_heading: FENCER #1
dialog: Nice job stealing my tempo there,

dialog: pretty well.
speaker_heading: FENCER #2
dialog: Anybody seen my Manchette?
speaker_heading: FENCER #1
dialog: Under your Plastron, dickweed.
text: They jostle with each other -- the way men do in a locker
text: room. Another fencer, GIL, talks to Peter.
speaker_heading: GIL
dialog: I told my cousin the open house is
dialog: a week from Saturday, right?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yeah, it’s gonna be great. I
dialog: appreciate you hooking me up with
dialog: him, Gil. It’s a really big deal
dialog: for me.
speaker_heading: GIL
dialog: You sold me my house, right?
dialog: You're the most honest real estate
dialog: agent I know.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Thanks. And look, I know you’re
dialog: the middle-man here, but, if your
dialog: cousin has any questions, he should
dialog: feel free to call me.
speaker_heading: GIL
dialog: I will let him know.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Great. So, you guys want to get
dialog: some grub? Or, grab a beer or
dialog: something?
text: The fencers exchange uncomfortable looks.
speaker_heading: FENCER #1
dialog: We're actually, uh, we’re driving
dialog: up to Joshua Tree tonight.
speaker_heading: PETER

dialog: Um, it’s like three... twenty five.
dialog: I managed to rope these boys into

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Very, very cool.
text: Awkward beat. Then...
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: I would've invited you, but, you
dialog: never really come out with us after

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Dude, don’t sweat it. Seriously,
dialog: no worries. It’s funny, I just got
dialog: engaged myself.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: That’s great, Peter. Your fiance
dialog: designs book jackets, right?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No, that was Heather, she was a
dialog: couple of girlfriends ago. Zooey
dialog: owns a home furnishing store in
dialog: Silverlake.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: Awesome, man. Good luck with that.
speaker_heading: GIL
dialog: Alright, we have a long drive. We

scene_heading: INT. PETER’S HOME OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Peter is on his computer. ON THE SCREEN -- he works on the
text: online listing for a spectacular, MODERN HOUSE in the
text: Hollywood Hills. He fiddles with the layout and description.
text: The sound of female laughter is audible O.S..
scene_heading: INT. PETER AND ZOOEY’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Peter prepares a tray of ROOT BEER FLOATS for the ladies. As
text: he does, he looks out the kitchen window, sees his MALE
text: NEIGHBOR in his house across the way -- watching a BASKETBALL
text: GAME with his FRIENDS. They all react as Kobe dunks.
scene_heading: INT. PETER AND ZOOEY’S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Zooey hangs out with a circle of LADIES, including HAILEY,
text: single and miserable about it, and DENISE, caustic and
dialog: married.
speaker_heading: LADY #1
dialog: He didn’t make any friends at UCLA?
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: He lived alone after freshman year.
speaker_heading: LADY #2
dialog: Ooh. The ones who lived alone
dialog: we're always the biggest
dialog: freakazoids.
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: Peter’s not a freakazoid. He had a
dialog: serious girlfriend all through
dialog: college.
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: Look, we’re not saying he’s a
dialog: freakazoid, but the truth is, for
dialog: the future of your marriage, it’s a
dialog: little troubling. If Barry didn’t
dialog: have any friends I’d shoot myself
text: in the face.
text: The ladies laugh. BY THE DOOR TO THE KITCHEN, Peter is about
text: to interrupt when he just stops... and LISTENS.
speaker_heading: DENISE (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m serious. You know what my
dialog: favorite nights are? Hanging out
dialog: with you guys. And I can do it
dialog: guilt free because Barry loves
text: hanging out with his friends too.
dialog: Every month there’s a golf weekend,
dialog: a ski-trip, a weekend in Vegas.
speaker_heading: LADY #1
dialog: You let him go to Vegas? Aren’t
dialog: you worried he’s cheating on you?
speaker_heading: DENISE
text: He’s forty pounds overweight with a
text: Jew-fro and a small dick.
dialog: (off their looks/laughter)
dialog: I love the guy to death, but I’m
text: far and away the best looking woman
dialog: he’s gonna get, and I’m just a
dialog: seven.
dialog: ALL THE LADIES
dialog: Come on! You are so not a seven!
dialog: You’re hot!
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: I know, I totally think I’m higher
dialog: than a seven! I was testing you
dialog: bitches!
speaker_heading: HAILEY
dialog: So, who’s going to be his Best Man?
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: I have no idea. I really think his
dialog: Mom might be his closest friend.
dialog: 21.
text: The ladies react to/shudder at the thought of this.
speaker_heading: LADY #2
dialog: This is a serious issue, Zo. Guys
dialog: without friends can be super-
text: clingy.
speaker_heading: LADY #3
dialog: My dad had no friends. It was
dialog: awful. He dragged my mom to all
dialog: these football games. She hated
dialog: it. That’s a big reason why they
dialog: got divorced.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: Look, the truth is, I’m freaking
dialog: out, you guys! I know, I’m
dialog: horrible for feeling this, but, I
dialog: can’t believe I’m marrying someone
dialog: who has no friends!
text: Peter motions to turn back around when he makes a noise.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Peter?
text: Peter opens the swinging door between the kitchen and the
text: rest of the house... holding the tray of root beer floats.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh, hey, I just made you guys some
text: Root Beer Floats.
text: The ladies greet Peter, ad lib -- thanking him,
text: congratulating him on the engagement. Then...
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: I thought you were going out with
dialog: your fencing team?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yeah, they couldn’t make it, so, I
dialog: just came back here. Don’t worry,
dialog: I’ve been in my office working.
dialog: I’m not even here. Bye, ladies.
text: He sets down the floats. Starts to exit.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: Thanks for the floats, baby. That
dialog: was really sweet.
text: He waves, disappears.
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Holy shit! You think he heard us?
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: Definitely not.
text: The ladies all shake their heads, trying to convince
dialog: themselves.
scene_heading: INT. PETER’S HOME OFFICE —- CONTINUOUS

text: TRAINER. He walks with a concerned looking Peter.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: You need to find a Best Man for
dialog: your wedding?! What are you, ina
dialog: John Hughes movie?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I know, it sounds ridiculous, but,
dialog: Zooey is really upset about this
dialog: friend thing. You said at dinner
dialog: you know all about men. I don’t
dialog: know where else to turn.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: This is so exciting, you coming to
dialog: me for help. The good news is, not
dialog: only do I know about men, but
dialog: straight guys are my specialty.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What does that mean?
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: I get bored pursuing gay guys.
dialog: When you’re cute and fit, you can
dialog: pretty much have any fag you want.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I like to set my sights on straight
dialog: guys to give myself more of a
dialog: challenge.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Does it work?
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Peter, I get more butt-pussy from
dialog: straight guys than you could ever
dialog: imagine.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Just... please don’t ever use that
dialog: term with me again.
text: Robbie walks up to a bench press where a GUY is struggling
text: with a bar-bell. Robbie adopts more of a straight-guy voice.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Come on! Push it out! It’s all
dialog: you! I’m not even helping! Little
dialog: further! There you go!
text: The guy looks up at Robbie appreciatively.
scene_heading: BENCH PRESS GUY
dialog: Thanks, man.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: No worries. I’11 see you around.
scene_heading: BENCH PRESS GUY
dialog: I hope so.
text: Robbie and the guy exchange smiles.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: That guy was totally flirting with
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: I know, and did you see the wedding
dialog: ring? Straight as an arrow. I’m
dialog: telling you, hooking up is easy.
text: Meeting platonic male friends, not
dialog: so much.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Why is that?
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Several reasons. First off, at
dialog: your age, most men are settled into
dialog: their groups of friends. Either
dialog: they have friends from high school,
dialog: college, or work. As time goes on,
dialog: the straight ones get married,
dialog: spend time with their wives and
dialog: kids, even their old male
text: friendships tend to fall off. The
dialog: single guys could care less about
dialog: finding new male friends unless
dialog: it’s a wing-man who can help them
dialog: pick up girls. So, you’ve set
dialog: yourself a high bar. It can be
dialog: done, but, ‘tain’t gonna be easy.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Alright, so, what do I do?
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: We have to put the word out on the
dialog: street that you’re available. I’11
text: do some recon around the gym, but
dialog: you need to be aggressive about
dialog: this. Every man is a potential
dialog: suitor. You see a guy on the
text: street, strike up a conversation.
dialog: Ask him on a man-date. By that, I
dialog: mean a casual lunch or after-work
dialog: drink. No dinner and no movies.
dialog: You’re not taking these guys to see
scene_heading: THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA, understand?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yes. Keep it casual.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Men are very sensitive about
dialog: meeting new friends. Why? Because
text: they’re all secretly afraid that
dialog: they’re gay, and half of them are.
dialog: So, they overcompensate by being
text: emotionally distant and guarded.
text: An incredibly STRAIGHT-SEEMING GUY walks by, exchanges
text: “Hey’s” with Robbie.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Let me guess, you slept with that
dialog: guy?
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: No, but he gave me a handjob in the
dialog: steam room last week. It was
dialog: terrible, ‘cause his fingers were
text: all calloused from weightlifting.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: See, this is why we don’t hang out.
dialog: You're disgusting.
text: Robbie shrugs, unfazed.

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Ooh, so painful.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: Way to put this on your Netflix
dialog: cue, baby.
text: Peter walks to the TV, ejects the DVD.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: So, I know this might sound weird,
dialog: but I’m going to try to meet
text: someone before the wedding.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: A friend. So, if you, or any of
dialog: your zillion girlfriends have any
dialog: candidates, I just want you to
dialog: know, I’m available.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: You’re so ridiculous. You're going
dialog: to try and meet a friend?
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Why not? I want a Best Man up
dialog: there with me. I don’t want to
dialog: look like a big loser when you have
dialog: twenty eight bridesmaids, and I
dialog: can’t even get One Beer Samir to
dialog: show up on my end.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: I know you’re just doing this for
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yeah, but, I really love you, so,
dialog: it kind of feels good.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: I am so happy you walked into our

text: She kisses him.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You wanna try and do it before

speaker_heading: ZOOEY

speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: (points to the Hollywood

dialog: You were wasting your time with

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Why do you say that?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: I saw that guy pulling in. He
dialog: drives a Volkswagon Passat. That's
dialog: a thirty thousand dollar car, and
dialog: he’s looking at a 4.3 million
dialog: dollar house? Doesn’t compute. He
dialog: hasn’t been dating the girl he’s

speaker_heading: SYDNEY

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: And you can make a living doing
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: I’m not exactly flying private, but
dialog: yeah, I do nicely. The thing I ask
dialog: myself, is, can I afford my
dialog: lifestyle? If the answer is yes,
dialog: I’m happy. The Europeans have it
dialog: right... they work to live, not the
dialog: other way around. I tend to adhere
dialog: to a more Continental way of
dialog: thinking.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You’re right, in America, you’re

speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: You ever been to Italy?

speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I can’t just call him.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Don’t be such a pussy. He gave you
dialog: his card. Of course you can.
dialog: The sound is awful.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: And say what? ‘Oh, hey, Sydney,
dialog: you want to get dinner with me?’ I
dialog: hate this. There’s no rules for
dialog: male friendships.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: What is the big deal? You went out
dialog: with all those other guys?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Those were set-ups. This is
dialog: completely different.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Fine, then wait around for him to
dialog: call. And if he does, no more
dialog: dinners, okay? It’s sending the
dialog: wrong message.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I know. Actually, that guy, Doug
dialog: who kissed me, he’s really great.
dialog: You want his number?
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: No, he’s gay. I told you, I’m not
dialog: into that.

speaker_heading: PETER

dialog: (turns to Robbie)
dialog: By the way, I can’t thank you
dialog: enough for setting me up with that

dialog: We met at an Open House last week.
dialog: Anyway, I was just checking in,

speaker_heading: HAILEY
dialog: «+.SO, we go back to his house.
dialog: We're kissing. It’s getting a
dialog: little heated, I’m like, ‘Okay, I’m
dialog: gonna have sex for the first time
dialog: in three months. That’s cool.’
text: Then, he rolls over, opens a drawer
text: in his night-table... proceeds to
text: pull out a huge strap-on dildo.
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: What’s the deal, he’s a pre-op
dialog: tranny?
speaker_heading: HAILEY
dialog: No, he is a man, and what he asks
dialog: me to do, in a very casual tone,
dialog: is, strap on the fake penis, and,
dialog: uh, screw him with it, in his butt.
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: By the way, you may not be into
dialog: that, but, I don’t think it
dialog: necessarily makes him gay.
speaker_heading: HAILEY
dialog: It was a first date, Denise! Who
dialog: requests that on a first date?!
text: Peter enters the store.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: Hey! What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I was downtown meeting with the
dialog: owner of my development site.
dialog: Thought I’d say hi on my way back
text: to the office.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: You just missed Hailey telling us
dialog: how a guy she met on J-Date wanted
text: her to do him with a strap-on.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Ah.
speaker_heading: HAILEY
dialog: So, that was my Wednesday night.
dialog: How's your man-search coming?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: About the same as yours. It’s
dialog: tough, there’s not a lot of great

speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: Barry said he and his friends had a

dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (skeptical)
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: No. I guess you took all their

text: Peter’s cell-phone rings. He steps away, answers it.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Peter Klaven... yes, right,
dialog: Sydney. Good to hear from you.
dialog: This afternoon? Uh, yeah, sure, I
dialog: can do that. Father’s Office at 5.
dialog: See you in a jiff.
text: He hangs up.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: See you in a jiff?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I know. I’ve never said that
dialog: expression in my life.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: Baby, you’re all flustered. Who
dialog: was that?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: This guy I met at my Open House,
dialog: Sydney something....
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: Oh my god! Peter’s gota
dialog: boyfriend!
speaker_heading: HAILEY
dialog: This is insane! How did you get a

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I don’t have a boyfriend. We're

dialog: about real estate.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: Don’t forget, we’re having dinner
dialog: with Denise and Barry and Debbie
dialog: and Max.
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yup. Edendale Grill at 8.
speaker_heading: HAILEY
dialog: Guys, what the hell?
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: HAILEY
dialog: You can’t make a dinner plan
dialog: without me. We have an unspoken
dialog: pact about stuff like this.
speaker_heading: DENISE
text: It’s a boring couple’s dinner.
speaker_heading: HAILEY
dialog: Oh, so, because I’m single, I
text: suddenly have the Ebola Virus.
text: Peter quietly watches these friends interact...
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: You don’t have Ebola, we just
dialog: didn’t think you’d want to come.
speaker_heading: HAILEY
dialog: I’m your best friend. You don’t
dialog: think I’d at least want to know?
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: I thought I’m your best friend?
speaker_heading: HAILEY
dialog: Zooey and I have been best friends
dialog: since sixth grade. We didn’t meet
dialog: you till college, and you weren't
dialog: even undergrad with us.
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: So fucking what?
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: Guys, this is ridiculous.
speaker_heading: HAILEY
dialog: Wait a minute, which one of us is
dialog: your best friend?
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: I love you both. I’m not gonna
dialog: choose.
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: Well, you can’t have two Maids of

dialog: have to decide.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: I’m gonna take off.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: (waves, then, to Hailey)
dialog: Why don’t you just come to dinner?
speaker_heading: HAILEY
dialog: I can’t. I’m going out with the

dialog: What? We had a really nice time,

speaker_heading: SYDNEY

dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Lindsay? We were right there on
dialog: the marriage track, but, then I
text: found out she was a kleptomaniac.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Oof. Those are the worst.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yeah, she shoplifted from stores,
dialog: from my parents’ house. One time
dialog: we went to Disneyland with her
dialog: nephews, she got busted for
dialog: stealing a case of Mickey Mouse
dialog: golf balls.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: She was a golfer?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: A golfer? No, you’re missing the
dialog: point. She was a thief.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Yeah, no, I get it. I’ve just
dialog: always wondered if having a
dialog: girlfriend who could join you for
dialog: eighteen would be a blessing or a
dialog: curse. Anyway, go on...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Right, so, when it started getting
dialog: really out of control, I called it
dialog: off, and, I literally met Zooey the
dialog: day after we split up.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Really? No laj in between the vag?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What does that mean?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: You didn’t have any lag time
dialog: between women?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I didn’t plan it that way, but, it
dialog: just happened. Zooey’s super
dialog: smart, we’re both really into
dialog: architecture, home design.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: I swear, we can make an entire

dialog: the photos in the latest issue of
dialog: Metropolitan Home.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: How's the sex?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: You’re going to be making love to
dialog: one woman for the rest of your
dialog: life. So, is it good?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: That’s kind of private, you know?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Not really. It’s something we all
dialog: think about on a minute by minute
dialog: basis, but, we’re not supposed to
dialog: talk about it? Why?
text: Beat. Peter thinks about this.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You’re right. I guess, no one’s
dialog: ever asked me the question, that’s
dialog: all. The sex is good. Very good.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Your voice when up when you said
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: So what?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: It means, you weren't being
dialog: entirely truthful. What’s the
dialog: deal?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I don’t know, I guess at times, I
dialog: wish she enjoyed, you know...
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Getting in it the tush?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What?! No. Oral sex.
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: She doesn’t like it when you go
dialog: down on her?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No, that she likes. It’s the other
dialog: way, she doesn’t seem to... what am
dialog: I doing? Sydney, I barely know
dialog: you. Look, Zooey’s an awesome
dialog: woman, we have a great sex life. I
dialog: don’t know why I said that.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: ‘Cause you're speaking honestly.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What about you? Are you single?
dialog: Married?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Iwas. I got devoed a year ago.
dialog: We started out great, but, Leanne
dialog: got too needy. Never gave me my
dialog: space. I finally said ‘enough.’
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I’m sorry. Divorce sounds really
dialog: tough.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: It was rough for a while, but, the
dialog: truth is, Pistol, I’ve never been

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What does that mean, ‘Pistol?’

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No, but--
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
text: Butt cheeks. He was a struggling
dialog: novelist who wrote a book that he
dialog: knew was gonna drive the Ayatollah
dialog: crazy, get him a ton of publicity
text: in the process, and sure enough,
text: the guy puts a fatwa on his head.
dialog: Next thing you know, he’s an
dialog: international celebrity, writing
dialog: songs with Bono, he marries the hot
dialog: chick from Top Chef, lives like a
dialog: king in some four star London
dialog: hotel... on the government’s dime.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (cracking up)
dialog: So you’re saying he wanted the
dialog: death threat on his life?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Wanted it? The man loved every

text: A SIREN behind them flashes onto their car.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh shit! Sydney, this is bad, I’m
dialog: sure I’m over the legal limit.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No, don’t say anything! You have a

speaker_heading: SYDNEY

text: Peter pulls the car over. A COP approaches.
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Excuse me. You have any idea how

speaker_heading: PETER

dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Actually, you were going forty

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Got it. Whatever you need to do,

speaker_heading: COP
dialog: You gentlemen been drinking this
dialog: evening?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Yes, we have, friend.
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: We had a few pints at a bar in
dialog: Santa Monica. My buddy’s wife just
dialog: left him for a Mexican guy. He
text: walked in on the two of them
text: banging in his laundry room.
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: If that’s not bad enough, she tells
dialog: him she’s taking the kids, all the
text: savings, moving down to freakin’
dialog: Guadalajara with this yag-off. So,
dialog: I dragged my man out, got hima
text: little toasted to try to balm the
dialog: pain. He’s probably one drink over
dialog: the limit, two-max.
dialog: Beat. Then...
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Fucking Mexicans.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: You said something there, my
dialog: brother. Steal our jobs. Steal
dialog: our women. Where does it end?
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: I don’t know, friend. I do not
dialog: know. Just, keep it under the
dialog: speed limit, okay, fella. Hope

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I do too. Thanks, officer.

text: time in a minute.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: My wife ran off with a Mexican
dialog: guy?! Where the hell did you get
dialog: that?!
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
text: The cop had an indentation where
dialog: his wedding ring used to be, so I
dialog: figured the cheating spouse angle
dialog: was a good bet. The Mexican part,
dialog: was an assumption that he was a
text: racist, based on his buzz-cut,
dialog: vocal intonation, and general
dialog: demeanor.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Sydney, that was incredible.
text: Disturbing, but incredible.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Just so you know, and I’m serious
dialog: about this, I have no problems with
dialog: Mexicans whatsoever. I was just
dialog: trying to get you out of a DUI.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Got it.
text: They resume driving.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh, just when you called me back, I
dialog: didn’t know if you wanted to talk

dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Look, Pete, maybe this is weird to
dialog: admit, but, you seemed like a good
dialog: dude. I was just... seeing if you
dialog: wanted to get a beer.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No, there’s nothing weird about
dialog: that at all. Why can’t two guys go

dialog: Ave. We got her done before she
dialog: even went on the market.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What are you saying, Tevin?
speaker_heading: TEVIN

text: Butch grunts. Peter looks at Lester, through the window.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Can I ask... why do you think
dialog: Lester was on that website?
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: The same reason you were. He
dialog: wanted to find a friend.
text: Peter nods, clearly touched by this.
speaker_heading: JOANNE (CONT'D)
dialog: He’s a good kid, he’s just... a
dialog: little different.
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: Let’s call it what it is. He’s a
text: geek. Eleven years old, he dresses
dialog: like Merlin the Magician.
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: And we didn’t do him any favors
text: with his name. The other children
dialog: call him Lester the Molester.
dialog: 57.
text: Through the window, Peter eyes Lester practicing his
text: swordplay. He’s actually kind of skillful.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You know, I’m a, uh, fencer. I’m
dialog: in a club, it’s all legitimate.
dialog: Maybe I could take Lester over
dialog: there one day...
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: Not happening.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Alright, I just thought he could
dialog: maybe channel this sword and
dialog: sorcery stuff into a sport. It’s
dialog: in the Olympics. It’s very
dialog: competitive.
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: The school therapist did say he
dialog: needs more social interaction...
speaker_heading: BUTCH
dialog: You wear a goddamn mask when you
dialog: fence. Who the hell’s he going to
dialog: interact with?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Butch, it’s a surprisingly social
dialog: sport.
dialog: (hands them his card)
dialog: Why don’t you think about it, give
dialog: me a call if you change your mind.
text: ON LESTER -- he looks at Peter, waves. Peter waves back.
scene_heading: INT. PETER’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER
text: Peter holds Sydney’s business card. Clearly nervous. He
text: takes a deep breath, dials.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY (0.S.)
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Hey, Sydney? It’s, uh, it’s The
dialog: Pistol?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY (0.S.)
dialog: Who?
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Peter... Klaven. From the Father's
dialog: Office.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY (0.S.)
dialog: Hey, man. What’s going on?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Nothing, no, that was fun the other
dialog: night. I’m just seeing if you
dialog: wanted to get some lunch sometime.
dialog: Just, super casual. But, if you
dialog: don’t have time--
speaker_heading: SYDNEY (0.S.)
dialog: I’m about to take my Puggle for a
dialog: jaunt on the Venice Boardwalk. Why
dialog: don’t you join me for some eats?
scene_heading: EXT. VENICE BEACH BOARDWALK - DAY
text: Peter joins Sydney as he walks his PUGGLE.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
text: He’s a cross between a Beagle and a
dialog: Pug. Greatest dog in the world.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: He’s really cute. What’s his name?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Anwar Sadat. After Anwar Sadat.
dialog: The former President of Egypt.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Okay. ‘Cause you were a big fan of
dialog: his policies, or--
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: No, I was looking at an old issue
dialog: of TIME magazine with Sadat on the
dialog: cover when he was a puppy, it was
text: uncanny how much they looked alike.
text: Peter eyes Anwar Sadat, not quite seeing the resemblance.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: So, how’s Ferrigno coming? Any
dialog: offers?
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Not yet. This realtor I work with,
dialog: Tevin Downey wants to share the
dialog: listing with me.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: And split the commission? What
dialog: about that land you want to
dialog: develop?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yeah, I mean, it would put a delay
dialog: on that, but, I gotta sell this
dialog: house. Tevin’s a total cheeseball,
dialog: but, he markets himself like crazy,
text: racks up a lot of sales.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: The guy sounds like a douche. Who
dialog: needs him?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: He says the listing is out of my
dialog: league. Maybe he’s right.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Bullshit. That’s the insecurity
dialog: talking. The way you set-up that
dialog: Open House was understated, classy
dialog: and elegant. Those sandwiches you
dialog: put out were delicious.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Look, I’m definitely trying to sell
dialog: the place, I just--
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: No, Pete, trying is having the
dialog: intention to fail. You gotta
dialog: scratch that word from your vocab.
dialog: Say you'll do it. And you will.
text: As Peter considers this, Anwar the Puggle squats down and
text: poops. When he finishes, Sydney starts walking away.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You need a plastic bag or--
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Nah, I don’t pick up after my dog.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh. Isn’t it like a State Law--
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: It’s a ridiculous rule. Dog poop
dialog: is like compost. It has an
dialog: enormous amount of nutrients that
dialog: enrich the soil.
text: Just then, a MALE JOGGER, steps in Anwar’s shit.
speaker_heading: MALE JOGGER
dialog: Goddamnit! Clean up after your
dialog: dog!
text: And Sydney gets up right in his face.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
text: MIND YOUR OWN FUCK-HOLE! YOU ARE
text: LUCKY TO STEP IN MY BEAUTIFUL
text: PUGGLE’S SHIT!
text: Spooked, the jogger runs away.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Jesus, Sydney, what was that?!
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: (totally calm)
dialog: I’m aman, Peter. I have an ocean
dialog: of testosterone flowing through my
dialog: veins. Society implores us to act
dialog: civilized, keep everything under
dialog: control. But, the fact is, we’re
dialog: animals. And sometimes, we need
dialog: to let it out.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Try it.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Try what?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Scream. Come on, you're stressed
dialog: about the Ferrigno house. I
dialog: guarantee you’re anxious about your
dialog: wedding in ways you’re not even
dialog: aware of. Let it out, you’ll feel
dialog: better.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I can’t just scream in the middle
text: of the Venice boardwalk.
dialog: 61.
scene_heading: INT. UNDER THE BOARDWALK - MINUTES LATER
text: Peter and Sydney are alone. Peter quietly screams.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Abh...
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Okay, good. Now, gently remove
dialog: your vagina and try it again.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Aaahhh!!!
text: ABOVE THE BOARDWALK
text: We hear Peter scream louder. PEOPLE notice, concerned.
text: Peter does it again -- with even more gusto. And as he
text: finally lets out an incredible loud, guttural wail....
scene_heading: EXT. SYDNEY’S HOUSE - LATER THAT DAY
text: Establishing of a decent sized bungalow in Santa Monica.
text: Sydney leads Peter across his small yard, towards a GARAGE.
scene_heading: INT. SYDNEY’S GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
text: The two men enter. Peter’s eyes widen as he takes in the big
text: leather couch, which sits in front of three large screen TVs.
text: In a corner of the room there’s a music area with a drum
text: kit, guitar, bass, tambourines. A bong sits on a trunk which
text: serves as a coffee-table. On the walls, dozens of PHOTOS of
text: Sydney with his GUY FRIENDS -- singing karaoke, white-water
dialog: rafting, at restaurants, at the Grand Canyon, etc.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Mr. Klaven, welcome to the Temple
dialog: of Doom.
text: Peter takes it in, wide-eyed.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Holy shit, Sydney. This place is
dialog: insane.
text: Peter spots a laz-e-boy recliner next to a side-table with a
text: tube of Jergens and a box of CONDOMS.
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: What’s going on over there?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: (totally unembarrassed)
dialog: Oh, that’s where I jerk off.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Okay, I see. And the condoms--
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: I wear them while I masturbate. It
dialog: decreases sensitivity, so I can
dialog: last longer, and also there’s no
dialog: mess to clean up.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Are you kidding me?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Uh, no, I’m absolutely serious.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: And... when women come over--
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Pistol, this is a man-cave. No
dialog: woman has ever been granted access.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What about your guy friends?
dialog: You're not embarrassed to have that
dialog: out?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Masturbation is part of life.
dialog: You’ve never talked about jerking
dialog: off with any of your friends?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No, I haven’t.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: When’s the last time you did it?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I’m not telling you that.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: What are you afraid of? I’m not
dialog: going to tell anyone. Think of
text: this place as a cone of silence.
dialog: Just then,
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Zooey went to the Pasadena Flea
dialog: Market with her friends this
dialog: weekend. I did it while she was
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: What’d you use? Internet? DVD?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: That’s enough info for today.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: An old porno VHS tape?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I used a picture of Zooey ina
dialog: bikini from this vacation we took
dialog: to Cabo San Lucas.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: You jerked off to a picture of your
dialog: own girlfriend?! Are you sick?!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Why is that so wrong?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Pedro, it is wrong in so many ways,
dialog: I can’t even begin to describe it.
text: Peter’s cell-phone rings. He picks it up.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Hey, honey. No, I’m over at
dialog: Sydney’s house. Uh... nothing,
dialog: we're just chilling. I guess I
dialog: kind of played hooky this
dialog: afternoon. Yeah, no, I‘ll see you
dialog: at home later. Love you too, bye.
text: He hangs up.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Why’d you tell her you bailed from
dialog: work?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I didn’t want to lie to her.
dialog: You’re one of the most honest
dialog: people I’ve ever met, you can’t
dialog: understand that?
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: I’m honest with my friends. With
dialog: women, it’s a whole different
dialog: thing.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: That’s ridiculous.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: No, it’s not. There’s stuff you
dialog: share with dudes you could never
dialog: tell your girlfriend or wife.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I just don’t agree with that.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Okay, so, when you go home you’1l
dialog: tell Zooey that you jerked off to
dialog: her picture last weekend?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No, but..
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: But, you just revealed that to me.
text: Sydney shrugs. Outplayed, Peter’s got no response. He walks
text: over to the cluster of MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS in the corner.
text: There’s a poster for the band RUSH on the wall behind the
dialog: drumset.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Which one do you play?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: I’m a drummer. A stick-man. You
dialog: play an instrument?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I played guitar in high school.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Oh, were you in a band?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No. I just played by myself. For
dialog: fun.
dialog: (then, eyeing the poster)
dialog: Oh, man, I used to love RUSH.
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Dude! Best rock band in the world!
dialog: Neil Peart, hands down, greatest
dialog: stick-man who ever lived. We
dialog: should jam sometime.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: That’d be fun, man. Alright, I
dialog: should hit the road.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Coolio. I gotta get to bed early.
dialog: I’m taking a day-hike in Malibu
dialog: with some of my buddies tomorrow.
text: Peter is clearly taken aback by this revelation.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh, good. A buddies hike. That
dialog: sounds fun.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: (off Peter's vibe)
dialog: You’re welcome to join us.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh, no, thanks. I promised Zooey
dialog: we'd deal with some wedding crap
dialog: tomorrow.
dialog: (like it’s ridiculous)
dialog: Gotta get those “seating charts”
dialog: figured out.
dialog: (Sydney nods, doesn’t
dialog: care)
dialog: Alright, well, then, I‘1l, uh, I
dialog: will see you...I will see you, uh,
dialog: sometime soon. Good hang, Syd.
dialog: Really fun hang. I'’11 see you.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Adios, Pistol.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Later-gater.
scene_heading: INT. LUCKY STRIKE BOWLING ALLEY - NIGHT
text: Peter joins Robbie, who wears a league tee-shirt, inside
dialog: this hip “bowling lounge.”
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I’m acting like a freak. He told
dialog: me was going hiking with his
dialog: friends and I got jealous! What am
dialog: I supposed to do, tell him I want
dialog: to be exclusive?!
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: You have a little man-crush, that’s
dialog: all. Just make sure he’s not a
dialog: friend slut.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What’s that?
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
text: Someone who’s constantly picking up
text: new friends, dumping old ones.
dialog: Like Lance Armstrong.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Why is Lance Armstrong a friend
dialog: slut?
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Because, every week there’s
dialog: pictures of him in US Magazine
dialog: working out with another guy. It’s
text: Jake Gyllenhaal one day. Matthew
text: McConaughey the next.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (then, noticing something)
dialog: How long has dad been in your
dialog: bowling league?
scene_heading: PETER’S POV - OF THE LANES
text: We now see that Oz wears a matching shirt. He bowls a
text: strike, does a “crotch chop” a la professional bowler Pete
text: Weber, and hi-fives several of Robbie’s GAY TEAMMATES.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: He started rolling with us a few
dialog: months ago. The boys love him.
text: Oz gives one of the TEAMMATES an encouraging slap on the ass.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I mean, it definitely seems like he
dialog: likes me.
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: He sounds great. I just don’t want
dialog: you to get hurt, that’s all.
text: Peter eyes his brother appreciatively.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Thanks, Robbie.

text: listens in on Pete’s conversation.
text: BACK ON PETER - on the phone with Lou Ferrigno.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Mr. Ferrigno? Peter Klaven. It’s
dialog: nice to finally speak to you in
dialog: person.
text: As he listens to Ferrigno, Peter looks concerned.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m sorry, could you speak a little
dialog: slower. I’m just having trouble
dialog: understanding you. Yes, sir, of
dialog: course, I know you’re hearing
dialog: impaired--
text: BY THE FRONT DOOR - Sydney Fife enters the office. The
text: receptionist directs him towards Peter’s cubicle.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: ...if you’re saying that you’re
dialog: concerned about the house, don’t
dialog: worry. We’re holding another Open

speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: (quietly, motions to
dialog: phone)
dialog: Ferrigno.
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: I think I understand. We’ll get it
dialog: done. I promise. Goodbye.
text: Peter hangs up. Highly stressed. Tevin puts down his
text: receiver, scheming.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: The Hulk busting your balls?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I think so, it was kind of hard to
dialog: tell. I’m not trying to be... it’s
dialog: just, he’s hearing impaired, and he
dialog: was on a cell. What are you doing
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: My sperm bank is a few blocks away
dialog: on Westwood.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Are you kidding me?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: No, I deposit every couple of
dialog: weeks. I may as well get paid for
dialog: something I’m gonna do at home
dialog: anyway.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I want to argue with you about
dialog: these things, but, you do make a
dialog: certain kind of twisted sense.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: I got some leftover Koo-Koo Roo at
dialog: the house, you want to get some
dialog: lunch, squeeze in a little jam
dialog: session?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I can’t, Syd. I gotta deal with

text: Peter pops a Zantac.
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: What do you have, acid reflux?
speaker_heading: PETER
text: It comes and goes.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Dude, you’re not going to get
dialog: anything done in this state. You

scene_heading: INT. SYDNEY’S HOUSE - GARAGE - DAY

speaker_heading: HAILEY

speaker_heading: SYDNEY

speaker_heading: HAILEY

dialog: transferred to L.A., this has been
dialog: Peter’s favorite restaurant. So,
dialog: of course, he took Zooey here on
dialog: their first date.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No, I only take the girls I really
dialog: like to Yang Chow!
text: Zooey playfully hits Peter. Joyce continues.
speaker_heading: JOYCE
dialog: True, true! But, I remember, when
dialog: he got home that first night, he
dialog: called me up and said, ‘Mom, I’m
dialog: going to marry this girl. And it’s
dialog: not just because she wanted an
dialog: extra order of Slippery Shrimp!’
dialog: And, eight months later, here we
dialog: are! Peter, Zooey, we're so happy
dialog: for you. Cheers!
text: Everyone toasts. They’re about to eat when Sydney stands up,
text: clinks his fork against his glass.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: If I could just say a couple of
dialog: words.
dialog: 76.
text: The guests look confused. Oz quietly turns to Joyce...
speaker_heading: OZ
dialog: Who the hell is that?
speaker_heading: JOYCE
dialog: Be nice. He’s Peter’s new friend.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Zooey, I just want you to know,
dialog: that, you are marrying one of the
dialog: most honest, caring and fun loving
dialog: men I’ve ever had the pleasure of
dialog: knowing.
text: Oz looks to Robbie, mouths, ‘Fun?’ Robbie shrugs.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: “The Pistol” is a pleasure-giver.
dialog: The man lives to make other’s
dialog: satisfied. But guys like that
dialog: rarely ask for anything in return.
dialog: So, as his friend, I’m here asking
dialog: you, Zooey, give it back. Return
dialog: the favor. And if you do, I
dialog: guarantee, you’ll have a beautiful,
dialog: and pleasure filled union. To
dialog: Peter and Zooey.
text: The confused guests clink glasses. Zooey looks to
dialog: ‘What the hell did that mean?’
scene_heading: BY THE LADIES ROOM - MINUTES LATER
text: Zooey walks to the bathroom by a WALL OF POLAROIDS
text: eating at the restaurant. She takes them in, when
text: catches her eye. It’s of PETER, smiling, with his
text: an ATTRACTIVE WOMAN.
scene_heading: THE BANQUET ROOM - MINUTES LATER
text: Various family-style Chinese dishes line the table.
speaker_heading: OZ
dialog: Sydney, what line of work are you
dialog: in?
dialog: Peter --
dialog: of guests
dialog: one
dialog: arm around
text: He exits.
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: I do private investments, Oz.
dialog: Manage my own money. I holda
dialog: bunch of different market
dialog: positions. Small Cap, Large Cap, a
dialog: few foreign equities...
speaker_heading: OZ
dialog: What’d you do before you opened
dialog: your own shop? Train at one of the
dialog: big firms?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: No-no, I never joined that rat-
dialog: race. The idea of toiling like a
text: sheep in the trenches of some
text: faceless corp while the CEO and his
dialog: buddies get rich never appealed.
speaker_heading: JOYCE
dialog: Oz was at IBM for thirty eight
dialog: years.
speaker_heading: OZ
dialog: I guess I was one of these sheep
dialog: you're referring to.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Not at all, Oswald. I have a ton of
dialog: respect for the company man. It’s
dialog: just not the way I’m drawn.
dialog: (stands up)
dialog: ‘Scuse me, I just have to use the
dialog: little cowboy’s room.
text: People eat. Zooey turns to Peter.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: Did you know there’s a picture of
dialog: you and Lindsay up on the wall?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: There is? Oh, you know what, they
dialog: took that a few years ago. I’1l
dialog: ask Mr. Wong to take one of us.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: No, I don’t care. I was just,
text: pointing it out.
text: Oz shouts across the table to Peter...
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: OZ
dialog: Private investments? What the hell
dialog: does that mean?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Dad, why do you have to be a jerk?
dialog: He said he respects people who work
dialog: for companies. It’s just not his
dialog: thing.
speaker_heading: OZ
dialog: His thing?! Peter, you’ve known
dialog: this yutz for three weeks and
dialog: you’re acting like a bigger faggot
dialog: than your brother.
text: The guests look uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: It’s okay, everyone, I gave him
dialog: permission to use the “F” word.
dialog: Dad, you might be abusing the
dialog: privileges.
speaker_heading: OZ
dialog: Really? Alright, I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: JOYCE
dialog: Well, I like him very much. He’s
dialog: quite a unique individual. And he
text: clearly adores Peter.
text: Sydney reemerges with MR. WONG, the happy host.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: I asked this dude to take a picture
dialog: of you guys.
text: Mr. Wong aims a Polaroid camera at Peter and Zooey.
speaker_heading: MR. WONG
dialog: Smile, happy couple!
dialog: Off his FLASH, we, go to...
scene_heading: INT. PETER’'S CAR - NIGHT
text: Peter and Zooey drive home. Zooey is pissed.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: What the hell did you tell Sydney
dialog: about me?
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Uh, nothing. Aside from how much I
dialog: love you.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: Then, what was he talking about
dialog: with all that pleasure-giver stuff?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I might have mentioned that, you
dialog: know, you don’t love blowjobs.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: Ew! Peter, that stuff is private.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh, it is? Then, how come Hailey
dialog: and Denise know every detail about
dialog: our sex life?
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: It’s totally different. I’ve known
dialog: them forever. Sydney is
text: practically a stranger.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Well, now you know how I feel when
dialog: there’s no privacy with your
dialog: girlfriends.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: I thought you liked those guys?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I love them, but, sometimes I just
dialog: want things to be between you and
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: Fine.
text: They drive for a beat.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s not like I don’t like giving
dialog: blowjobs. The thing is, Rodney
dialog: hated getting them.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What guy doesn’t like getting
dialog: blowjobs?
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: He had this weird intimacy problem.
dialog: It’s part of why we split up. So,
dialog: I guess I just stopped doing it.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: See? If Sydney hadn’t asked me
dialog: about our sex life, we never would
dialog: have talked about this.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: I guess so. Still, it was a weird
dialog: toast, and he also told Hailey that
dialog: he hates the Dalai Lama.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: He did? I love the Dalai Lama.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: I know, he’s got such a cute smile.
dialog: He’s like a Tibetan Teddy Bear!
scene_heading: INT. REMAX REALTY OFFICE - DAY
text: As Peter heads to his desk, he passes Tevin Downey in his
text: cubicle, practicing sign language as he reads a copy of
text: SIGNING FOR DUMMIES. When he sees Peter, he tries to slide
dialog: the book under some papers.
speaker_heading: TEVIN
dialog: Uh-oh! There’s my dog!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: How come you’re learning sign
dialog: language?
speaker_heading: TEVIN
dialog: My aunt is coming to town this
dialog: weekend. She’s deaf, so, I want to
text: brush up on a few phrases.
text: Peter seems skeptical. He nods, walks away.
scene_heading: PETER’S CUBICLE - MINUTES LATER
text: Peter’s on the phone with Sydney.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Me too, Sydney. I’m really glad
dialog: you came. I gotta say, Zooey was a
dialog: little freaked out by your toast--
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY (0.S.)
dialog: Right, because I was pointing out
dialog: the truth about something
dialog: uncomfortable. One beej a month
dialog: does not a marriage make, my
dialog: friend.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yeah, no, in the end, I think it
dialog: led to a good talk, but--
speaker_heading: SYDNEY (0.S.)
dialog: Cool. Glad I could help. What are
dialog: you up to tonight?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I’m having a date with Zooey.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY (V.0.)
dialog: Okay, well, cancel that ASAP,
dialog: ‘cause I just got an e-mail alert
text: from the FLY BY NIGHT ARMY.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What is that?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY (0.S.)
dialog: Top secret RUSH fan-club. The holy
text: trinity are playing a small club
dialog: gig at THE MINT tonight. I have a
dialog: friend who can get us tix.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: That sounds fun, but, I kinda
dialog: promised her I would--
speaker_heading: SYDNEY (0.S.)
dialog: You have your entire life to have
dialog: dinner with Zooey. This is a
dialog: chance to get up close and personal
dialog: with the greatest rock band in
dialog: history.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I would like to check them out.
dialog: Can I invite Zooey along?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY (0.S.)
dialog: Really?
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yeah, it’d be a good chance for you
dialog: guys to hang out, start off ona
dialog: new foot.
scene_heading: EXT. THE MINT - NIGHT
text: RUSH fans pour into this mid-sized L.A. rock club.
scene_heading: INT. THE MINT - CONTINUOUS
text: Sure enough, RUSH plays in front of a small, packed crowd.
text: Peter, Sydney and Zooey are crushed between the masses, Peter
text: and Sydney singing along with LIMELIGHT, while Zooey looks
dialog: absolutely miserable.
speaker_heading: PETER SYDNEY
dialog: All the world’s indeed a All the world's indeed a
dialog: stage, And we are merely stage, And we are merely
dialog: Players, Peformers and Players, Peformers and
dialog: Portrayers, Each another's Portrayers, Each another's
text: audience, Outside the gilded audience, Outside the gilded
dialog: cage! cage!
text: Zooey looks at Peter like he is a complete stranger. He and
text: Sydney are lost in the moment, making eye-contact, singing to
text: each other... Zooey is completely left out.
scene_heading: INT. PETER AND ZOOEY’S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Zooey gets ready for bed. We can hear Peter on the phone on
text: his home office. Zooey quietly walks down the hall, sees
text: Peter through the half-open doorway.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Dude! I cannot believe they closed
dialog: with SUBDIVISION! That was
dialog: incredible... you’re right, Neil
dialog: Peart is a god. Thanks for hooking
dialog: that up, it was a great night.
dialog: I’1ll talk to you tomorrow.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Love you too, man. G’night.
text: Zooey is completely shocked that she just heard Peter tell
text: Sydney he loves him. Peter opens the door, catches Zooey
text: standing there.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: Were you spying on me?
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: You told Sydney you loved him?!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I said goodnight, I don’t remember
dialog: what I said.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: Peter, what is up with you two?
dialog: We're supposed to have a date, but,
dialog: instead, you drag me to this
dialog: concert. You don’t say one word to
dialog: me the whole night. You come home
text: and immediately get on the phone
dialog: with the guy. Are you in love with
dialog: him?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Of course not. Zooey, you said you
dialog: didn’t want me to be your best
dialog: friend, so, I went out and found
dialog: one. And you know what, it’s
dialog: great! I did it for you at first,
dialog: but, I had no idea what I was
dialog: missing. Do you know that I
dialog: haven’t taken a Zantac in three
dialog: weeks? It’s because there’s all
dialog: this stuff I was keeping inside
dialog: that I can finally talk about.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: That’s great, but, it doesn’t mean
dialog: you can’t share things with me. I
dialog: feel like I’m losing you a little
dialog: bit.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You’re not. I promise. I love
dialog: you. I just, like having a friend,
dialog: that’s all.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: Okay.
text: He kisses her. Things are heating up, when... Peter’s cell-
text: phone rings. He eyes the Caller I.D..
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I have to take this.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: Is that Sydney again?
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Actually, it’s Lester. He should
dialog: be in bed, I wonder why he’s
dialog: calling so late.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: Lester? The kid you met on the
dialog: internet? You’re still seeing him?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I thought I told you, I’m teaching
dialog: him to fence.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: No, you didn’t tell me.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (answers phone)
dialog: Lester? What’s going on? Right,
dialog: Kim Little, the girl from your
dialog: Social Studies class. What
dialog: happened?
text: Zooey starts to walk away, turns back.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: And I liked some of those RUSH
dialog: songs. Not that you ever looked at
dialog: me to notice.
text: She exits, leaving Peter on the phone.
scene_heading: INT. NEIMAN MARCUS DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY
text: Peter and Sydney stroll through the formalwear department.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: So, the big day is coming up. How
dialog: are you feeling?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I was feeling good, but, Zooey and
dialog: I have been fighting a lot in the
dialog: past couple of weeks.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Why are you marrying her?
text: Peter stops walking, faces Sydney.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What kind of question is that?
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: It seems like you’ve been in one
dialog: relationship after another. Is
dialog: Zooey the one, or is she just the
dialog: next one?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No, she’s the one.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: How come?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Because, I don’t know, we’re in
dialog: love and... that’s a hard question
dialog: to answer.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: I’m not trying to push you, I’m
dialog: genuinely curious. Come on, let’s
dialog: try on penguin suits.
scene_heading: FORMALWEAR DEPARTMENT - MEN’S DRESSING ROOM
text: Sydney talks to Peter behind the dressing room door.
speaker_heading: PETER (0.S.)
dialog: I’m thinking about asking Tevin if
text: he wants in on the Ferrigno house.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Dude, I saw that guy’s face on a
dialog: bus-stop ad. You do not need to
dialog: split the commission with that
text: frosted hair jag-off.
text: Peter walks out, wearing a nice, conservative tux.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I have to face facts, Syd, I’ma
dialog: flats guy. Tevin’s got the flash
dialog: needed to sell the place.
dialog: (re: the tux)
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Turn around, let me see the back.
text: Peter turns around. Syd stands up, starts touching the
text: fabric around Peter's shoulders
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s a bit conservative and I’m not
dialog: in love with the drape. I’d like
dialog: to see you in something with some
text: flare, peacock it out a little.
text: Sydney hands Peter a tux -- flashy, but cool-looking.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Here, give this one a shot.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: There is no freaking way I can pull
dialog: this off.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: You have this image of yourself as
dialog: this tight, by-the-book guy, but,
dialog: I’ve seen you let loose in the
dialog: Temple of Doom. It’s the same
dialog: thing with the Ferrigno house --
dialog: you have the skills, you just don’t
dialog: have the confidence. Try it on.
text: Peter reluctantly heads back into the dressing room with the
text: new tux. As he and Syd talk, we INTERCUT between dressing
text: room and waiting area.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, so, I wanted to talk to you
dialog: about something. I have an
dialog: investment opportunity, it’s a
dialog: complete winner, but, the problem
dialog: is all my funds are tied up in
dialog: equities, so, I’m cash poor right
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Yeah, I’ve got a bit of a liquidity
dialog: problem, so, I wanted to know if
dialog: you would consider loaning me a few
dialog: sheckles. I’d pay you back, of
dialog: course, with interest.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: How much money are we talking
dialog: about?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: I'd need like, five.
dialog: 87.
text: Peter exits the dressing room in his flashy tux.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Five thousand dollars?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Dude! That looks great!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: It does?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Don’t forget, Zooey’s artsy. She’s
dialog: gonna love that. You're like a
text: confident, sexy peacock.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Five thousand is a lot of money.
dialog: Zooey’s not really close with her
dialog: family, so, we’re paying for the
dialog: wedding--
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Pete, enough said. An opportunity
dialog: came up, thought I’d ask--
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Can you tell me about the
dialog: investment?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: I actually can’t. It’s
dialog: confidential in nature.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Okay. Well, let me think about it.
text: Just then, DOUG, the attractive guy who kissed Peter on their
text: man-date spots him.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Hello, Peter.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Doug, hi, how are you?
text: Awkward beat. Then...
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: You know, it takes a lot of nerve
dialog: to spend a beautiful evening with
dialog: someone, and never call them again.
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Doug, let me explain, I--
text: Doug eyes Sydney -- assuming they’re together.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: I get it, Peter. I just wish I
dialog: could take back that kiss, because,
dialog: I felt something I hadn’t felt in
dialog: years, and, now, I realize, it was
text: the taste of betrayal.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: It wasn’t the taste of betrayal!
text: And Doug storms off. Peter turns to Sydney.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: I can actually explain what just
dialog: happened there.
scene_heading: EXT. “THE GROVE” — DAY
text: Peter and Sydney stroll through this outdoor shopping mall.
text: Peter holds a Neiman Marcus bag with his new tuxedo.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: From the engagement party, I
dialog: figured you didn’t have a ton of
dialog: friends, but, I didn’t know it went
dialog: that far.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Either did I. The truth is, it was
dialog: never an issue until we got
dialog: engaged.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Wait, so, you were using me because
dialog: Zooey wanted you to have a Best
dialog: Man.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Dude, no, that’s not it at all. I
dialog: had actually given up on meeting
dialog: someone. Then, you came into that
dialog: Open House, we hit it off, and, one
dialog: thing led to the next.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: I just wish you had told me.
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I was embarrassed. Look, you have
dialog: a million friends--
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Who are pissed at me ‘cause I've
dialog: been spending so much time with
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: They’re like a bunch of teenage
dialog: girls. They'll be fine. Look, I
dialog: just want you to know, you can tell
dialog: me anything.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I really appreciate that, man.
dialog: (stops, turns to Syd)
dialog: So, listen, about that investment--—
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Pete, forget I even mentioned it.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No, I’ve been saving my whole life,
dialog: plus, you're right, I’m gonna sell
dialog: the Ferrigno house. I’m happy to
dialog: loan you the money. I know you’re
dialog: good for it.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Really?! Pistol, that’s great!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: It’s the least I can do for the
dialog: Best Man at my wedding.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I want you to stand up there with
dialog: me. Are you cool with that?
text: Sydney looks like he’s going to cry.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Of course I'll be your Best Man.
dialog: It would be my honor.
dialog: 90.
text: And Sydney reaches out and gives Peter a warm hug. Unused to
text: this intimacy, Peter pats him on the back, the way most men
dialog: do when they hug.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Sh-sh-sh, no patting, brother.
dialog: When you give a real hug you don’t
dialog: pat -- you just hold on and feel
dialog: the friendship.
text: Peter does. It’s different. More intimate. OZ AND ROBBIE
text: exit the movie theater at the Grove. They stop in their
text: tracks, as they spot Peter and Sydney holding each other.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Oh. My. God.
speaker_heading: OZ
dialog: I know you took away my permission,
dialog: but I’m sorry, those two are a
text: couple of tushy twins.
text: And then, Doug walks by, shaking his head as he watches Peter
dialog: and Sydney’s PDA...
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Uch. Fucking whore.
text: .».-only adding to Oz and Robbie’s confusion.
scene_heading: INT. FENCING GYMNASIUM - DAY
text: Peter and Lester have their masks off as they casually parry
dialog: with each other.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: It’s right here in L.A., it’s like
dialog: the biggest junior fencing
dialog: competition in the country. I say
dialog: we give it a shot.
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: You think I’m good enough?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Dude, you’re gonna kick those other
text: kids’ butts.
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: I don’t really want to do that,
dialog: Peter.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: gl.
speaker_heading: LESTER (CONT'D)
dialog: I just want to engage ina
dialog: gentlemanly contest and let the
dialog: best fencer win.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Of course. You can do that too.
scene_heading: INT. FENCING GYMNASIUM - LOCKER ROOM - MINUTES LATER
text: Peter and Lester change into their street clothes.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: So how’s it going with that girl?
dialog: What’s her name? Kim Little?
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: I asked her to coffee, she said
dialog: she’d never date any one named
dialog: Lester the Molester. I think she’s
dialog: sleeping with Sam Krickstein
dialog: anyway.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Lester, she’s eleven. I guarantee
dialog: you she’s not sleeping with Sam
dialog: Krickstein.
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Making love... whatever. They’re
text: definitely linked romantically.
text: Lester puts on his wizard’s hat and Harry Potter glasses.
text: Peter watches -- considering something.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Buddy, let me throw something out
dialog: here. I’m thinking the glasses and
dialog: hat might be getting in the way of
dialog: your social life.
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Well, they make a statement. And
dialog: it’s not a bad statement. It shows
dialog: you’re into magic and sorcery and
dialog: whatnot, but, I kind of feel like
dialog: you’re a cool dude on your own.
dialog: You don’t need the costume to prove
dialog: it.
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: You’re saying I should go without
dialog: the hat and glasses?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I’m saying try it. See how you
dialog: feel.
text: Lester considers this for a long beat. Then...
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: You may just have a point, Peter.
scene_heading: INT. PETER AND ZOOEY’S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The two of them sit around the kitchen table with pieces of
dialog: paper related to their wedding plans.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: So, if Hailey doesn't bring the
dialog: strap-on guy, which is pretty
dialog: likely, we’ll have an empty seat at
dialog: our table.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Actually, I was thinking Sydney
dialog: might sit with us.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I asked him to be my Best Man.
dialog: Beat. Zooey takes this in. Then...
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Well, are you happy about that?
dialog: Bummed? Give me something other
dialog: than, ‘Okay.’
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: I feel like he has some issue with
dialog: me -- maybe I’m crazy, but that’s
dialog: the vibe I get.
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I don’t think that’s the case. You
dialog: guys just haven’t spent that much
dialog: time together. But, I’1l talk to
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: Peter, no, don’t do that.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: Because, then he’s going to think
dialog: I’m saying shit about him.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: But you are saying shit about him.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: That’s not the point. I don’t want
dialog: you to say anything. Please.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: (back to the wedding
dialog: stuff)
dialog: Alright, so, we still need to pick
dialog: up the marriage license. Can you
dialog: do it at lunch tomorrow?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Um, yeah, I mean, I can move some
dialog: stuff around.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: Well, do you have a meeting or
dialog: something?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No, I was just gonna meet up with
dialog: Sydney. It’s fine, I'll move it.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: We can make it after lunch if
dialog: that’s better.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Okay, yeah. What about two O’clock

speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: Fine.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Hey, I’m excited. It’s becoming
dialog: so official!
text: Zooey smiles weakly.
scene_heading: EXT. VENICE BEACH BOARDWALK - DAY

text: LANCE ARMSTRONG and VIN DIESEL roller-blade past them.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: Fucking Lance Armstrong.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: So, what did Zooey say about me
dialog: being your Best Man?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: She, was uh, she was cool about it.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Dude, come on, your voice went up
dialog: when you said that.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Fuck. I’m the worst liar. I
dialog: promised her I wouldn't say
dialog: anything, but, she feels like you
dialog: haven’t made an effort with her.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Pete, Zooey seems like a great
dialog: girl, but, the fact is, she’s not
dialog: my friend. You are, and, to that
dialog: end, I’m there for you, 100
dialog: percent. It’s bro's before ho’s’
dialog: with me. Some women have a problem
dialog: with that, but, that’s just the way
dialog: it is.
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Is that why your marriage broke up?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Sure, it was a contributing factor.
text: Across the way, something catches Peter’s eye.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I knew that’s why he was learning
dialog: sign language.
text: Peter’s POV -- at a boardwalk restaurant, Tevin Downey is
text: having lunch with the incredibly muscular LOU FERRIGNO.
dialog: Too late.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Holy shit. Is that Downey? We
dialog: gotta confront them.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Syd, no, let me think for second.
text: Sydney is on the move, storming up to their table.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: What the hell do you think you’re
dialog: doing?!
speaker_heading: TEVIN
dialog: Do I know you?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: No, but I believe you know my
dialog: friend, Peter Klaven, who has the
dialog: exclusive on this man’s property!
text: Peter walks up to them.
speaker_heading: TEVIN
dialog: Hey, Peter. You know Lou Ferrigno,
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yes, hi, Mr. Ferrigno. How do you
dialog: two know each other?
speaker_heading: TEVIN
dialog: I reached out to Lou, ‘cause, I’m
dialog: organizing a fund-raiser for
dialog: hearing impaired athletes. It’s a
dialog: cause that’s near and dear to me.
dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: That is total crap, you cheeseball!
dialog: Lou, you gave Peter the listing on
dialog: the house...
speaker_heading: LOU FERRIGNO
dialog: I know, and he’s not doing shit
dialog: with it!
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: That’s bullshit, Hulk! He’s
text: setting the table, lining up some
dialog: serious buyers. This stuff doesn’t
dialog: happen overnight.
speaker_heading: TEVIN
dialog: Peter, who the hell is this guy?!
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Am I talking to you, Hi-Lites? I
dialog: don’t think so. Look, Hulk--
speaker_heading: LOU FERRIGNO
dialog: Please get your hand out of my face
dialog: and stop calling me Hulk. I’ma
dialog: person, okay?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: (getting really worked up)
dialog: You’re a person?! So is Peter
dialog: Klaven! He’s busted his dick
dialog: trying to sell your house, and you
dialog: double-cross him with this Redondo
dialog: Beach douchebag!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Sydney!
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Fuck you, Hulk!
text: Sydney throws a punch at Lou Ferrigno who dodges it, with
text: very little effort, grabs Sydney, putting him into a sleeper-
text: hold, as he gently eases him onto the ground. As Sydney
text: futilely fights back--
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: Easy, easy, don’t fight it.
text: Peter’s cell-phone rings.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Hello?!
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY (0.S.)
dialog: Hey, I’m just checking in. I’m on
dialog: my way to the Marriage Bureau.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Ahhh!!! Get the fuck off of me!!!
speaker_heading: ZOOEY (0.S.)
dialog: Is that Sydney?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yes, he got in a fight with Lou
dialog: Ferrigno--
speaker_heading: ZOOEY (0.S.)
dialog: He what?! What is going on?!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Zooey, I don’t think I can make it.
dialog: I’m really sorry.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY (0.S.)
dialog: How could you not make it?! Peter---
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Zo, I gotta go!
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: He’s choking me! The Hulk is
dialog: choking me!
scene_heading: INT. PETER AND ZOOEY’S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: They stand in the kitchen. Zooey is dumbfounded.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: Why would anyone get in a fight
dialog: with Lou Ferrigno?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Sydney’s a hot-head. He thought he
dialog: was standing up for me.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: So did you lose the listing?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I believe I did.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: And what does that mean for your
dialog: development property?
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I probably have to let it go. I
dialog: was counting on the commission for
dialog: the down payment.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: You have some money saved up.
dialog: Can’t you write them a check, you
dialog: know, to show your good faith.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No. Between the wedding, and, then
dialog: I lent Sydney some money, I’m just
dialog: a little short.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: Wait-wait, you lent Sydney money?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: For an investment. All his money
dialog: was tied up in equities, so... I
dialog: mean, he’s going to pay me back.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: Peter, that’s not the point. We’re
dialog: getting married. You can’t keep
dialog: that kind of stuff from me.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Can I ask you something? Why do
dialog: you think we’re getting married?
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Sydney asked me the question, you
dialog: know, ‘Why Zooey?’ And I... of
dialog: course I love you, but, I’m not
dialog: exactly sure how to answer that.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: Are you kidding me? Two weeks,
dialog: before our wedding you’re asking me
dialog: why we're getting married?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I... it just came up. Okay?
dialog: Forget I even asked.
dialog: 99.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: You know, Peter, in my opinion,
dialog: that’s the kind of thing you figure
dialog: out with your friends, not your
dialog: fiance.
dialog: (anger building)
dialog: So, I am going to stay with Denise
dialog: and Barry, and you and your pal
dialog: Sydney can hang out, and go to RUSH
dialog: concerts, and fight Lew Ferrigno,
dialog: while you try to answer the
dialog: question of why the hell you
dialog: proposed to me after only eight
dialog: months of dating. Okay?! Goodbye!
text: She exits, SLAMMING the door behind her.
scene_heading: PETER’S HOME OFFICE - LATER THAT NIGHT

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: This is good? How is this good,
dialog: Sydney?
scene_heading: SYDNEY’S GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
scene_heading: (INTERCUT CONVERSATION)
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Because, Pistol, you need to be
dialog: sure. This will give you some
dialog: space to think about what you’re
dialog: doing. I’m going to Joshua Tree
dialog: with some of my buddies for the
dialog: weekend. Why don’t you come with?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Did you hear what I said?! Zooey
dialog: walked out on me! How can I think
dialog: about taking a male-bonding weekend
dialog: trip?! And also, why do all you
dialog: guys always go to Joshua Tree?!
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Peter, in times of stress, your guy
dialog: friends are who you can count on.
dialog: This is exactly the time for you to
dialog: be doing that. Alright, Seinfeld’s
dialog: on Letterman. I gotta go.
text: G’night.
dialog: 100.
text: Peter hangs up, looks out the window. His neighbor is now
text: sharing an INTIMATE ROMANTIC DINNER with a date. They laugh,
text: then, he kisses her. Peter looks troubled. His phone rings.
text: He picks it up.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Hey, Lester. Yes, tomorrow
dialog: afternoon. I’11 pick you up.
dialog: What? No, I’m fine. Nothing.
dialog: Just some stuff with Zooey. I’11
dialog: see you tomorrow.
scene_heading: EXT. PETER AND ZOOEY’S HOUSE - MORNING
text: Peter looks like crap as he walks towards his car.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. PETER’S CAR - MORNING
text: He drives to work when something catches his eye.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh my god.
text: PETER’S P.O.V. -- there is a huge BILLBOARD of Peter, a la
text: James Bond in a tuxedo, pointing a gun at the lens. A sign
text: beneath reads: “PETER KLAVEN. LICENSE TO SELL.” At the
text: bottom, his office number at Remax Realty.
text: Peter turns a corner -- sees ANOTHER BILLBOARD with his
text: likeness. This time, he’s in a suit, with Ray-Ban sunglasses
text: tipped onto his nose, like a poster for a cheesy 80s movie.
text: The slogan reads: “PETER KLAVEN. THE MARKET’S SO BRIGHT,
text: HE'S GOTTA WEAR SHADES.”
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh. My goddd!
text: Peter turns into his office parking lot. Right across the
text: street, another billboard. In this one, he’s dressed as a
text: COWBOY, (with a thick moustache) -- photo-shopped in front of
text: an Olde West Street. The slogan reads: “PISTOL” PETE KLAVEN.
text: THE FASTEST REALTOR IN THE WEST.”
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh. My. Gooooddd!!!
scene_heading: INT. REMAX REALTY OFFICE - DAY
text: As Peter enters, his co-workers, who have clearly been
text: talking about his billboards, pretend to go back to work.
dialog: 101.
text: He heads to his desk, mortified. The older female co-worker
text: walks by. She’s being genuine...
scene_heading: OLDER FEMALE CO-WORKER
dialog: Very creative advertising.
text: He nods, then makes eye-contact with Tevin Downey, who
text: mockingly pretends to shoot a gun in his direction.
scene_heading: EXT. SYDNEY’S HOUSE - DAY
text: Peter’s car screeches to a halt in front of the house.
scene_heading: THE GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Peter bangs on the door to the man-cave. Sydney opens
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: That’s what you spent my five
dialog: thousand dollars on?!
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: You saw the billboards?! Pretty
dialog: awesome, right?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Pretty awesome?! “The Fastest
dialog: Realtor In The West?!” “The
dialog: Market’s So Bright, He’s Gotta Wear
dialog: Shades?!” They’re idiotic! I’1l
dialog: be the laughing stock of the entire
dialog: real estate industry!
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: You know what, man, I was trying to
dialog: help, okay? That douchebag Downey
dialog: has bench ads over the entire West
dialog: Side. You need this kind of stuff
dialog: to get a leg up on the competition.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Look, I appreciate the gesture,
dialog: but, why didn’t you just tell me?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Because, I know you, Pistol. I
dialog: knew you’d react exactly the way
dialog: you’re doing now. So, I figured
dialog: I’d take matters into my own hands.
dialog: it.
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Sydney, in one day you’ve screwed
dialog: up my career, ruined my
dialog: relationship--
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: By doing what?! Asking why you
dialog: wanted to marry Zooey? That’s what
dialog: men do for each other.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I am so goddamn sick of your
dialog: ridiculous codes! ‘You can’t tell
dialog: women this.’ ‘It’s bro’s before
dialog: ho’s.’ Sydney, I like sharing
dialog: stuff with Zooey. I like spending
text: time just hanging out with her.
dialog: You know that my favorite night in
dialog: the last five years is when she and
dialog: I stayed home, made a summer salad,
dialog: and watched CHOCOLAT together. And
dialog: it was my pick at Blockbuster!
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: CHOCOLAT? That is just... I don’t
dialog: even know where to begin.
dialog: Beat. Then...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Look, I think we need some time
dialog: apart.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Us. This. Whatever it is we’re
dialog: doing here. It’s not working out.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: You know what, man, I have to
dialog: agree.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Right, so, I think it’s probably
dialog: best, that, uh... if I do actually
dialog: have a wedding...
dialog: (this is hard for him)
dialog: ...that you not be there.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Sounds good to me.
dialog: 103.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: And, if you could have those
dialog: billboards taken down--
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Will do. And I'll get you that
dialog: five grand next week.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No rush. Oh, and I think you have
dialog: my season two LOST dvd’s. I mean,
dialog: if you haven’t watched them, you
dialog: could just--
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: It’s okay, man. Here you go.
text: Sydney picks up the box-set of LOST, hands it to Peter. The
text: two men shake hands.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: I wish you the best of luck, Peter.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You too, Sydney.
dialog: (as he leaves)
dialog: Why would you hate the Dalai Lama?
dialog: He’s absolutely adorable and he
dialog: stands for peace.
text: And Peter exits.
scene_heading: EXT. SYDNEY’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: Peter heads to his car, passing Sydney’s FRIENDS, who have
text: just pulled up in a VAN, ready for their weekend away.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: He’s all yours, guys.
text: They look confused as Peter gets in his car, speeds away.
scene_heading: INT. L.A. SPORTS ARENA - DAY
text: A major Junior fencing competition is taking place. Peter
text: stands near the “STRIP” (the fencing area) with Lester, who’s
text: about to go on. Peter seems really wound up.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: How you doing, Lester? You
dialog: nervous?
dialog: 104.
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Not really. I feel a strong sense
dialog: of inner peace.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Alright, good. ‘Cause I feel like
dialog: I’m gonna throw up.
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Hey, Peter.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: I’m really glad you’re my friend.
text: Peter’s clearly touched. An ANNOUNCER approaches.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER
dialog: You ready, son?
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: The announcer speaks into a mic.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER
dialog: And now, for the final match of the
dialog: Los Angeles County Junior Fencing
dialog: Competition, from Riverside, we
dialog: have Aaron Lieberman. And from
dialog: Glendale, we have Lester, the uh...
text: (confused, as he reads
dialog: from a piece of paper)
text: ...Lester “The Molester” Marsh.
text: Owning the nickname, Lester raises his hand, as he
text: acknowledges the small crowd.
text: The two fencers salute each other, as we go into SLOW MOTION.
text: Lester is incredible. Graceful. Confident. Totally in
text: control. Peter cheers on his protege.
text: The crowd grows as word of an incredible fencer spreads
text: throughout the arena.
text: The referee continues awarding Lester points.
text: And, after closing with a flourish, the match ends. The
text: referee raises Lester’s hand in triumph.
dialog: 105.
text: Lester removes his helmet, as a huge smile crosses his face.
text: The crowd cheers. He gentlemanly bows to his opponent and
text: shakes his hand.
scene_heading: END SLOW MOTION
text: Peter runs up to Lester.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Dude! That was incredible!
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: It was an excellent match. My
dialog: opponent was very skilled, but, I
dialog: think I got the better of him.
text: Then, a CUTE GIRL, 12, dressed in fencing gear, approaches.
speaker_heading: CUTE GIRL
dialog: Mr. Marsh? I’m Kira. I fence in
dialog: the Van Nuys club. Would you like
dialog: to parry with me sometime?
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: I would very much like that, me-
dialog: lady.
speaker_heading: CUTE GIRL
dialog: Okay, cool. Here’s my e-mail.
text: She hands him a piece of paper with her info, walks away.
text: Lester turns to Peter, stunned.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You got digits!
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: I know! How awesome is that!
text: They try to hi-five, but end up missing each other’s hands.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: We'll get that next time. Come on,
dialog: I’m taking you out to celebrate.
scene_heading: INT. YANG CHOW RESTAURANT - NIGHT
text: Peter and Lester eat Chinese food.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: -».so, if you and that fencing girl
dialog: hit it off, you need to figure out
text: a place to take her for a date.
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Like my room?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No, somewhere public, like a
dialog: restaurant, or Pinkberry. One of
dialog: the reasons I like to come here
dialog: with women is they know me. I’m
dialog: familiar with the menu. I’m
dialog: comfortable here. Dating is
dialog: stressful enough, you want to try
dialog: to control your environment as much
dialog: as possible.
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: You really know a lot about girls.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Girls I’m pretty good at. Guys,
dialog: not so much. I gotta run to the
dialog: bathroom, I’1l be right back.
scene_heading: BY THE MEN’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Peter waits for the Men’s Room to open up. As he does, he
text: eyes the WALL OF PHOTOS. The Polaroid of him and Lindsay is
text: still up. But next to it is a new photo, taken the night of
text: the engagement party, of Peter and Zooey -- looking happy and
dialog: in love.
text: MR. WONG, the owner of the restaurant, approaches. He points
text: to the new photo..
speaker_heading: MR. WONG
dialog: Came out nice, right? Where’s your
dialog: beautiful fiance?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh, hey, Mr. Wong. Yeah, she, uh,
dialog: she couldn’t make it tonight.
speaker_heading: MR. WONG
dialog: You are lying.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: How the hell did you know that?
speaker_heading: MR. WONG
dialog: You’re voice got high, like a girl.
dialog: I’m not worried about you, Peter.
dialog: You’1l bring a new one in here soon
dialog: enough.
dialog: 107.
text: He pats Peter on the shoulder, exits. Peter takes this in,
text: then, he turns, looks again at the photos of him with Lindsay
text: and Zooey. He turns his attention across the restaurant to
text: Lester, happily eating a moo-shoo pancake, as we go...
scene_heading: CLOSE ON A HAND RINGING A DOOR-BELL
scene_heading: EXT. BARRY AND DENISE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

text: FRIENDS, who do not look happy to see him.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: I can’t stay. Just came to talk to
dialog: my fiance.
text: Zooey approaches.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: “License to Sell?”
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I know. That’s what Sydney did
dialog: with the five grand I lent him. He
dialog: thought they’d be good for my
dialog: career.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: They definitely get your name out
dialog: there. And you look kind of cute
text: with a thick moustache.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Zooey, I know why I want to marry
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: I’m all ears.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: The truth is, I have been a
dialog: girlfriend guy, but, you’re the
dialog: first woman I’ve ever been with who
dialog: really wants me to have my own
dialog: life.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 108.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: I have to come clean, I heard you
dialog: talking about me at that ladies
dialog: night a couple months ago.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: Of course you did. It was totally
text: obvious.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh. Okay, well, I thought you
dialog: wanted me to have friends for you,
dialog: but, I’m pretty positive you
dialog: actually wanted that for me. And,
dialog: that’s one of the most romantic
dialog: things I can ever imagine. So, can
dialog: we get this engagement back on
dialog: track.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: Yes. I hate it here. Barry and
dialog: his friends are awful.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: By the way, I ended things with
dialog: Sydney.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: Really? Peter, I hope you didn’t
dialog: do that for me.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I didn’t. He can be a great guy,
dialog: but, it just wasn’t working out.
text: And we FADE UP a slow, acoustic version of the classic Queen
dialog: song, “You’re My Best Friend,” over the following:
scene_heading: EXT. PETER’S CAR - DAY
text: He drives past his development site near downtown L.A.,
text: clearly upset that it is now out of his reach.
scene_heading: EXT. VENICE BEACH BOARDWALK - DAY
text: Sydney walks Anwar Sadat alone. The dog poops. He walks
text: away. A WOMAN screams at him but Sydney just keeps walking --
text: doesn’t have the energy to scream back at her.
dialog: 109.
scene_heading: INT. SILVERLAKE RESERVOIR - DUSK
text: Peter and Zooey walk hand in hand on jogging path, engrossed
text: in conversation -- connecting again. A WOMAN jogs by -- she
text: looks exactly like her DOG.
text: Peter points her out to Zooey...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Check it out... she’s a Bowser.
text: She looks exactly like her dog.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: I don’t really see it.
text: Peter is clearly disappointed...
scene_heading: INT. SYDNEY’S HOUSE - GARAGE - NIGHT
text: Sydney puts his Jergens and condoms from his jerk-off area
text: into a drawer. He looks longingly at the music area,
text: focusing in on the guitar Peter used to play.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. PETER’S CAR - DAY
text: As Peter drives to work, he looks up, catches one of his
text: billboards. Shakes his head. But on his face, it’s clear
text: he’s starting to see the humor in it.
scene_heading: EXT. SYDNEY’S VESPA - DAY
text: While he drives, he looks up at another “PETER KLAVEN”
text: billboard. Clearly thinking about his friend.
text: And we END THE SONG as the montage comes to a close...
scene_heading: INT. REMAX REALTY OFFICE - DAY
text: Peter enters the office. The RECEPTIONIST greets him.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Peter, where have you been?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh, my wedding’s this weekend, we

dialog: 110.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Alright, well, check your voice-

dialog: messages.
text: Off Peter’s confusion...
scene_heading: PETER CUBICLE - MOMENTS LATER
text: He picks up the phone, dials his voice-mail. In a SERIES OF

dialog: Then..
scene_heading: BUYERS AND SELLERS
dialog: ‘Is this Pistol Pete? I have a
dialog: home in Los Feliz I’ve been trying

dialog: ‘I’m looking for a property in Bel

dialog: that’s hysterical. Call me.’
speaker_heading: LOU FERRIGNO (0.S.)
dialog: Peter, hi, it’s Lou Ferrigno.
dialog: Great freakin’ billboards! I’m
dialog: sorry I doubted you, man. I told
dialog: that douchebag Tevin, I want you to
dialog: have the exclusive back, so, if you
dialog: can forgive and forget, please give
dialog: me a call. Oh, and I have a signed
dialog: HULK poster for your friend. I
dialog: hope his neck is okay. Thanks,
dialog: Peter. Or, should I say, “Pistol
dialog: Pete.” Call me.
text: Peter looks out the window, where one of Sydney’s billboards
text: is mounted. He clearly can’t believe it. Tevin Downey
text: approaches from the back, starts tickling Peter.
speaker_heading: TEVIN
dialog: There’s my Dog!
dialog: (Peter pushes him away)
dialog: Me likey the billboards. I
dialog: underestimated you, my brother.
dialog: What say we go to Houston's, grab a
text: burger and a beer and figure out
dialog: how we can tag-team this Ferrigno
dialog: thing.
dialog: 111.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You know what, Tevin. I would
dialog: never go for a beer with you.
dialog: Because I only do that with my
dialog: friends. And you, sir, have no
dialog: idea what it means to be a friend.
dialog: Now if you’1l excuse me, I have to
dialog: go to my wedding. And also, the
dialog: next time you tickle me, I’m gonna

speaker_heading: OZ

speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: OZ

speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: OZ

speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: I was wrong about the Dalai Lama.
dialog: He’s an amazing guy.
speaker_heading: HAILEY

text: laugh, hitting it off.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: So what happened? I thought you
dialog: couldn’t stand him.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: The more I thought about it, the
dialog: more I realized he did what a great
dialog: friend is supposed to do. He asked
dialog: you the really tough questions, and
dialog: I’m pretty sure he did it because
dialog: he cares about you.
dialog: (off Peter's nod)
dialog: Plus, you seemed really sad when I
dialog: didn’t get that whole Bowser thing.
text: Sydney approaches.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Thanks for calling, Zooey.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY

dialog: in time.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Well, there was no traffic and I’m
dialog: a pretty fast driver, so--
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Dude, you’re lying. Your voice
dialog: when up when you said that.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: I was five minutes away when Zooey
dialog: called. I love you, man. Invite
dialog: or not, there was no way I was
dialog: gonna miss your wedding. And also,
dialog: I wanted to give you this.
text: Sydney hands Peter a check for FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Sydney, you don’t need to do this.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Pistol, I know you don’t believe
dialog: this, but, I’m actually a pretty
dialog: successful investor. I told you, I
dialog: just had a liquidity problem. The
dialog: billboards were a gift.
dialog: 118.
dialog: 119.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh my god, they worked! We have an

speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: Oh, and, for the record, Sydney, I
dialog: do like giving blowjobs. I just
dialog: got out of the habit. But, thanks
dialog: for looking out for your buddy
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: I’ve learned more about how to
dialog: treat women from this guy than any
dialog: friend I’ve ever had. The least I
dialog: can do is make sure he’s getting
dialog: bj’s on a regular basis.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I am just incredibly uncomfortable
dialog: with the conversation you two are
dialog: having.
speaker_heading: ZOOEY

dialog: musicians to stop playing.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Hi, everyone. Thank you all so
dialog: much for being here. Since getting
dialog: engaged to Zooey Rice, I’ve learned
dialog: a lot about myself, about
dialog: relationships, and about
dialog: friendships. Zooey, I know you
dialog: don’t like me to say this, but, I
dialog: don’t care. You’re my best friend,
dialog: and I hope that never changes.
dialog: 120.
text: ON ZOOEY - tearing up. She quietly replies...
speaker_heading: ZOOEY
dialog: You’re my best friend too, Peter.
text: Denise and Hailey exchange a look. They have to accept it.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: There are just a few people here I
dialog: want to mention specifically.
dialog: First off, my younger brother
dialog: Robbie. We haven’t been close our
dialog: whole lives, but, these past few
dialog: months, he’s helped me in ways I
dialog: could never imagine. So, Robbie,
dialog: here’s to you.
dialog: (looks around)
dialog: Where is he?
speaker_heading: OZ
text: I think he’s banging the caterer.
text: Doug drops his head, bummed.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh, I see. Well, I'll just convey
dialog: that to him in private. Anyway,
dialog: Mom, Dad, Lester, Hailey, Denise,
dialog: you guys have all been there for me
dialog: as well, and I thank you for that.
dialog: But most of all, I want to thank
dialog: someone who taught me the true
dialog: meaning of friendship. Sydney
dialog: Fife, I love you, man.
text: Peter walks up to Sydney, and the two men hug. No patting.
text: And as they hold on to each other, Joyce turns to Oz...
speaker_heading: OZ
dialog: I’m not saying a word.
text: And as CREDITS ROLL...

dialog: 121.
text: The rest of the band joins in, and the guests start to dance.
text: As the music continues, Sydney RIPS his shirt off...
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: I’m doing it, man! I’m going full
dialog: McConaughey!
text: Peter cracks up, looks to Zooey -- her face a combination of
text: shock and delight. And as he unbuttons the top couple of
