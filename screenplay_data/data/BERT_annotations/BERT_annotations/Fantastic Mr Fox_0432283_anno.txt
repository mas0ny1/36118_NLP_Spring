scene_heading: EXT. WOODS. DAY
text: An apple tree stands alone at the top of a hill. A handsome
text: fox dressed in an Edwardian-style navy velvet suit leans
text: against it with his arms folded and his legs crossed, chewing
text: on a reed of wild grass. He holds an apple core in his paw.
text: He spits out a seed. He looks off across a meadow that
text: descends into the valley below.
text: A female fox strides briskly up the hill. Her coat is a
text: paler, especially beautiful shade of fox-red, and she wears
text: men's trousers and a dark tunic. Fox says as she approaches:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: What'd the doctor say?
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
dialog: Nothing. Supposedly, it's just a twenty-
dialog: four hour bug. He gave me some pills.
speaker_heading: FOX
speaker_heading: (REASSURINGLY)
dialog: I told you. You probably just ate some
text: bad gristle.
text: Fox brushes the fur on Mrs. Fox's ears with his paws. They
text: walk together along the crest of the hill to a fork in the
dialog: path. Fox points:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Should we take the short cut or the
dialog: scenic route?
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
dialog: Let's take the short cut.
speaker_heading: FOX
text: But the scenic route is so much prettier.
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
speaker_heading: (SHRUGS)
dialog: OK, let's take the scenic route.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Great. It's actually slightly quicker,
dialog: anyway.
text: Fox throws his apple core away over his shoulder and dances a
text: quick circle around Mrs. Fox, wrapping his arm around her
text: waist extravagantly and making her laugh as they start off
text: down the scenic route.

dialog: 2.
scene_heading: EXT. FARM. DAY
text: A rustic cottage surrounded by a small barn, a tin silo, and
text: a rickity windmill. There is a sheep in a little pasture. A
text: sign on a rail says Berkus Squab. Fox and Mrs. Fox watch from
text: the bushes outside a fence.
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
dialog: What is a squab?
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: You know what a squab is. It's like a
dialog: pigeon, I suppose. Anyway, it's a type of
dialog: bird we can eat.
text: Fox motions toward the edge of the property.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Should we go through the hole under the
dialog: horse fence or climb the rail over the
dialog: bridle path?
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
dialog: Well, I guess the horse fence would be a
dialog: little safer.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: But the bridle path puts us out right
text: next to the squab shack.
text: Mrs. Fox hesitates. She fiddles with her paws. She nods
text: nervously. She shakes slightly. Fox looks at her funny.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: What's wrong? I've never seen you like
dialog: this. You're acting all skittish. Don't
dialog: worry. I've been stealing birds for a
dialog: living since before I could trot.
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
speaker_heading: (SHRUGS)
dialog: OK, let's take the --
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: No, we'll do the horse fence. You gave me
text: the scenic route already.
text: Fox flashes a smile. He says suddenly:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: By the way, you look unbelievably
dialog: beautiful tonight. You're practically
text: glowing. Maybe it's the lighting.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 3.
text: Mrs. Fox is, in fact, glowing, albeit ever so slightly. She
text: stares at Fox enigmatically. Fox touches his paw to her
dialog: cheek.
text: (NOTE: an alternate version of Mrs. Fox will be used for this
text: shot which can be literally lit from within.)
text: With the speed, grace, and precision of athletes, Fox and
text: Mrs. Fox: dart through a hole under a painted fence; race
text: along a thin trail next to a garage; crawl beneath a window
text: where a blonde woman serves an early dinner, dealing
text: hamburgers like playing cards to three little, blond
text: children; creep past a doghouse where a golden retriever
text: sleeps with an airline sleeping mask over his eyes; and
text: shimmy over a doorway outside a workshop where a blond,
text: bearded farmer hacks into a stump with a hatchet, completely
text: pulverizing it into sawdust. They arrive in front of a wooden
text: shed. Fox whistles sharply with a half-chirp and performs a
text: rapid reverse-flip with a flourish.
text: Fox lifts a loose board. He looks to Mrs. Fox and puts his
text: finger to his lips for her to be quiet. She shrugs
text: impatiently. They duck inside.
text: They come back out. Each holds a dead, bloody pigeon in
text: his/her teeth. They start to run away. Fox looks up above
text: them. He stops. He frowns. He takes the pigeon out of his
text: mouth and says curiously, pointing toward the sky:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: What's that? I think that's a fox-trap!
dialog: Look at this.
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
dialog: Get away from there.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Is it spring-loaded? Yeah...
dialog: (pointing to different spots)
dialog: I guess if you come from over there, and
text: you're standing at the door to the squab
dialog: shack, this little gadget probably
dialog: triggers the --
dialog: (gesturing to Mrs. Fox)
dialog: Move out of the way, darling. That's
dialog: right where it's going to land.
text: Mrs. Fox runs back to Fox and tugs at his arm.
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
dialog: Come on! Stop it! Let's go!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 4.
text: Fox pulls on a little, hanging wire. A chain unrolls rapidly
text: from a pulley, and a steel cage falls slap down on top of
text: them. A small tag on the base of it says Badoit et Fils. Fox
text: and Mrs. Fox stand motionless, side by side, in disbelief.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: No, it just falls straight down right
dialog: here, doesn't it? I guess it's not spring-
dialog: loaded.
text: Sounds come from around the farm: the dog barks, doors open,
text: voices yell, lights come on. Mrs. Fox turns to Fox and says
speaker_heading: QUIETLY:
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
dialog: I'm pregnant.
text: Fox stares at Mrs. Fox. He is confused but moved.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Wow. We're going to have a cub. Honey,
dialog: that's great news!
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
dialog: If we're still alive tomorrow morning, I
dialog: want you to find another line of work.
text: Pause. Fox nods.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: A wide shot of the entire valley. There are thick woods,
text: green and yellow fields, two ponds, a small village, and a
text: river running through the middle.

scene_heading: EXT. HOLE. DAY
text: The entrance to a tunnel under a dirt mound covered with
text: holly bushes.
scene_heading: INT. HOLE. DAY
text: A small, comfortable kitchen off a living room with two
text: bedrooms behind it. Fox sits at the kitchen table reading a
text: newspaper called the Gazette. His fur has gone grey at the
text: temples, and he now wears a dark, double-breasted, pin-
text: striped suit with a conservative necktie. Mrs. Fox stands at
text: the counter-top stirring something in a bowl with a whisk.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 5.
text: She is dressed in a paint-splattered, cream-colored,
text: Victorian-style dress.
speaker_heading: INSERT:
text: A column in the newspaper with Fox's picture at the top of
text: it. The caption reads: Fox about Town with Fantastic Mr. Fox.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Does anybody actually read my column? Do
dialog: your friends ever talk about it?
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
scene_heading: (STILL STIRRING)
dialog: Of course. In fact, Rabbit's ex-
dialog: girlfriend just said to me last week, "I
dialog: should read Foxy's column," but they
dialog: don't get the Gazette.
text: (yelling into the next room)
dialog: Ash! Let's get cracking!
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Why would they? It's a rag-sheet.
speaker_heading: (SIGHS)
dialog: I want to say I hate my job, but that
dialog: would make it seem more important to me
dialog: than I want people to think it is.
text: Mrs. Fox puts down her bowl and starts slicing a loaf of
text: bread. A small, narrow fox cub comes out of one of the
text: bedrooms wearing white pants and no shirt. His hair is
text: smashed all onto one side sticking up wrong. He is Ash.
speaker_heading: ASH
dialog: I'm sick.
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
dialog: You're not sick.
speaker_heading: ASH
dialog: I have a temperature.
text: Mrs. Fox goes quickly over to Ash and puts her paw to his
text: forehead.
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
dialog: You don't have a temperature.
text: Ash turns away and says as he goes back into his bedroom:
speaker_heading: ASH
dialog: I don't want to go.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 6.
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
dialog: Hurry up. You're going to be late.
text: Mrs. Fox goes back into the kitchen and starts making toast
text: and coffee. Fox whispers to her:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: I love the way you handled that.
text: Mrs. Fox looks at Fox sideways. She says loudly to Ash:
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
dialog: Your cousin Kristofferson's coming first
dialog: thing tomorrow morning. I want you to be
dialog: extra nice to him, because he's going
dialog: through a very hard time right now, OK?
text: Ash comes back out of his bedroom. He now wears a white
text: cardigan and white socks with his white pants tucked into
text: them. He says aggressively:
speaker_heading: ASH
dialog: Where's he going to sleep?
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
dialog: We're going to make a bed for him in your
dialog: room tonight.
speaker_heading: ASH
dialog: I can't spare the space. Put him in Dad's
dialog: study.
text: Fox says without looking up from his newspaper:
speaker_heading: FOX
text: Dad's study is occupied by Dad.
text: Ash goes back into his bedroom. Fox lowers his newspaper. He
text: looks around the room. He says to Mrs. Fox:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: I don't want to live in a hole anymore.
dialog: It makes me feel poor.
text: Mrs. Fox stops buttering the toast. She looks to Fox and says
speaker_heading: SOFTLY:
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
dialog: We are poor -- but we're happy.
text: Fox twists his paw in the air, indicating:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 7.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Comme-ci, comme-ga. Anyway, the views are
text: better above ground.
text: Mrs. Fox nods. She brings Fox a plate of toast and a cup of
text: coffee. Fox takes her paw and says:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: I'm seven non-fox-years old now. My
dialog: father died at seven and a half. I don't
dialog: want to live in a hole anymore, and I'm
dialog: going to do something about it.
text: Fox kisses Mrs. Fox's paw. He suddenly eats three slices of
text: toast in a second and a half, savagely but neatly. He stands
text: and picks up his cup of coffee.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Well, I'm off.
text: Fox throws back the last of his coffee, kisses Mrs. Fox on
text: the back of her neck, grabs his briefcase, tucks his
text: newspaper under his arm, and walks to the door. He shouts
speaker_heading: CHEERILY:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Have a good day, my darlings!
text: Ash comes out the bedroom again. He has now added a white
text: cape to his ensemble and is in the middle of brushing his
text: teeth. There is toothpaste all over his mouth. He waves
text: briefly to Fox and goes back into his bedroom. Fox looks
text: puzzled.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: What's he wearing?
text: Mrs. Fox shrugs. She smiles sadly and waves to Fox. Fox waves
text: back. He starts to go out but pauses to look down at a folded
text: up section of his newspaper.
speaker_heading: INSERT:
text: A clipping from the real estate section. There is a
text: photograph of a wide, sprawling beech tree at the top of a
text: hill. A caption below it reads:
dialog: Tree Living, Great Views, Classic Beech
scene_heading: INT. TREE. DAY
text: A door opens into a wide, low space with peeling paint. There
text: is an old chair against the wall, a bare light bulb hanging
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 8.
text: from the ceiling, and a layer of dust over everything. A
text: skinny weasel in a khaki outfit immediately starts in as Fox
text: comes into the living room:
speaker_heading: WEASEL
dialog: Obviously, it's first growth, indigenous.
text: Original dirt floor, good bark, skipping
dialog: stone hearth --
text: Weasel is interrupted by a loud banging clank. He and Fox
text: peer into the next room. A heavy-set opossum with a cowlick
text: tinkers with some pipes under the kitchen sink. He is Kylie.
text: Weasel snaps at him:
speaker_heading: WEASEL
dialog: What'd I tell you? I'm showing the
dialog: property. You're not supposed to be here.
speaker_heading: KYLIE
dialog: (checking his watch)
dialog: Oh, cuss. What time is it? I'm sorry.
text: Weasel sighs. He waves his arm in Kylie's direction and says
text: distractedly, slightly annoyed:
speaker_heading: WEASEL
dialog: This is Kylie. He's the super.
dialog: (aside to Fix)
dialog: He's a little --
text: Weasel makes a fluttering gesture with his paw. Fox nods. He
text: points at a bucket on the floor next to Kylie among bolts,
text: tools, and washers.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: What's in the bucket, Mr. Kylie?
speaker_heading: KYLIE
speaker_heading: (HESITATES)
dialog: Just minnows. You want one?
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Certainly. Thank you.
text: Kylie reaches into his bucket and hands Fox a live, wriggling
text: minnow. Fox swallows it whole.
text: Fox stares out the window at three sprawling poultry
text: compounds in the distance. Black smoke pours out of a
text: farmhouse chimney on each property. A sign on a water tower
text: in the first compound reads Boggis Farms and has a picture of
text: a chicken on it. A sign on a silo in the second compound
text: reads Bunce Industries and has a picture of a goose on it. A
text: sign on a windmill in the third compound reads Bean, inc.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 9.
text: (since 1976) and has a picture of a turkey with an apple on
dialog: it.
text: Weasel says pointedly from across the room:
speaker_heading: WEASEL
dialog: May I ask what you do for a living, Mr.
dialog: Fox?
text: Fox's eyes narrow as he looks out, entranced, with his mouth
text: slightly open. He says almost inaudibly:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: I used to steal birds, but now I'm a
dialog: newspaper man.
speaker_heading: WEASEL
speaker_heading: (PLEASED)
dialog: Oh, sure. I've seen your by-line.
text: Fox snaps out of his reverie and says suddenly:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Good afternoon, gentlemen.
text: Fox shakes hands abruptly with Weasel and starts across the
text: room. Weasel is about to ask something when Fox stops in the
text: doorway, looks back, and says:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Oh, and Kylie -- thank you for the
dialog: minnow. It was superb.
text: Kylie smiles. Fox exits.
scene_heading: EXT. RIVER. DAY
text: A beaver dam across a bend in a fast stream. A still pond
text: sits above it. There is an entrance tunnel tucked beneath a
dialog: rock.
scene_heading: INT. BEAVER DAM. DAY
text: A large room of twig, stick, and mud construction. A card on
text: the door reads Badger, Beaver, and Stoat, L.L.P, Attorneys at
text: Law. An anxious badger sits at his desk reviewing some
text: documents. Fox paces the floor with his hands clasped behind
text: his back.
speaker_heading: BADGER
dialog: Don't buy this tree, Foxy. You're
dialog: borrowing at nine and a half, which
text: stinks like cuss, plus moving into the
dialog: most dangerous neighborhood in the

speaker_heading: BADGER (CONT'D)
dialog: country for someone of your type of
dialog: species.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: You're exaggerating, Badger.
speaker_heading: BADGER
speaker_heading: (YELLING)
dialog: Bull-cuss! I'm sugar-coating it, man!
text: This is Boggis, Bunce, and Bean! Three of
dialog: the meanest, nastiest, ugliest farmers in
dialog: the history of this valley!
text: An uneasy otter secretary peers in at them from the outer
text: office. Fox looks intrigued.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Really? Tell me about them.
text: Silence. Badger sighs. He loosens his tie and settles in.
speaker_heading: BADGER
dialog: All right...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: A fat man with a huge moustache. He wears a tweed suit which
text: stretches at the buttons so much that they look like they are
text: about to snap off. He holds a carbine rifle. He stands in
text: front of his farm, which contains row upon row of chicken
text: houses. He has an ugly face. He is Boggis.
speaker_heading: BADGER (V.0.)
text: Walter Boggis is a chicken farmer.
dialog: Probably the most successful in the
dialog: world.
scene_heading: INT. BOGGIS' KITCHEN. DAY
text: Boggis sits at a chopping block tearing into a boiled chicken
text: with a fork and a meat cleaver.
speaker_heading: BADGER (V.0.)
text: He's unbelievably fat -- which maybe is
text: genetic -- but he also eats three boiled
text: chickens smothered with dumplings every
dialog: day for breakfast, lunch, supper, and
dialog: dessert. That's twelve in total, per
dialog: diem.
speaker_heading: INSERT:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 11.
text: Boggis' ear. Furry black and white hairs grow out of it. A
text: fly buzzes around, lands on it, and crawls inside. Boggis
text: sticks his pinky in after it and scratches.
speaker_heading: BADGER (V.0.)
text: He never takes a bath, as a result of
text: which his ear holes are clogged with all
text: kinds of muck and wax and bits of chewing
text: gum and dead flies and so on.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: A short, overweight man with one slightly wandering eye. He
text: wears overalls and a cap. He holds a twelve-gauge shotgun. He
text: stands in front of his farm, which consists of several long
text: buildings in rows like a factory. He has a nasty face. He is
dialog: Bunce.
speaker_heading: BADGER (V.0.)
text: Nathan Bunce is a duck and goosefarmer.
dialog: He owns about 2 million ducksand 500,000
dialog: geese. You might say he's kind ofa pot-
text: bellied dwarf of some kind.
scene_heading: EXT. SWIMMING POOL. DAY
text: Bunce stands up to his nose in water. The depth reads 4FT.
speaker_heading: BADGER (V.0.)
text: He's so short his chin would probably be
text: under water in the shallow end of any
text: swimming pool on the planet.
scene_heading: INT. BUNCE'S KITCHEN. DAY
text: Bunce sits on two stacked telephone books on a chair. He guts
text: a dead goose, cutting out its liver and mashing it with a
text: fork. A plate of doughnuts cools on the table.
speaker_heading: BADGER (V.0.)
text: He eats only doughnuts with smashed-up
text: goose livers injected into them.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: A tall, skinny man in a long trench-coat. He holds a Luger
text: pistol. He stands in front of his farm, which is an apple
text: orchard that stretches over thousands of acres. He has a mean
text: face. He is Bean.
speaker_heading: BADGER (V.0.)
dialog: Franklin Bean is a turkey and apple
text: farmer. He keeps his birds in an orchard

speaker_heading: BADGER (V.0.) (cont'd)
text: where they run around squawking and
text: gobbling, surrounded by apples.
text: Bean aims his Luger and shoots a humming bird. Crazy turkeys
text: run about among the trees.
scene_heading: INT. BEAN'S SHED. DAY
text: Bean works at a moonshine-type cider still, boiling chemicals
text: and sipping from a bottle.
speaker_heading: BADGER (V.0.)
text: He's probably anorexic, because he never
text: eats anything. He's on a liquid diet of
text: strong, alcoholic cider, which he makes
text: from his apples. He's as skinny as a
text: pencil, as smart as a whip -- and easily
dialog: the biggest cusshole I've ever met in my
dialog: life.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Fox and Badger in Badger's office.
speaker_heading: BADGER
dialog: In summation, I think you just got to not
dialog: do it, man. That's all.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: I understand what you're saying, and your
dialog: comments are valuable, but I'm going to
dialog: ignore your advice.
text: Badger leaps out of his chair and slams the office door. He
text: points his finger at Fox and screams:
speaker_heading: BADGER
dialog: The cuss you are!
speaker_heading: FOX
speaker_heading: (IN DISBELIEF)
dialog: The cuss am I?
text: Fox jumps up and points back at Badger, screaming:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Don't cussing point at me!
speaker_heading: BADGER
speaker_heading: (SCREAMING)
dialog: Are you cussing with me?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: FOX
speaker_heading: (SCREAMING)
dialog: Do I look like I'm cussing with you?
text: Fox and Badger begin to snarl and snap savagely, knocking
text: into the furniture as they circle around the room pointing in
text: each other's faces. Suddenly, they calm down all at once,
text: sighing deeply. Pause.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: One last thing: something's probably
dialog: about to happen to me at work which I
dialog: can't put my finger on but have a funny
dialog: feeling about. How can I protect myself
dialog: legally?
speaker_heading: BADGER
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: Are you about to get fired?
speaker_heading: FOX
speaker_heading: (SHRUGS)
text: Slash quit.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: A door with a frosted glass window. Letters painted on it
text: read Gazette, Editor-in-Chief, Phillip Squirrel. Fox's
text: silhouette stands across from that of a small squirrel
text: sitting at a desk. The squirrel's silhouette says in a
scene_heading: GRAVELLY VOICE:
speaker_heading: SQUIRREL
dialog: You're fired.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Slash I quit. Here's my letter of
dialog: resignation.
text: Fox's silhouette throws an envelope onto the squirrel's desk.
speaker_heading: MONTAGE:
text: Two muskrats in orange moving company uniforms unloads boxes
text: and furniture from a wagon and carries them into the tree.
text: Fox holds open the front door and barks orders at them.
text: Two muskrats in white painter's uniforms paints the walls of
text: the living room and the trim around the windows with rollers
text: and brushes. Fox stands on the drop-cloth and barks orders at
dialog: them.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 14.
text: Two muskrats in blue electrician's uniforms work in the
text: kitchen. Mrs. Fox watches over their shoulders and barks
text: orders at them.
text: Fox holds up a pair of flowered curtains in front of a
text: window. He looks to Mrs. Fox. She stares at the curtains
text: thoughtfully. She raises an eyebrow.
text: Fox and Mrs. Fox sit in the windowsill looking out at the
text: sunset. Ash stands in-between them. The flowered curtains
text: wave in the breeze. Fox puffs on a pipe. Ash blows a soap
text: bubble. Mrs. Fox puts out her paw and a butterfly lands on
text: it. She smiles at Fox. He puts his arm around her. He raises
text: a pair of binoculars to his eyes.
speaker_heading: INSERT:
text: A binocular shot of an industrial shack with Boggis Chicken
text: House #1 stencilled on the front of it.
text: Fox lowers the binoculars. His eyes sparkle.
scene_heading: EXT. TREE. DAY
text: Ash stands poised on a high branch over an inflatable
text: swimming pool printed with a red-tartan plaid pattern. He
text: wears over-sized swim trunks with a pattern of acorns printed
text: on them. Fox sits in the grass eating an apple below with
text: Mrs. Fox. She is painting at an easel. Ash yells:
speaker_heading: ASH
dialog: Watch this, Dad!
text: Fox looks up. Ash leaps into the air and does a spectacularly
text: awkward back-flip during which he appears to have four arms
text: and three legs randomly attached to his body, flailing
text: wildly. He hits the water by the side of his head and smacks
text: into the surface back-first with a pained yelp. Fox grimaces.
text: He claps mildly.
text: (NOTE: an alternate version of Ash with four arms and three
text: legs randomly attached to his body will be used for this
dialog: stunt.)
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Good jump, Ash! Remember to keep your
dialog: tail tucked!
text: Fox looks at Mrs. Fox's canvas. It is a picture of the pond
text: and landscape in severe weather with black clouds and
text: lightning bolts. It is signed Felicity Fox. Fox raises an
text: eyebrow.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: FOX
text: Still painting thunderstorms, I see.
text: Fox sees a small, Samsonite suitcase on the ground next to a
text: pair of yellow sneakers. He frowns.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Whose suitcase is that?
text: A boy's voice shouts from the high tree branch:
speaker_heading: KRISTOFFERSON
dialog: Hello, everyone! Good afternoon!
text: Fox, Mrs. Fox, and Ash look up, surprised. A second Fox cub
text: stands poised on the edge of the limb. He is taller, leaner,
text: sleeker, and it is immediately apparent even by his posture
text: infinitely more graceful than Ash. He is Kristofferson. He
text: wears a professional Speedo with a patch on it that says Swim
text: Team. Fox brightens.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Kristofferson! Welcome to our little
dialog: tree! I see you brought your swimming
dialog: trunks!
text: Kristofferson steps off the branch and performs a reserved
text: but perfect jack-knife. He enters the water splashlessly. Fox
text: leaps to his feet, applauding with his paws above his head,
text: whistling and hollering:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Look at that! This kid's a natural! I'm
text: speechless, Kristofferson!
text: Kristofferson smiles modestly and shrugs. Ash stares at him
text: stonily. Fox turns to Mrs. Fox.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Plus, he knows karate.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM. EVENING
text: Fox sits in his armchair reading the Gazette. Ash sits on a
text: braided rug on the floor beside him reading a comic book
text: called The Adventures of White Cape. On the cover, there is a
text: picture of a ferret leaping off a motorcycle. Mrs. Fox is in
text: the kitchen in the background flattening a hunk of dough with
text: a rolling pin. Kristofferson is in the next room practicing

dialog: Well, you know, I think I'm an athlete,
dialog: and sometimes I feel like you guys don't
dialog: see me that way.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: What's the sub-text here?
text: Ash thinks for a minute. He looks at Kristofferson in the
text: next room. Kristofferson is now sitting Indian-style on the
text: floor meditating. His paws are turned upward with his thumbs
text: touching his index fingers forming a ring. Ash says loudly to
text: Mrs. Fox in the kitchen:
speaker_heading: ASH
dialog: How long is Kristofferson supposed to
dialog: stay with us?
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
dialog: Until your uncle gets better.
speaker_heading: ASH
dialog: Right, but roughly how long do we plan to
dialog: give him on that? Double-pneumonia isn't
dialog: even really that big of a deal, is it?
text: In the background, Kristofferson stands up again and starts
text: practicing violent karate kicks. Mrs. Fox leans into the
text: doorway and whispers forcefully:
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
dialog: As a matter of fact, it is. He's lucky to
dialog: be alive. Now --
speaker_heading: ASH
dialog: Right, but --
text: Kristofferson yells suddenly as he does a spinning double-
text: kick with a chop:
speaker_heading: KRISTOFFERSON
dialog: Ki-ya!
text: Everyone looks startled. Kristofferson resumes his tae-kwon-
text: do practice with an angry, wounded look on his face. Mrs. Fox
scene_heading: SAYS COLDLY:

dialog: 17.
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
dialog: Lower your voice, Ash.
scene_heading: EXT. TREE. NIGHT
text: Fox and Kylie sit in a porch swing on one of the middle
text: branches of Fox's tree. They drink cups of coffee. Crickets
text: chirp.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Kids are crazy, aren't they? You got to
dialog: try it, though. Raising a family.
speaker_heading: KYLIE
dialog: Yeah. Sometimes I feel like maybe I
speaker_heading: MIGHT --
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: What do you think of this tree, by the
dialog: way? It's great, huh?
speaker_heading: KYLIE
speaker_heading: (HESITATES)
dialog: Yeah. No, I was just saying how some-
speaker_heading: TIMES --
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: I have one last part of what I was about
dialog: to say.
speaker_heading: KYLIE
dialog: OK. Go ahead.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: I'm going broke. You want to help me
dialog: steal some chickens?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Fox's study, the next morning. A map of the valley with notes
text: and arrows written all over it is spread across a desk. The
text: door is closed with a towel jammed under it. A cricket match
text: plays loudly on the radio. Fox sits in his armchair. Kylie
text: sits in a creaky rocking chair.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: I used to do this professionally, and I
dialog: was very successful at it. I had to get
dialog: out of it for personal reasons, but I've
dialog: decided to secretly quit my job slash got
dialog: fired to pursue it again. I'm bringing
dialog: you in as my secretary and personal
dialog: assistant.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: KYLIE
dialog: OK!
speaker_heading: FOX
speaker_heading: (PRICKLY)
dialog: This is actually kind of a big deal, so
dialog: don't just say, "OK!"
speaker_heading: KYLIE
dialog: OK. Well, thank you.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: (clearing is throat)
dialog: I'm going totape this formyrecords,so
dialog: don't make a lot of sounds --meaning
dialog: stop rocking.
speaker_heading: KYLIE
speaker_heading: (DEFENSIVELY)
dialog: Well, maybe we ought to turn off the
dialog: radio, then. That's noisier than --
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: I don't want people to eavesdrop on us,
dialog: Kylie. Let me just tell this.
text: Kylie stops rocking. Fox presses record on a tape recorder.
speaker_heading: HE BEGINS:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Master Plan. Phase one. Side A.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: That night. Fox stands on a rock at the edge of the woods
text: looking through his binoculars. He lowers them and gives a
text: hand-signal. Kylie joins him, and they start out along the
text: moonlit ridge. Fox wears a dark car-coat and a black cap.
text: Kylie has on a navy ski-hat.
speaker_heading: FOX (V.0.)
dialog: We'll start with Boggis' Chicken House
text: #1. His only security is a few old
text: hunting beagles and a low stone wall. Now
dialog: a word about beagles: never look a beagle
text: directly in the eye. And if --
speaker_heading: KYLIE (V.0.)
speaker_heading: (INTERRUPTING)
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 19.
text: Fox and Kylie in Fox's study earlier that afternoon. Kylie
scene_heading: SAYS BLITHELY:
speaker_heading: KYLIE
dialog: Beagles aren't so tough.
speaker_heading: FOX
speaker_heading: (ANNOYED)
dialog: Yeah? Well, first of all, one of these
text: beagles has chronic rabies, which he's on
dialog: medication for, and if you get bit by him
dialog: you have to get shots in your stomach for
dialog: six months. And, second -- listen, I'm
dialog: not going to justify this to you. Just
dialog: pay attention and stop interrupting me.
dialog: I'm taping this.
scene_heading: EXT. RAVINE. NIGHT
text: Fox and Kylie shimmy down a steep embankment and cross a
dialog: stream.
speaker_heading: FOX (V.0.)
dialog: I picked some blueberries, butterflied
text: them with a scalpel, and laced each one
dialog: with ten milligrams of high-potency
text: sleeping powder.
speaker_heading: INSERT:
text: Fox's paws meticulously sprinkle a powdered mickey into a
text: dissected blueberry and stitch it shut with red thread.
speaker_heading: FOX (V.0.)
text: Enough to tranquilize a charging gorilla.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Fox and Kylie in Fox's study earlier that afternoon. They now
text: smoke pipes.
speaker_heading: KYLIE
dialog: How do we make them eat it?
speaker_heading: FOX
text: (smiling, with utter certainty)
dialog: Beagles love blueberries.
scene_heading: EXT. RIDGE. NIGHT
text: Fox and Kylie push through a bramble and climb to the top of
text: an elderberry bush. Fox looks through his binoculars.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: FOX (V.O.)
dialog: If we approach with the wind in our
dialog: faces, we'll smell the chicken livers on
text: Boggis' breath from at least fifty yards
dialog: away.
scene_heading: EXT. BARNYARD. DAY
text: Seventy-five chickens stand around quietly but anxiously,
text: darting wildly nervous looks at one another. They eat bits of
text: grain off the ground.
speaker_heading: FOX (V.O.)
dialog: Remember: they aren't very smart, but
dialog: they're incredibly paranoid -- so always
text: kill a chicken in one bite.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Fox and Kylie in Fox's study earlier that afternoon. They now
text: drink whiskey sours. Fox repeats:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: One bite, get it?
text: Fox waits for Kylie to respond. Kylie does not. Fox frowns.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Are you listening to me? I look into your
dialog: eyes and I can't tell whether you're
dialog: getting anything I'm saying.
text: Kylie stares at Fox vacantly. He shrugs.
dialog: (NOTE: an alternate set of eyeballs will be used for any
text: shots indicating Kylie's vacant look.)
scene_heading: EXT. MEADOW. NIGHT
text: Fox and Kylie move swiftly through the tall grass. Fox pauses
text: to sniff the air. He nods.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: A few beagles, as we discussed, but we're
dialog: ready for that.
text: Fox and Kylie cross a dirt lane and come out of a shallow
text: ditch. Fox licks the pinky of his paw and holds it up in the
dialog: air.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: You feel that? The wind's in our faces.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 21.
text: Kylie touches his face with his paw. He nods. Fox and Kylie
text: run along the edge of the ditch. Kylie says casually:
speaker_heading: KYLIE
dialog: Yeah, back in the old days, didn't they
dialog: used to do a thing where if somebody saw
dialog: a wolf, and --
speaker_heading: FOX
speaker_heading: (STARTLED)
dialog: What wolf?
text: Fox stops in his tracks. His eyes dart about. Kylie looks at
text: him curiously.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Oh, nothing? Never mind.
text: Fox and Kylie veer off into shorter grasses. Fox points
text: ahead, regaining his composure:
speaker_heading: FOX
text: Here comes the low stone wall. Not a
dialog: problem.
text: Fox and Kylie climb over a low stone wall and find themselves
text: at the base of a chain-link fence eleven feet high.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: This is a chain-link fence, I guess. Did
dialog: I not remember this? Maybe it's new.
dialog: Let's pause.
speaker_heading: (SUDDENLY ANGRY)
dialog: What the cuss? Where'd this giant fence
dialog: come from? We had a master plan!
text: Kylie motions to a yellow, plywood lightning bolt posted to
text: the fence.
speaker_heading: KYLIE
dialog: What's this lightning bolt stand for?
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Give me a second! I said, "Let's pause"!
text: Pause. Fox pulls himself together. He turns to look at the
text: plywood lightning bolt.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: That, I guess, hypothetically, could mean
dialog: maybe this fence might be electric.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: KYLIE
dialog: Well, I just hope it doesn't mean
dialog: thunder. I have a phobia of that.
text: Fox and Kylie climb a tree and crouch at the end of one of
text: its branches. Fox produces a zip-loc bag filled with
text: blueberries with white thread stitched into them.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Watch this.
text: Fox puts a blueberry into the end of a straw and shoots it
text: out into the barnyard.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: The blueberry landing on the ground in front of Chicken House
text: #1. A beagle approaches it and sniffs at it. He eats it. He
text: looks very pleased. He falls over, out cold.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Fox with an ecstatic expression on his face. He rapidly
text: shoots more and more blueberries across the barnyard. Beagles
text: eat blueberries and fall over, one after another. Fox and
text: Kylie drop down into the barnyard and head for Chicken House
text: #1. Fox whispers excitedly as they run:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Beagles love blueberries! Didn't I tell
dialog: you? The master plan's working again!
text: Kylie raises his fist enthusiastically and trips over an
text: unconscious beagle. He picks himself up quickly, and they
text: weave among the rest of the beagles. They reach the entrance
text: to the chicken house, open the door, and duck inside.
text: Pause. There is an eruption of crazed squawking, screaming,
text: and fighting from inside. The chicken house rumbles. Lights
text: jolt on across the compound. An alarm goes off. Voices yell.
text: The chicken house door swings open again, and Fox and Kylie
text: emerge among a cloud of feathers. Fox carries two dead
text: chickens, and Kylie has one live one. Fox yells:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: I said one bite, cuss it!
speaker_heading: KYLIE
dialog: I'm trying! I have a different kind of
dialog: teeth from you! I'm an opossum!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 23.
text: Kylie tries to bite the chicken on the neck. The chicken is
text: unharmed. Kylie shrugs. Fox kills the chicken with one quick
text: flick of the jaws. Kylie looks horrified.
speaker_heading: KYLIE
text: That's so grisly! There's blood and
dialog: everything!
speaker_heading: FOX
speaker_heading: (DEFENSIVELY)
dialog: We're killing chickens! There's going to
dialog: be blood in this story! Follow me!
text: Fox and Kylie dash to the electric fence. They stop in front
text: of it. Kylie looks to Fox.
speaker_heading: KYLIE
dialog: What's the master escape plan?
text: Fox hesitates, confused. A gunshot fires from among the
text: chicken houses. Fox shouts to Kylie:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Follow me again!
text: Fox and Kylie run back across the barnyard, past the beagles
text: as they begin to wake up and stagger around. Farmhands
text: appear, loading shotguns and running into the confusion. Fox
text: and Kylie race by, unnoticed, among them. They dart into the
text: house through a flap in the back door. The lights are out in
text: the kitchen. They take a moment, breathing hard in the
text: darkness. Kylie shakes his head in disbelief.
speaker_heading: KYLIE
dialog: Wow. That was amazing. How did we do
dialog: that? We ran the other way or something.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: KYLIE
dialog: What happens now?
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: I have no idea.
text: Fox opens the door-flap a crack. He looks out and sees Boggis
text: opening the front gate to let out his beagles and farmhands,
text: barking and shooting, as they search for the intruders. Fox
dialog: shouts to Kylie:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Holy cuss! They opened the gate! Follow
dialog: me again!
text: Lightning quick, Fox and Kylie burst out through the door-
text: flap, race across the barnyard, and dart through the open
text: gate. Up the road, Boggis screams furiously as he runs with
text: his pack of beagles and farmhands. Fox and Kylie fly into the
text: bushes. As they race through the underbrush Fox says
scene_heading: BREATHLESSLY:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Let's hit the five and dime on the way
dialog: home! We need to make some fake price
dialog: tags and wrap these chickens in wax-paper
dialog: so it looks like we got them at the
dialog: butcher shop!
text: Fox and Kylie howl ecstatically.
speaker_heading: MONTAGE:
text: A fox's paw lifts a silver dome off a perfectly roasted
text: chicken with an apple in its mouth.
text: Fox and Mrs. Fox sit at a candle-lit table eating chicken and
text: drinking wine. Ash, Kristofferson, and Kylie sit at a
text: slightly miniature table eating chicken and drinking milk.
text: Fox laughs hysterically as he tells his wife a story. Wine
text: comes out of his nose.
text: Fox and Kylie dash out the door of Boggis' Chicken House #7
text: carrying three more dead chickens. Lights jolt on. Farmhands
text: run out firing shotguns. Fox and Kylie escape through a hole
text: cut into the electric fence.
text: Fox and Kylie dash out the window of Bunce's Poultry Barn C
text: carrying two dead ducks and a goose. Alarms ring. Farmhands
text: run out firing pistols. Fox and Kylie escape through a hole
text: knocked into a brick wall.
text: Fox and Kylie dash out the gates of Bean's Apple Orchard XII
text: carrying two dead turkeys and a basket of apples. Automatic
text: doors close. Farmhands run out firing rifles. Fox and Kylie
text: escape through a hole chopped into a burning barricade.
text: Fox and Kylie run full-speed through a clover field in the
text: dark. The camera zooms in slowly on their faces as they ford
text: a stream, leap a fallen hawthorn, and cross into the willow
text: glade. They look exhilarated.

dialog: 25.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN. EVENING
text: Mrs. Fox studies a crayon price-tag labelled $4 attached to a
text: wax-paper-wrapped parcel. She opens the parcel and holds up a
text: dead chicken by the leg. There is a small metal clip around
text: its ankle. She examines it. She frowns.
text: Fox comes in, grabs an apple out of a bowl, and starts back
text: out of the room.
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
dialog: Where'd you get this chicken?
speaker_heading: FOX
speaker_heading: (SHRUGS)
dialog: I picked it up at the Five-and-Dime last
dialog: night on my way back from --
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
dialog: It's got a Boggis Farms tag around its
dialog: ankle.
speaker_heading: FOX
speaker_heading: (HESITATES)
dialog: Huh. Must've escaped from there before I
dialog: bought it.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM. EVENING
text: Ash, Kristofferson, and Kylie sit at the children's table
text: eating dinner. Next to Ash, there is a small, slightly beaten-
text: up statue of a fox with his front legs raised in the air
text: holding a medal above his head. Kylie points at it.
speaker_heading: KYLIE
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: ASH
dialog: This? Nothing. Just some old trophy I won
dialog: for being an athlete.
text: Fox and Mrs. Fox sit at the adults' table. Fox guzzles down a
text: last sip of wine and says with his mouth full of food:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: I'm supposed to cover this book party at
text: some animal's nest in a tobacco field
dialog: down the hill, so me and Kylie are going
text: to hop over there and give it a whirl.
dialog: Don't wait up.
text: Fox pulls his napkin out of his collar, drops it on the
text: table, and stands up. Mrs. Fox asks cooly:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 26.
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
dialog: What's the book?
speaker_heading: FOX
speaker_heading: (HESITATES)
dialog: Some memoir. I'll get him to sign you a
dialog: copy.
text: Fox kisses Mrs. Fox on the cheek. She looks at him
dialog: suspiciously.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Dinner was --
dialog: (doing a little gesture)
dialog: -- pitch-perfect.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS. NIGHT
text: Fox and Kylie walk among the trees. They are dressed in their
text: prowling outfits.
speaker_heading: FOX
text: I spotted a couple of broken burglar bars
text: underneath the back door to Bean's secret
text: cider cellar.
speaker_heading: KYLIE
dialog: We're breaking into Bean's house?
speaker_heading: FOX
speaker_heading: (HESITATES)
dialog: Cellar.
speaker_heading: KYLIE
dialog: Where he lives?
speaker_heading: FOX
speaker_heading: (HESITATES)
text: Where he keeps the cider.
speaker_heading: ASH
speaker_heading: (BRIGHTLY)
text: Below where he lives.
text: Ash, dressed in his own prowling outfit, is walking with Fox
text: and Kylie. Fox stops short:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Where'd you come from? Go back to the
dialog: tree and do your homework!
speaker_heading: ASH
dialog: I want to help you steal some cider.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: FOX
speaker_heading: (ANGRILY)
dialog: We're going to a book party! And keep
dialog: your mouth shut about any cider, because
dialog: no one ever said that! Get out of here!
speaker_heading: ASH
dialog: But Dad --
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: But nothing! You're going to get me in a
dialog: lot of trouble!
text: The three animals stand in silence for a minute. Fox points
text: to his tree. Ash turns and starts back home. Fox shakes his
dialog: head.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Where the cuss does that kid get off? Can
dialog: you believe that? How'd he get tipped
dialog: off? You think he's going to tell on us?
text: Fox turns to Kylie. Kylie looks back at him vacantly.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Before we go any further, from now on can
dialog: you give me some kind of signal once in a
dialog: while just so I know any of this is
dialog: getting through to you?
text: Pause. Kylie makes a slight motion with his paw. Fox
text: hesitates.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Was that it? OK.
scene_heading: EXT. BARNYARD. NIGHT
text: Fox and Kylie dart across the yard and around the back of
text: Bean's farmhouse. Kylie whispers as they run:
speaker_heading: KYLIE
dialog: One time this wolf --
speaker_heading: FOX
speaker_heading: (IRRITATED)
dialog: What's with all the wolf talk? Can we
dialog: give it a rest, for once?
text: Fox climbs onto a garbage pail and pulls open a window
text: shutter. He and Kylie shimmy in-between two bent burglar
dialog: bars.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 28.
scene_heading: INT. BEAN'S SECRET CIDER CELLAR. NIGHT
text: A vast, damp, gloomy cellar with hundreds of glass jars
text: stacked from floor to ceiling. Each jar is marked Cider. Fox
text: and Kylie come inside and quietly drop to the brick floor.
scene_heading: KYLIE WHISPERS:
speaker_heading: KYLIE
dialog: Look at all this apple juice.
speaker_heading: FOX
speaker_heading: (STERNLY)
dialog: Apple juice? Apple juice? We didn't come
dialog: here for apple juice. This is some of the
dialog: strongest, finest alcoholic cider money
dialog: can buy -- or that can even be stolen. It
dialog: burns in your throat, boils in your
text: stomach, and tastes almost exactly like
text: pure, melted gold.
speaker_heading: (SUDDENLY)
dialog: Let's crack open one these 'shine jars
dialog: and do a shooter.
text: A match strikes in the darkness. Fox and Kylie look around
text: the room frantically. On the highest shelf, peering out from
text: behind a huge jar, they see an enormous rat in a striped
text: shirt with a lit match in his claw. He puts the flame in his
text: mouth to snuff it out and holds the matchstick in his teeth.
text: He is longer than a fox and wiry, but with a small pot-belly.
text: He wears a black beret and moves like a beatnik.
text: He takes a draw from a small rubber tube inserted in the neck
text: of his cider jar. He says with a slightly sinister New
scene_heading: ORLEANS ACCENT:
speaker_heading: RAT
dialog: Y'all are trespassin', now. Illegally.
dialog: 'Round these parts, we don't take kindly
dialog: to cider poachers.
text: Fox and Rat stare at each other. Fox says, finally:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: You've aged badly, Rat.
speaker_heading: RAT
dialog: You're gettin' a little long in the
dialog: tooth, yourself, partner.
text: Rat spins around and hurls himself scuttling over a shelf,
text: down the wall, and through the air onto the brick floor at
text: Fox's feet. He flicks open a switchblade and brandishes it.
text: He hisses.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 29.
text: Kylie shrieks and darts into a hole where a brick is missing
text: in the wall. Fox takes an old-fashioned boxing stance.
speaker_heading: RAT
dialog: How's your old lady doin'?
text: Kylie peers out from his hole in the wall nervously. Fox and
text: Rat circle each other slowly.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Do you refer to my wife?
speaker_heading: RAT
dialog: She was the town tart, in her day. Wild
text: and foot-loose and pretty as a mink
dialog: stole. She was a creme brulee -- until
dialog: you made an honest woman out of her, Mr.
dialog: Fox.
text: Kylie says, intrigued, from his hole:
speaker_heading: KYLIE
dialog: Is that true?
speaker_heading: FOX
speaker_heading: (ANNOYED)
dialog: Of course, not. I mean, certainly, she
dialog: lived. We all did. It was a different
dialog: time. Let's not use a double-standard.
dialog: She marched against the --
speaker_heading: KYLIE
dialog: But town tart?
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Shut up.
text: Rat lunges at Fox with his switchblade. Fox dodges nimbly. He
text: cocks an eyebrow and smiles:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: That was close, Rat. Be careful.
speaker_heading: RAT
dialog: Oh, I'm as careful as a --
text: A door at the top of the stairs opens suddenly with a loud
text: creak. Rat and Fox look terrified. They both dart away and
text: hide behind cider jars.
text: A heavy-set, middle-aged housekeeper carrying a rolling pin
text: comes down the stairs and walks straight over to the shelf
text: where Fox is hiding.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 30.
scene_heading: HOUSEKEEPER
dialog: How many jars should I bring up, ma'am?
text: A strong, almost masculine woman's voice answers from
speaker_heading: UPSTAIRS:
scene_heading: MASCULINE VOICE
dialog: I don't know. Two, I guess.
text: The housekeeper grabs the two jars directly next to the one
text: Fox is hiding behind and tucks them under her arm. Fox tenses
text: his body. He shivers slightly. A graze of the red fur of his
text: arm sticks out barely from behind his jar. The housekeeper
text: hesitates.
scene_heading: HOUSEKEEPER
dialog: He drank three yesterday, ma'am.
scene_heading: MASCULINE VOICE
dialog: All right, take three.
text: The housekeeper grabs Fox's jar. Fox closes his eyes.
scene_heading: MASCULINE VOICE
dialog: No, don't.
text: The housekeeper stops with her hand on the neck of Fox's jar.
scene_heading: MASCULINE VOICE
text: Three's too many. It's unhealthy. He's
dialog: anorexic. Bring two.
text: The housekeeper lets go of Fox's jar. Fox relaxes slightly.
text: The housekeeper grabs Fox's jar again. Fox tenses up.
scene_heading: HOUSEKEEPER
dialog: But maybe, just in case --
scene_heading: MASCULINE VOICE
dialog: Two's plenty.
text: The housekeeper lets go of Fox's jar and walks away. She goes
text: back up the stairs and closes the door. Kylie says in the
speaker_heading: DARKNESS:
speaker_heading: KYLIE
dialog: Oh, my cuss. That was like a scene out of
dialog: A --
text: The door opens again. An exceptionally tall, powerfully built
text: woman in a black dress and Wellingtons, with grey hair pulled-
text: back in a bun, bright green eyes, and a meat cleaver tucked
text: under her apron strings comes swiftly down the stairs. She
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 31.
text: eyeballs the corners of the room. She is Mrs. Bean. She says
text: thickly (in her masculine voice):
speaker_heading: MRS. BEAN
dialog: To whom it may concern: if I catch a rat
text: in a black beret drinking Mr. Bean's
text: secret cider without his express
dialog: permission, I intend to chop said rat's
text: head off, brine it, pickle it, and bake
text: it in a vermin casserole. I hope this
dialog: clarifies my position on the matter.
dialog: Sincerely, Evelyn Bean.
text: Mrs. Bean turns and goes back up the stairs. She closes the
text: door. Pause. Rat's voice says from the shadows:
speaker_heading: RAT
dialog: Dear Mrs. Bean, your language, while
text: somewhat purple, is nevertheless
text: impossible to misinterpret. However --
dialog: comma -- given the proximity of said rat
dialog: at the moment of your --
text: The door at the top the stairs opens again. Silence.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Fox and Kylie running away from Bean's farmhouse with two
text: jars of cider. They both look badly shaken. A gunshot rings
dialog: out taking us to:
scene_heading: EXT. BEAN FARMS. NIGHT
text: Bean is standing darkly in his front doorway. Smoke drifts
text: from the end of his Luger, pointed at the ceiling. A broken
text: light bulb hangs from a wire above his head. Boggis and Bunce
text: sit together on the porch in rocking chairs, startled,
text: staring at Bean.
speaker_heading: BEAN
dialog: I'm going to give a speech, and at the
dialog: end of it -- I'm going to throw a twist
dialog: into this plot.
text: Bean lights a cigarette and begins to walk slowly around the
text: porch.
speaker_heading: BEAN
dialog: First truth: this is the most ambitious
dialog: fox we've ever encountered, bar none.

speaker_heading: BEAN
dialog: Second truth: the meaning of ambition is
text: defined in the dictionary.
text: Bean jumps and rolls and shoots out a third light bulb.
speaker_heading: BEAN
dialog: Third truth: the weakness of the
dialog: ambitious man is his Achilles heel --
text: Bean quickly shoots out three more light bulbs behind his
text: back, over his shoulder, and between his legs. The porch goes
text: dark. He flicks on a flashlight and points it in his two
text: colleague's faces. They look scared. Bean says urgently:
speaker_heading: BEAN
dialog: -- but I've already figured out where
dialog: this fox lives, and tomorrow night we're
text: going to camp in the bushes, wait for him
text: to come out of the hole in his tree, and

dialog: grab you, fellas?
text: Boggis and Bunce hesitate. They nod and murmur their
dialog: approval.
scene_heading: INT. FOX'S TREE. NIGHT
text: Fox and Kylie come quietly into the half-lit kitchen dressed
text: in their prowling outfits. They walk to the door.
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
dialog: Another book party?
text: Fox and Kylie turn around, startled. Mrs. Fox sits on a stool
text: in the darkened pantry.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Woah! I didn't see you. Sitting in the
dialog: dark over there. Yeah, no. Actually,
dialog: there's a fire. I just got the call. They
dialog: said maybe it's arson? I got to interview
dialog: the marshall and see what's --
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
dialog: Kylie, is he telling the truth?
speaker_heading: KYLIE
speaker_heading: (FREAKING OUT)
dialog: I don't want to be put in the middle of

speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: Thanks, Kylie.
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
dialog: If what I think is happening is
scene_heading: HAPPENING --
speaker_heading: (OMINOUSLY)
dialog: -- it better not be.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Boggis, Bunce, and Bean waiting crouched in the bushes. Bean
text: licks his finger and holds it up to test the direction of the
text: wind. He nods, points to his nose, and gives a thumbs-up to
text: Boggis and Bunce.
scene_heading: EXT. FOX'S TREE. NIGHT
text: Fox pokes his head up out of his hole. He sniffs once. He
text: moves an inch forward and stops. He sniffs again. He waits a
text: moment and listens. He steps out of the hole and says
scene_heading: STONILY:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Nice job covering for me. Next time
speaker_heading: TRY --
text: A twig snaps. Fox freezes.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Boggis, Bunce, and Bean frozen in the bushes.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: The branches of the trees as the wind suddenly changes its
dialog: direction.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Fox on high alert. He rapidly sniffs the air three times in a
text: row. He turns to a confused Kylie and says, panicking:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: All three!
text: Fox and Kylie spin around and dart back into the hole as
text: Boggis, Bunce, and Bean open fire wildly from the bushes. A
text: barrage of bullets and buckshot rips into the tree-bark.
dialog: Silence.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 34.
text: Smoke from the three guns floats upward in the night air.
text: Boggis, Bunce, and Bean approach the tree. Bean shines his
text: flashlight on Fox's hole.
text: In the circle of light on the ground lies the tattered, blood-
text: stained remains of Fox's tail. Bean picks it up and holds it
text: in the air in front of Boggis and Bunce.
speaker_heading: BEAN
dialog: We got the tail, but we missed the fox.
text: Pause. Bean takes out his walkie-talkie.
speaker_heading: BEAN
dialog: Petey? You and the boys sober up and get
dialog: out here on the A.S.A.P. Bring eleven
text: shovels, three pick-axes, 500 rounds of
text: ammunition, and a bottle of apple cider.
scene_heading: INT. FOX'S TREE. NIGHT
text: Mrs. Fox licks the stump of Fox's tail and mends it with
text: gauze and medical tape. She looks furious. Kylie and the Fox
text: cubs watch, concerned. Ash says uncertainly:
speaker_heading: ASH
dialog: It'll grow back, won't it?
speaker_heading: KYLIE
dialog: (shaking his head)
text: Tails don't grow back, except for
text: lizards.
speaker_heading: FOX
speaker_heading: (MISERABLY)
dialog: Tails don't grow back. I'm going to be
dialog: tail-less for the rest of my life.
speaker_heading: ASH
speaker_heading: (NERVOUSLY)
dialog: Well, anyway, it's not half as bad as
dialog: double-pneumonia, right?
dialog: (pointing to Kristofferson)
text: His dad's got one foot in the grave and
text: one foot on a banana peel. That's a lot
dialog: worse than --
text: Kristofferson hurls an acorn violently onto the floor. It
text: ricochets off a wall and into a teacup. Everyone falls
text: silent. Kristofferson turns away.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: KRISTOFFERSON
dialog: Excuse me, everyone. I'm going to go
text: meditate for half an hour.
text: Kristofferson walks out of the room. Mrs. Fox looks at Ash
dialog: and says angrily:
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
dialog: You've got twenty-nine minutes to come up
dialog: with a proper apology.
text: Ash crosses his arms in front of his chest and stares
text: straight ahead into space grimly. Fox says suddenly:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: What's with the crazy outfit? Why a cape
dialog: and the pants tucked into your socks?
text: Ash does not respond. Fox sighs. Mrs. Fox finishes bandaging
text: his tail. Fox goes over to the wall and stands with his back
text: to the room.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: I got fired slash quit the Gazette and
text: started stealing chickens on the sly.
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
speaker_heading: (ICILY)
dialog: That tail was the first thing I ever
dialog: noticed about you. It was easily the most
text: attractive tail for at least 50 miles in
dialog: every direction. It was probably your
dialog: single best quality -- and now it's gone
dialog: forever.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Fox lying in bed staring at the ceiling in the dark next to

speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Why the cuss didn't I listen my lawyer?
dialog: At this point we'll be lucky if we can
dialog: flip this tree for half of what we've
text: already sunk into it.
text: Fox flips over onto his stomach.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: I won't be able to sleep on my back for
text: six weeks -- and on my stomach I feel
dialog: congested. Why the cuss didn't I listen
dialog: to my lawyer?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 36.
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
speaker_heading: (BITTERLY)
dialog: Because you don't listen to anybody.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: (sitting up suddenly)
dialog: What was that?
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: What? I said --
text: There is a quiet scraping sound from above. Fox jumps out of
text: bed. He hollers:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Wake up! Everybody! They're digging us
dialog: out!
text: There is a scrunch and then a loud thump from above. Mrs. Fox
text: looks at Fox intensely:
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
dialog: They'll kill the children!
speaker_heading: FOX
speaker_heading: (STEELY)
dialog: Over my dead body, they will.
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
speaker_heading: (ANGRILY)
dialog: That's what I'm saying! You'd be dead,
dialog: too, in that scenario!
speaker_heading: FOX
speaker_heading: (ANGRILY)
dialog: Well, I'm arguing against that!
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
speaker_heading: (SCREAMING)
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: FOX
speaker_heading: (SCREAMING)
dialog: Why are you yelling at me?
speaker_heading: KYLIE
speaker_heading: (AGONIZED)
dialog: Stop! Stop! Stop!
text: Fox and Mrs. Fox turn quickly to Kylie standing in the
text: doorway with a red blanket wrapped around his shoulders. Ash
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 37.
text: and Kristofferson stand behind him. They look terrified.
text: Kylie shouts in a pained voice:
speaker_heading: KYLIE
dialog: You say one thing, she says another, and
dialog: it all changes back again!
text: The point of a shovel pierces the ceiling. Everyone looks up
text: and stares in shock. Fox suddenly leaps across the room with
text: a wild energy, scrambles halfway up a wall, and throws over
text: two chairs.
speaker_heading: FOX
text: I've got it! There's not a moment to
dialog: lose! Why didn't I think of this before?
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
dialog: Think of what?
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Think of the one thing a fox does quicker
dialog: than a man, quicker than any other animal
dialog: in the world!
text: (at the top of his lungs)
dialog: DIG!!!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Everyone digging furiously. Dirt flies everywhere. The shot
text: booms down into the ground, among the roots of the tree,
text: through buried pebbles, layers of soil, and subterranean
dialog: mineral deposits.
speaker_heading: TITLE:
speaker_heading: 1 HOUR LATER
text: The shot stops at the bottom of a dark hole deep, deep
text: underground. Mrs. Fox lies on the floor, breathing heavily,
text: with a lit lantern at her side. The cubs are sprawled out
text: around her. Kylie leans in the corner with his shirt off tied
text: around his waist. Fox stands up and clears his throat.
text: Everyone looks at him.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: I think it's time for me to give us a pep
dialog: talk and explain some things.
dialog: (commencing a speech)
dialog: A very long time ago --
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
dialog: May I have a word with you privately?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: FOX
speaker_heading: (HESITATES)
dialog: Well, we're in a hole. Where --
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
dialog: Just on the other side of this mineral
dialog: deposit. Follow me.
text: Fox reluctantly follows Mrs. Fox through a crack in the
text: bedrock and into a small air-pocket with glittering quartz
text: walls. She wheels on Fox:
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
dialog: I'm going to lose my temper now.
speaker_heading: FOX
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: When?
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
dialog: Right now.
speaker_heading: FOX
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: Well, when --
text: Mrs. Fox scratches Fox across the face, slicing a quick
text: sliver into his fur. Fox cringes away with his paws up
text: protectively. He lowers his paws. His eyes fill with tears.
text: (NOTE: the scar in Fox's fur never grows back.)
text: Mrs. Fox takes a deep breath. She says:
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
dialog: Twelve fox-years ago, you made a promise
dialog: to me while we were caged inside that fox-
dialog: trap that, if we survived, you would
dialog: never steal another chicken, goose,
dialog: turkey, duck, or squab, whatever they
dialog: are. I believed you. Why did you lie to
dialog: me?
speaker_heading: FOX
speaker_heading: (SIMPLY)
dialog: Because I'm a wild animal.
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
dialog: You're also a husband and a father.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: FOX
speaker_heading: (PAINED)
dialog: I'm trying to tell you the truth about
dialog: myself.
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
dialog: I don't care about the truth about
dialog: yourself.
text: Fox looks down at the ground. He nods and tries to contain
text: his emotions. Mrs. Fox watches him coldly.
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
dialog: This story is too predictable.
speaker_heading: FOX
speaker_heading: (SURPRISED)
dialog: Predictable? Really? What happens in the
dialog: end?
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
speaker_heading: (QUIETLY)
dialog: In the end, we all die -- unless you
dialog: change.
text: Mrs. Fox walks out of the air-pocket. Fox stands alone in
dialog: silence.
scene_heading: EXT. FOX'S TREE. DAY
text: The next morning. There is a large hole in the side of the
text: hill, under Fox's tree. The ceiling to the living room has
text: been completely removed. Boggis, Bunce, and Bean stand half-
text: underground with their heads sticking out of the hole,
text: breathing hard, with dirty shovels over their shoulders.
text: Bunce stands on Fox's tiny club chair.
speaker_heading: BUNCE
text: These foxes dig like a bunch of
text: hyperactive gophers.
speaker_heading: BOGGIS
dialog: Franklin? You got another twist for this
dialog: plot?
speaker_heading: BEAN
dialog: Say that again?
speaker_heading: BOGGIS
dialog: I say you got another --
text: Bean whips out his walkie-talkie and twirls it like a six-
text: shooter. He presses a button on it and says:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: BEAN

speaker_heading: BEAN
speaker_heading: (INNOCENTLY)
dialog: What? You mean over at Malloy
dialog: Consolidated? Oh, he does rentals.
speaker_heading: BOGGIS
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: What does he rent?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Three yellow and black, murderous, brutal bulldozer digging-
text: tractors with Malloy Consolidated painted on the sides of
text: them. They make a terrible, high-pitched growling noise and
text: spit black grease and smoke.
text: Boggis, Bunce, and Bean stand among the tractors nodding
text: giddily to each other. They scramble into the drivers' seats
text: and begin ripping into the hillside. Bunce sits on a
text: dictionary to see over the dashboard.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Fox, Mrs. Fox, Kylie, Ash, and Kristofferson digging
text: frantically.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: The tractors grabbing huge chunks of earth and tossing them
text: into the meadow. Boggis, Bunce, and Bean, drunk with digging,
text: laugh manically as the controls of their tractors.
speaker_heading: BEAN
dialog: Let's kick some fox cuss!
speaker_heading: BUNCE
dialog: I'm cussing loving this!
speaker_heading: BOGGIS
text: Who's hyper-cussing-active now?
text: Bean throws his tractor into top gear. The teeth of the giant

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: A grizzled, white-haired man in a greasy yellow and black

scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:

scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:

scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: The tractors almost completely below ground in a deep crater.
text: A crowd of neighbors and local press from the town has
text: gathered and watches as the tractors stop digging and rumble
text: up out of the crater. The motors go quiet. Boggis, Bunce, and

text: tired. They stand among the workers and onlookers.
text: A television reporter with an Action 13 camera crew confronts
speaker_heading: BEAN:
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: Farmer, correct me if I'm misreading the
dialog: data, you've successfully destroyed the

dialog: large. What will you three prominent
dialog: farmers do now?
speaker_heading: BEAN
dialog: Well, Dan, I can tell you what we're not
dialog: going to do. We're not going to let him

speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: Are you concerned about the possibility
dialog: OF --
speaker_heading: BEAN
dialog: I have no further dialogue in this scene.
text: Bean turns away from the reporter and pulls Boggis and Bunce
text: aside. He addresses them with calm intensity:
speaker_heading: BEAN
dialog: I'm not going home until we smoke this
dialog: son-of-a-cuss out his hole, string him up
text: on a clothesline, and fly him like a
dialog: kite. Boggis, how many men have you got

speaker_heading: BEAN
dialog: Bunce?
speaker_heading: BUNCE
text: Thirty-six.
speaker_heading: BEAN
dialog: And I've got thirty-seven. That's 108 men

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: That night. A helicopter with a Bean, inc. decal on the side

scene_heading: INT. HOLE. NIGHT
text: Fox, his family, and Kylie lie exhausted on the floor of

scene_heading: EXT. CAMP. NIGHT

text: One of them cooks a chicken on a spit. Another sits on a log
text: playing a banjo. He is Petey. He sings:
speaker_heading: PETEY
dialog: 'Bout a handsome little fox
dialog: Let me sing you folks a yarn.
text: Hey, diddle-dee, doddle-do, doodle-dum!
dialog: 'Twas a splendid little feller
dialog: Full of wit 'n' grace 'n' charm.
text: Say, zippy-zee, yappy-yo, google-gum!
text: The shot moves past the leathery faces of the other farmhands
text: as they listen: amused, moved, hungry, tired, charmed,
text: annoyed, whistling, playing a jew's harp, trying to sing
text: along but not really knowing the words, etc.
speaker_heading: PETEY

speaker_heading: PETEY
dialog: I don't know. I was just kind of making

speaker_heading: ASH
dialog: What's that?
text: Ash points. Everyone looks. A tiny hole appears in the wall
text: at the end of the tunnel. Dirt crumbles out of it -- and a

speaker_heading: ASH STARTS:
speaker_heading: ASH
dialog: Dad?
speaker_heading: FOX
scene_heading: (WHISPERS SHARPLY)
dialog: Not a sound!

text: stands in front of Fox with his law partner Beaver, Beaver's
text: overgrown, hulking son, a medium-sized mole, and a grey field
text: mouse with a bandana tied in a "do-rag" style around his
text: head. Badger has a spoon in his hand. Fox and Badger erupt at

speaker_heading: BADGER

speaker_heading: BADGER
dialog: We're all cussing starving to death

text: Fox and Badger snarl and scratch at each other, circling

speaker_heading: BADGER
dialog: We've been digging in circles for three

dialog: Nobody can get out. Right now my wife's
text: huddled at the bottom of the flint-mine

speaker_heading: BEAVER'S SON
dialog: We don't like you, and we hate your dad.

speaker_heading: ASH
dialog: (scared and disgusted)
dialog: I'm not going to eat mud!
speaker_heading: BEAVER'S SON
dialog: Cuss, yeah, you are.
text: Beaver's son grabs a handful of mud, smashes it into Ash's
text: mouth, and forces his jaws up and down in a chewing motion.
text: Ash coughs and splutters. Kristofferson frowns. He takes off
text: his shoes with his feet. He says with a quiet ferocity:
speaker_heading: KRISTOFFERSON
dialog: Don't do that.

speaker_heading: BEAVER'S SON

text: This is getting a little too personal.
text: Badger waits for Fox to continue. Fox stares into space.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Give me a minute.
text: Fox turns and walks away. He faces the wall of the tunnel. He
text: sits down on a rock. Everyone watches him uncertainly. They
text: look at each other. Badger starts to say something, but Kylie
text: cuts him off sharply:
speaker_heading: KYLIE
speaker_heading: (SHARPLY)
dialog: Shh!
text: Badger falls silent. Fox sits with his chin on his paw, lost
text: in concentrated thought. He stands up. He nods repeatedly and
text: begins to pace. His eyes dart from one spot to another. His
text: paws move abruptly around in the air drawing lines and
text: shapes. He freezes and looks straight up at the ceiling of
text: the tunnel. He snaps the fingers of his paw and looks to the
text: others. He says with a cautious excitement:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: I've got an idea.
speaker_heading: BADGER
speaker_heading: (TENTATIVELY)
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: It could be a good one.
speaker_heading: BEAVER
speaker_heading: (POINTEDLY)
dialog: Lay it on us.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: It might save our lives.
speaker_heading: KYLIE
speaker_heading: (EXASPERATED)
dialog: Say the idea!
text: Fox looks down at Ash, who stands beside him with mud still
text: on his mouth. He nods. He says suddenly:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: All right! Let's try it!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 49.
text: Fox runs over to Mrs. Fox:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Go to the flint-mine. Tell Mrs. Badger,
text: Rabbit's ex-girlfriend, et al. that help
text: is on the way.
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
speaker_heading: (SKEPTICALLY)
dialog: Is help on the way?
text: Fox grips Mrs. Fox's paw. He looks into her eyes and says
scene_heading: INTENSELY:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: I sure as cuss hope so.
text: Mrs. Fox detects a special, familiar, inspired light in her
text: husband's eyes at this moment. She nods. She hands Ash the
text: lantern. She straightens the neck-line of his cape, licks the
text: mud off Ash's snout, and scrambles away down Badger's tunnel.
text: Ash wants to cry but does not. Fox turns to the others.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Gentlemen, this time we must dig in a
dialog: very special direction.
text: Fox feels the walls with his paws. Everyone watches
text: attentively.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: I got to kind of feel out the vibe.
text: Fox stops. He points slightly downwards and due south. He
text: says with quiet anticipation:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Begin.
text: Everyone starts digging, slowly but intently.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: The diggers one hundred yards later. Fox suddenly whistles
text: and raises his fist.
text: The diggers stop digging. Fox feels the ceiling with his
text: paws. He knocks something hard. It sounds hollow. He looks at
text: the others with a funny expression and raises an eyebrow.
text: Fox carefully pushes up a floorboard. It creaks loudly. They
text: all duck down and wait. Nothing happens. Fox pushes up a
text: second floorboard. He cautiously pokes his head up through
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 50.
text: the gap. He lets out a shriek of excitement and whispers
text: excitedly down to the others:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: I've done it! I've done it, first time!
dialog: Come up and see where you are, my
dialog: darlings!
text: Everyone scrambles up out of the tunnel.
scene_heading: INT. SHED. NIGHT
text: Everyone stands in the middle of Boggis' Chicken House #1.
text: The room is teeming with chickens, which stare at them
text: nervously. There are black chickens, white chickens, brown
text: chickens, and one that combines all three colors. Fox
speaker_heading: WHISPERS:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: I hit it slap in the middle! Do you get
dialog: how incredible this is?
text: The others nod. They look dazed and wild. Fox holds up his
text: hands and whispers:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Don't lose your heads, now. Let's do this
dialog: properly. First, everyone have a drink of
dialog: water.
text: Fox leads the others over to the chickens' drinking trough.
text: They all lap up the cool water. Fox dries his mouth.
speaker_heading: FOX
speaker_heading: SECOND --
text: Fox seizes a black chicken violently.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Ash and Kristofferson running down the tunnel carrying two
text: dead, black chickens. They turn three corners and arrive at
text: the mossy hollow. They look inside.
speaker_heading: MONTAGE:
text: Fox and the other diggers tunnel under the silo in front of
text: Bunce Industries. Cows eat grass in the pasture above.
text: Fox and the other diggers comes out of a hole in the floor
text: and dance an ecstatic jig in a great storeroom lined to the
text: ceiling with plucked ducks and geese. Smoked hams and sides
text: of bacon dangle from the rafters.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 51.
text: Fox and the other diggers tunnel under the windmill in front
text: of Bean, inc. Sheep eat clover in the field above.
text: Fox and the other diggers comes out of a hole in the floor
text: and dance an ecstatic jig in a corrugated plastic and metal
text: pen among dozens of gobbling turkeys.
text: Fox and the other diggers race dancing ecstatically back
text: through the complex network of tunnels carrying dead turkeys,
text: geese, bacon, flour, salt, sugar, jars of cider, and a
text: portable television set.
scene_heading: INT. FLINT-MINE. DAY
text: The flint-mine is a large but cozy space with stone walls, a
text: dirt floor, a small kitchen, and a fireplace. There are rows
text: of cots, sleeping bags, boxes, blankets, and suitcases for
text: all the refugee animals. All the animals have gathered
text: together and drink cider cocktails while small rabbits,
text: skunks, and field mice set the table. The room is festooned
text: with garlands. A well-dressed mole smoking a pipe plays the
text: piano. A bespectacled rabbit leans against it humming a tune.
text: Weasel stands in the corner talking with Beaver.
speaker_heading: WEASEL
dialog: What am I going to do? I'm going to hold
dialog: him to the terms of the contract. It's
dialog: not my fault they uprooted it.
text: Kristofferson serves cranberry punch from a tureen in the
text: corner. Ash goes over to him and holds out a mug.
speaker_heading: ASH
dialog: They say I owe you an apology for some of
dialog: the mean things I said about your
dialog: father's illness. His double-pneumonia or
dialog: whatever they're calling it now.
text: Kristofferson ladles Ash a cupful.
speaker_heading: KRISTOFFERSON
dialog: OK.
speaker_heading: ASH
dialog: So there it is. I hope we can continue
dialog: our relationship as cousins or family
dialog: members or however you want to define
dialog: IT --
dialog: (suddenly more intense)
dialog: -- but do me a favor for yourself. The
dialog: next time you have a problem with

speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: ASH (CONT'D)
dialog: and let's deal with it right then and not
text: let it blow up into a whole, huge thing
dialog: involving parents and so on. Agreed?
text: Ash drinks his punch in one long sip and holds out the empty
text: mug for a refill. Kristofferson nods slowly. He points at Ash
text: with his ladle.
speaker_heading: KRISTOFFERSON
dialog: I'm going to teach you karate.
text: Badger sits next to the fireplace with Fox and Kylie.
speaker_heading: BADGER
dialog: I can imagine how painful, even just
dialog: emotionally, that must be for you.
speaker_heading: FOX
speaker_heading: (UNEASY)
dialog: Well, you know, it's not the end of the
dialog: world.
speaker_heading: BADGER
speaker_heading: (MORE ANIMATED)
dialog: Oh, but, Foxy, how humiliating! Having
dialog: your whole tail blown clean off by a --
speaker_heading: FOX
speaker_heading: (COOLY)
dialog: Can we drop it?
text: Kristofferson starts to refill Ash's mug again. Ash suddenly
text: puts his paw over the brim. Kristofferson hesitates. Ash
text: raises an eyebrow and says mysterriously:
speaker_heading: ASH
dialog: Ever tasted one of Mrs. Bean's famous
dialog: nutmeg-ginger-apple snaps?
scene_heading: EXT. CAMP. DAY
text: A large fire truck drives up to the destroyed hill with
text: firemen hanging off the back and sides. It parks among the
text: tractors and tents. The chief, in a white helmet, goes over
text: to Boggis, Bunce, and Bean waiting at the mouth of the pit. A
text: patch on his sleeve says O.W.F.R.P.F. Farmhands and firemen
text: circle around.
speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: Who's got me a donation for the old
dialog: Wounded Fireman's Retirement Pension
dialog: Fund?
text: Bean pulls a yellow check out of his inside pocket.
dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: BEAN
dialog: Right here.
text: (pointing behind him)
dialog: Let me show you this hole.
scene_heading: INT. FLINT-MINE. DAY
text: Candles glow all around. Everyone is seated at the long
text: dining room table, and a magnificent feast with every variety
text: of fruit, meat, vegetable, and roasted bird has been laid out
text: in front of them. They tear into their meals, eating and
text: drinking ferociously. Crumbs, juices, blood, and bones fly
text: into the air. Jaws snap and chew. There is no conversation.
text: Badger suddenly stands and rings a knife against his cider
text: glass. Everyone looks up, taking a breather from the frenzy
text: of eating. Badger clears his throat.
speaker_heading: BADGER
dialog: Well, it took a near-catastrophe for all
dialog: of you to finally take me up on my offer
dialog: to have you over to the flint-mine for
dialog: dinner, but I guess we have --
speaker_heading: FOX
speaker_heading: (INTERRUPTING)
dialog: I'm sorry. Maybe my invitation got lost
dialog: in the mail. Does anybody know what this
dialog: badger's talking about?
text: Everyone laughs. Fox sits at the opposite end of the table
text: with a crooked smile on his face.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: But Clive's right --
scene_heading: (STANDING UP)
dialog: -- in all seriousness --
dialog: (aside, to Badger)
dialog: -- excuse me, B.
text: Fox raises his cider glass. Badger reluctantly sits back
dialog: down.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: I guess we do have those three ugly,
dialog: cusshole farmers to thank for one thing:
dialog: reminding us to be thankful and aware of
dialog: each other. I'm going to say it again.
scene_heading: (GESTURING EXPANSIVELY)
dialog: Aware.
text: Badger whispers to his wife:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: BADGER
dialog: Foxy cuss-blocked my toast, man.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: The hole where Fox's tree once stood. The dead tree lies on
text: its side. A fireman slides a thick hose deep into the tunnel.
text: He looks behind him and nods.
speaker_heading: FIREMAN #1
dialog: Ready.
text: The shot moves backwards along the hose, past seven more
text: firemen signalling to each other with: a thumbs-up, a snap, a
text: fist in the air, a swirl of the fingers, a peace symbol, an A-
text: OK, and a hook-'em Horns. The shot continues past Boggis,
text: Bunce, and Bean helping to hold the hose in position. Boggis
text: growls. Bunce hisses. Bean snarls. The shot arrives at a pump
text: on the side of the fire truck. The chief points:
speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: Let her rip.
text: A fireman cranks a huge wrench on a steel nut. A pressure
text: gauge shoots to maximum. The fire truck and hose begin to
text: vibrate loudly.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Ash and Kristofferson crouched under a drain-cover pushed
text: just-open next to a refrigerator. They peer out across a
text: bright, clean, white kitchen at a plate of perfect, golden
text: cookies on a counter-top next to an open window with a step-
text: ladder directly in front of it. They look at each other. They
text: look around the quiet, empty room. Ash shrugs.
text: Ash and Kristofferson dart out, leaving the drain-cover
text: propped-up. They race over the linoleum. They climb the step-
text: ladder and stop at the plate. Ash swoons and says
scene_heading: RAPTUROUSLY:
speaker_heading: ASH
text: They're still warm.
text: Ash and Kristofferson gather more cookies than they can
text: possibly carry, eating as they collect them. Crumbs go
dialog: everywhere.
text: On the other side of the room, the drain-cover falls shut
text: with a loud clank. Ash and Kristofferson look up, wildly
text: startled. All at once they hear in a simultaneous cacophony:
text: the back door bursting open, a boy and two beagles shouting
text: and barking, the pantry door slamming, Mrs. Bean and her
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 55.
text: middle-aged housekeeper clanging pots and pans and arguing, a
text: timer on the counter-top ringing, and a raven fluttering to
text: the windowsill and cawing.
text: Ash and Kristofferson panic silently. They drop the cookies
text: and fly down the step-ladder.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Fox in mid-toast:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: I've stepped on some toes and alienated a
dialog: few of you over the past few days -- but
dialog: is it wrong for me to suggest we might've
dialog: done worse than having an incredible
text: banquet in a beautiful flint-mine
dialog: surrounded by our favorite animals? Look
dialog: at each other. Here we are. Wow. Now I've
dialog: already had too much to drink, and I'm
dialog: feeling sentimental, but I'm going to say
dialog: something, anyway, which nobody wants to
dialog: admit, but I think is probably true: we
dialog: beat 'em. We beat those farmers, and now
text: we're triumphantly eating their roasted
text: chicken, their sizzling duck, their
dialog: succulent turkey, their foie gras de --
speaker_heading: (SUDDENLY)
dialog: Where'd the boys go? Ash? Kristofferson?
dialog: (to Mrs. Fox)
dialog: What am I hearing again, baby? What's
dialog: happening? Am I still paranoid?
text: There is a low, distant rumbling which rapidly builds to a
text: deafening roar. Everyone waits, frozen. A single drop of
text: water drips from the ceiling into Badger's water glass. Fox
text: turns to Badger and says:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Let's pause again.
text: A wild deluge smashes into the room flooding the flint-mine
text: and tunnels with a blasting current that sweeps everyone and
text: everything away chaotically.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: The entire party of well-dressed animals and their plates,
text: furniture, chickens, etc. shooting down the tunnel with the
text: rushing waters. Fox, helpless, holding his breath, looks to
text: the others underwater: Badger shakes his head in disgust;
text: Rabbit makes a fierce grimace; Mole bares his teeth
text: ferociously; Beaver rants angrily with bubbles coming out off
text: his mouth; and Kylie stares ahead vacantly, holding his nose.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 56.
text: Fox turns sadly to Mrs. Fox. She looks terrified.
scene_heading: INT. SEWER SYSTEM. NIGHT
text: The flood blasts out of a wide pipe rocketing the animals
text: into a murky, brick cavern with drainpipes on all sides and
text: three inches of black water on its floor. Fox picks himself
text: up, dazed and scared, and looks around at his soaked friends
dialog: and their families.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: What the cuss just happened? Something
dialog: with water. That was dangerous. Is anyone
dialog: hurt?
speaker_heading: BADGER
speaker_heading: (FURIOUS )
dialog: We're all hurt! My entire flint-mine just
dialog: got demolished!
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Let's do a head-count! Everybody pick a
dialog: buddy!
text: Each animal turns to his neighbor and establishes their buddy
text: relationship. Fox looks wildly agitated as his eyes dart
text: about, searching. He shouts:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Where'd the boys go? Ash? Kristofferson?
text: Ash's voice cracks on the other side of the cavern:
speaker_heading: ASH
dialog: I'm here.
text: Everyone turns to see Ash standing at the mouth of a smaller
text: pipe. He looks devastated and terrified. Fox points to him.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Ash! Who's your buddy?
speaker_heading: ASH
dialog: Kristofferson, but I lost him.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: You lost him? Where were you?
speaker_heading: ASH
dialog: We went for cookies.
text: Everyone turns to Fox. Fox yells desperately:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Kristofferson!
text: Fox sprints around the cavern, splashing, digging, and
text: ducking in and out of tunnels as the others join his frantic
text: search. His voice sounds pained as he shouts:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Kristofferson! Kristofferson!
dialog: Kristofferson!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: The three farmers standing next to the fire truck. Bean holds
text: a soaked, half-conscious Kristofferson up in the air by the
text: tail. Kristofferson is quietly crying.
speaker_heading: BEAN
text: Wrap this wet, little mutt in a newspaper
dialog: and put him in a box with some holes
text: punched in the top.
scene_heading: INT. SEWER SYSTEM. NIGHT
text: Everyone has gathered together. They are all in a state of
text: shock. Fox turns to Mrs. Fox beside him.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Your brother's going to kill me, if he
text: survives his double-pneumonia.
text: Beaver runs into the brick cavern out of a drainpipe,
scene_heading: SHOUTING:
speaker_heading: BEAVER
dialog: There's only one way out of this sewer,
text: but the manhole cover's closed, and
text: there's a station-wagon parked on it --
dialog: which means we're permanently stuck down
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: BADGER
speaker_heading: (BITTERLY)
dialog: You still think we beat 'em, Foxy?
text: Everyone turns to Fox and stares at him coldly. Fox sits down
text: on the floor, in the water. He says quietly:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Somebody take over. I'm not in charge
dialog: anymore.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 58.
text: Everyone looks around at each other. They don't know what to
text: do. Mrs. Fox sits down in the water next to Fox.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: You told me to change, but I can't --
speaker_heading: (REALIZING)
dialog: -- except, possibly, on some level, I
dialog: think I just did.
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: Well, then maybe we're not all going to
dialog: die.
text: Fox looks to Mrs. Fox. He stands up suddenly. He takes Mrs.
text: Fox's hand.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Excuse us, everyone.
text: Fox leads Mrs. Fox over to a ledge near a cement waterfall on
text: the far side of the brick cavern. He puts his arm around her
dialog: waist.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Badger's right. These farmers aren't
dialog: going to quit until they catch me. I
dialog: shouldn't have lied to your face. I
dialog: shouldn't have resigned slash gotten
dialog: fired from the Gazette. I shouldn't have
dialog: pushed these farmers so far and tried to
text: embarrass them and cuss with their heads.
dialog: I enjoyed it, but I shouldn't have done
text: it -- and now there's only one way out.
dialog: Maybe if I hand myself over and let them
dialog: kill me, stuff me, and hang me over their
scene_heading: MANTELPIECE --
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
speaker_heading: (ICILY)
dialog: You'll do no such thing.
speaker_heading: FOX
speaker_heading: (QUIETLY)
dialog: Darling, maybe they'll let everyone else
dialog: live.
text: Mrs. Fox stares at Fox. She says desolately:
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
dialog: Why'd you have to get us into this, Foxy?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: I don't know, but I have a possible
dialog: theory. I think I have this thing where I
dialog: need everybody to think I'm the greatest
dialog: -- the quote-unquote fantastic Mr. Fox --
dialog: and if they aren't completely knocked-
text: out, dazzled, and kind of intimidated by
dialog: me, then I don't feel good about myself.
text: Mrs. Fox shakes her head and turns away. Fox continues:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Foxes traditionally like to court danger,
dialog: hunt prey, and outsmart predators -- and
dialog: that's what I'm actually good at! I
dialog: think, at the end of the day, I'm just --
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
speaker_heading: (QUIETLY)
dialog: We're wild animals.
text: Fox smiles sadly and nods. He shrugs.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: I guess we always were. I promise you: if
dialog: I had all this to do over again, I'd have
dialog: never let you down. It was always more
dialog: fun when we did it together, anyway.
text: Mrs. Fox has tears all over her face. Fox kisses her. He
text: whispers in her ear:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: I love you, Felicity.
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
dialog: I love you, too, but I shouldn't have
dialog: married you.
text: Mrs. Fox turns and walks away. Fox stares after her. He goes
text: over to Ash.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Did I ever tell you about the time I
dialog: learned we were going to have a cub?
speaker_heading: ASH
text: In the fox-trap.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Right. We were at gun-point, and your
scene_heading: MOTHER --
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: ASH
text: -- says she's pregnant.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Let me tell it, OK? I had no idea how we
dialog: were going to get out of this jam, and
dialog: then it hit me: what do foxes do better
dialog: than any other animal?
speaker_heading: ASH
dialog: Dig.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: You're stepping on my lines.
speaker_heading: ASH
dialog: Keep telling it.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: So we dug. And the whole time I put paw
text: over paw, scooping dirt and pebbles with
dialog: your mother digging like crazy beside me,
dialog: I kept wondering: who is this little boy
dialog: going to be?
speaker_heading: ASH
dialog: Or girl.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Or girl, right -- because at that point
dialog: we didn't know.
text: Fox grabs Ash by his shoulders and looks him in the eye.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Ash, I'm so glad he was you.
text: Fox hugs Ash tightly, holds him for an instant, then let's
text: go. He turns to the group.
speaker_heading: FOX
text: Badger, organize a search party and try
text: to find Kristofferson. Maybe he's alive.
dialog: I'm sorry, everyone. I wish --
speaker_heading: (HESITATES)
dialog: Well, good-bye.
text: Fox looks across the cavern to Mrs. Fox standing with her
text: back to him. She turns to face him. Her eyes are burning. Fox
text: smiles sadly. He races away down the drain-pipe. Everyone
text: watches him disappear. Badger hesitates. He addresses the
scene_heading: GROUP UNCERTAINLY:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: BADGER
dialog: I guess we should probably split into a
dialog: certain number of groups and start doing
dialog: something, right?
scene_heading: INT. CONDUIT. NIGHT
text: Fox sprints full-speed in the darkness. His claws scratch
text: rattling along the iron floor and splash through puddles of
text: shallow water.
text: Fox stops suddenly. He stands up tall on his hind legs. His
text: ears perk up. One pins back. He listens.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Badger carrying a lantern leading Ash, Mole, and two small
text: rabbits down a drainpipe. Badger calls out:
speaker_heading: BADGER
dialog: Kristofferson? Hello? Can you hear us?
text: Rat's voice echoes in the darkness:
speaker_heading: RAT
dialog: Y'all lookin' for somethin'? Nothin' down
text: here but rusty bottle-caps and drainin'
dialog: water.
text: Everyone stops short. Rat drops into the pipe from an
text: overhead drain ahead of them. He says ominously:
speaker_heading: RAT
dialog: They got the boy.
speaker_heading: BADGER
speaker_heading: (FROZEN)
dialog: Who's got him?
speaker_heading: RAT
dialog: The farmers three. You know who I'm
dialog: talkin' about.
speaker_heading: BADGER
speaker_heading: (HESITATES)
dialog: They've kidnapped him?
speaker_heading: RAT
dialog: Well-done, Mr. Badger. You're a smart
dialog: man. They want to trade the son for his
dialog: poppa.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 62.
text: Rat flicks a folded letter through the air. Badger catches
text: it. He opens it. Kylie looks over his shoulder. Badger
text: frowns.
speaker_heading: BADGER
dialog: Why'd they write this in letters cut out
dialog: of magazines?
speaker_heading: KYLIE
dialog: To protect their identities.
dialog: (on second thought)
dialog: Oh, right, but then why'd they sign their
dialog: names? Plus, we already knew who they
dialog: were because they're trying to kill us.
speaker_heading: INSERT:
text: A ransom note written in letters cut out of magazines and
text: pasted onto a piece of paper. Badger reads out loud:
dialog: Mr. Fox, we have your son. If you
dialog: ever want to see him alive again --
text: Ash calls out:
speaker_heading: ASH
dialog: I'm his son.
text: Everyone looks at Ash. He stands behind them in silhouette.
text: Rat says darkly:
speaker_heading: RAT
text: I can see the resemblance.
text: Pause. In an instant, Rat grabs Ash by the tail, picks him up
text: off the ground, swings him in the air, and flings him away
text: twenty feet down the drainpipe. Badger looks stunned.
text: Ash sits in a puddle in a stupor. Rat races toward him down
text: the tunnel. He leaps into the air with his claws out and his
text: teeth bared. As he is about to seize upon Ash -- he is
text: suddenly jerked backwards and spun around.
text: Rat is face to face with Fox. Fox strikes his old-fashioned
text: boxing stance. He draws back and throws a hard punch, nailing
text: Rat square in the jaw. Rat staggers, stunned. He swings his
text: switchblade, cutting Fox across the chest.
text: Fox touches the wound and looks at the blood on the fingers
text: of his paw. He looks to Rat. Rat holds up his wrist and shows
text: Fox a child's plastic digital watch with miniature footballs,
text: baseballs, and soccer balls on it. He says strangely:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: RAT
dialog: I've still got it.
speaker_heading: FOX
speaker_heading: (FROWNING)
dialog: What'd you just say?
speaker_heading: RAT
dialog: I said I've still got the watch, Mr. Fox.
dialog: She never asked for it back.
text: A frozen moment. Fox springs forward and clamps his jaws onto
text: Rat's throat. Rat tumbles over backwards. Fox pins him to the
text: ground with his teeth in Rat's neck. Rat kicks and bucks and
text: struggles, but Fox holds him fast. Rat goes limp. Fox
text: releases him.
text: Everyone slowly gathers around Fox and Rat. Ash kneels next
text: to his father. Fox cradles Rat in his arms. Rat whispers:
speaker_heading: RAT
text: The boy's locked in an apple crate on top
text: of a gun-locker in the attic of Bean

dialog: Would you have told me if I didn't kill

text: Rat smiles sickly. Blood drips from his mouth. His voice
speaker_heading: CREAKS:
speaker_heading: RAT
dialog: Never.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: (shaking his head)
dialog: All these wasted years. What were you
dialog: looking for, Rat?
text: Fox wipes the blood from Rat's chin. Rat mutters.
speaker_heading: ASH
dialog: He's trying to say something, Dad.
text: Fox leans his ear close to Rat's mouth. As quiet as a mouse,
scene_heading: RAT WHISPERS:
speaker_heading: RAT
dialog: Cider.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 64.
text: Fox nods. He looks around the drainpipe. He cups his paw into
text: the pool of murky water and holds it to Rat's lips.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Here you are, Rat. A beaker of Bean's
dialog: finest secret cider.
text: Rat's slivery, scratchity, long, pink tongue laps up a taste
text: of the black liquid. He licks his lips and says faintly:
speaker_heading: RAT
text: Like melted gold.
text: Rat's eyes turn into X's. He is dead. Ash stands up.
speaker_heading: ASH
dialog: He redeemed himself.
speaker_heading: FOX
speaker_heading: (SHRUGS)
dialog: Redemption? Sure.
text: Fox swallows and says hopelessly with tears in his eyes:
speaker_heading: FOX
text: But, in the end -- he's just another dead
text: rat in a garbage pail behind a Chinese
dialog: restaurant.
text: Ash puts his hand on Fox's shoulder. Fox lays Rat gently onto
text: the sewer floor. He stands up and turns to the rest of the
text: group. Badger claps his paws together.
speaker_heading: BADGER
dialog: Well, I suppose we should --
speaker_heading: FOX
speaker_heading: (INTERRUPTING)
dialog: Excuse me, again, B. The search party's
dialog: been cancelled. We're replacing it with a

speaker_heading: (YELLING)
dialog: Now, go!
text: The two little rabbits scurry away down the drainpipe. Badger
text: walks with Fox and Ash.
speaker_heading: BADGER
dialog: What was he saying about that wristwatch?
dialog: I didn't get what he was talking about.
dialog: 
dialog:

dialog:

text: Fox hesitates. He shrugs and says with a sad nostalgia:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Just some old back-story.
scene_heading: INT. SEWER SYSTEM. NIGHT
text: The entire community of animals has reconnoitered in the
text: brick cavern. Fox stands on a large spigot and addresses the
text: group. He has a bandage on his chest.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: In a way, I'm almost glad that flood
dialog: interrupted us, because I don't like the
dialog: toast I was giving. I'm going to start
dialog: over.
text: Fox pantomimes raising a long-stemmed glass.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: When I look down this table with the
text: exquisite feast set before us, I see: two
dialog: terrific lawyers, a skilled pediatrician,
dialog: a wonderful chef, a savvy real-estate
dialog: agent, an excellent tailor, a crack
text: accountant, a gifted musician, a pretty
dialog: good minnow fisherman, and possibly the
dialog: best landscape painter working on the
dialog: scene today.
text: As Fox describes them, the shot cuts to: Badger and Beaver;
text: Mrs. Badger; Rabbit; Weasel; an especially small, waifish
text: field mouse; Mole; Kylie (who looks slightly offended); and
text: Mrs. Fox, respectively.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Maybe a few of you might even read my
dialog: column from time to time. Who knows? I
dialog: tend to doubt it.
speaker_heading: (DRAMATIC PAUSE)
text: I also see a room full of wild animals.
text: Everyone stares at Fox curiously, skeptical but intrigued.
text: Fox points at them:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Wild animals with true natures and pure
dialog: talents. Wild animals with scientific-
dialog: sounding Latin names that mean something
dialog: about our D.N.A. Wild animals each with
dialog: his own strengths and weaknesses due to

dialog: It's just a thought. Thank you for

text: Fox motions with his imaginary glass and pantomimes drinking
text: it. A few of the others reluctantly pantomime drinking. Fox
text: finishes his glass and pantomimes throwing it on the floor.
text: He makes a smashing-glass sound. Kylie shouts:
speaker_heading: KYLIE

text: Everyone turns to Kylie uncertainly. Kylie hesitates.
speaker_heading: KYLIE
dialog: What? I'm just playing along with the --
speaker_heading: FOX
speaker_heading: (FORCEFULLY)
dialog: All right! Let's start planning! Who

text: Pause. Badger points to his otter secretary. She is Linda.
text: Fox darts over to her and grips her by the arm.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Linda! Lutra Lutra! You got some dry
dialog: paper? Here we go!
text: Fox, highly energized, moves among the group, touching their

speaker_heading: FOX

speaker_heading: MOLE
speaker_heading: (HESITATES)

speaker_heading: WEASEL

speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: All right!
text: Fox points to the various cubs and pups.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: All you little kids get organized and put

dialog: something to keep this sewer clean. It's
dialog: good for morale.

text: makes a fist with his paw.
speaker_heading: FIELD MOUSE
dialog: I want to go with you, too! I want to

speaker_heading: FOX
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: Good. Fabulous! Microtus Pennsylvanicus!
dialog: Do you do that, in fact? Are field mice

speaker_heading: FIELD MOUSE
dialog: Not particularly, except maybe domestic/

dialog: hunch I might just --
scene_heading: (DEVIL-MAY-CARE)
dialog: -- land a few good punches before I get
dialog: stepped on, poisoned, or lured to my

speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: (smiling with admiration)
dialog: You're a cuss of a lot bigger than you
dialog: look, Rickity.
text: Kylie tugs at Fox's sleeve. Fox turns to look at him. Kylie
scene_heading: SAYS SHYLY:
speaker_heading: KYLIE
dialog: I didn't get a job yet -- or a Latin
dialog: name. What's my strength?
text: Fox raises an eyebrow. He thinks of something:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Listen, you're Kylie. You're an
dialog: unbelievably nice guy. Your job is really
dialog: just to... be available, I think. I don't
dialog: know your Latin name. I doubt they even
dialog: had opossums in ancient Rome.
text: Kylie puts his hands in his pockets and scowls.
scene_heading: INT. SEWER SYSTEM. NIGHT
text: Mrs. Fox puts the finishing touches on a vast mural painted
text: on the longest, tallest wall of the brick cavern. She stands
text: on a ladder. Her sleeves are rolled up, and she is splattered
text: with twelve different colors of paint. She looks down to Fox
text: standing below with an entourage of Kylie, Badger, Linda, and
text: Rickity. The animal children mop and scrub in the background.
text: Ash stands leaning against a push-broom watching his parents.
text: Fox surveys the mural. It is highly detailed, filled with the
text: textures of the landscape, and decorated with images of
text: flowers, leaves, acorns, etc. It is signed Felicity Fox. Fox
text: opens his arms wide and shouts:
speaker_heading: FOX
text: It's stupendous. Where's us?
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
dialog: (pointing to a spot)
dialog: Right here.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Paint an X.
speaker_heading: INSERT:
text: The bottom of the map. Mrs. Fox's paw paints a red X and puts
text: a circle around it.
text: The shot zooms out to reveal the entire valley -- no longer a
text: painting on the brick wall. Lighting strikes at the horizon.
text: Dark clouds loom over the three farmers' compounds. It looks
text: exactly like one of Mrs. Fox's paintings of a landscape in a
text: rainstorm. Bean's helicopter circles the area.
scene_heading: EXT. HILL. NIGHT
text: A bicycle messenger with a head-lamp rings his bell as he
text: approaches the farmers' camp. He stops in front of Bean and
text: hands him an envelope. Bean tears it open and unfolds the
text: letter inside.
speaker_heading: INSERT:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 70.
text: A note written in letters cut out of magazines and pasted
text: onto a piece of paper. It reads:
dialog: Dear Farmers Boggis, Bunce, and Bean,
dialog: I have no alternative but to agree to
dialog: your terms. Move the station wagon and
text: open the manhole cover below the foot of
text: the drainpipe next to the cobbler's shop
dialog: and meet me there today at 10 A.M. sharp.
dialog: I will hand myself over to you in
text: exchange for the boy's safe return.
dialog: Cordially,
dialog: Mr. Fox
text: Bean frowns. He studies the letter. He shows it to Boggis and
dialog: Bunce.
speaker_heading: BEAN
dialog: Why'd he write this in letters cut out of
dialog: magazines?
speaker_heading: BUNCE
speaker_heading: (SHRUGS)
dialog: I don't know, but you did the same thing.
speaker_heading: BEAN
speaker_heading: (UNEASY)
dialog: I don't trust this guy. Anyway, set up

scene_heading: INT. ATTIC. DAY
text: The top floor of Bean Annex. The room is filled with boxes of
text: Christmas ornaments, old sports equipment, two stained
text: mattresses, and a broken birdcage. Cobwebs hang from the
text: rafters below the sloped roof.
text: Kristofferson stands with his hands in his pockets looking
text: out between the slats from inside a padlocked apple crate on
text: top of a gun locker in the corner. He clears his throat. He
dialog: calls out politely:
speaker_heading: KRISTOFFERSON
dialog: Could I have a cup of water, please?
text: Kristofferson waits for a reply, but no one answers. He
text: whistles to himself for a minute. He clears his throat again.
text: He calls out:
speaker_heading: KRISTOFFERSON
dialog: Excuse me! Excuse me?
dialog:

dialog:

dialog: 71.
dialog: Silence.
scene_heading: INT. DRAINPIPE. DAY
text: A cement conduit with an iron grating above it. A fast stream

text: the pipe followed by his entourage and Ash. Their steps echo
text: loudly.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Synchronize your clocks. The time is
speaker_heading: NOW --
text: Fox looks at his wrist. He is wearing Rat's plastic, digital,
text: sports-themed wristwatch.
speaker_heading: FOX
text: -- nine forty-five A.M.
text: Everyone checks their watches. Badger points at Fox's wrist.
speaker_heading: BADGER
dialog: Is that Rat's watch?
speaker_heading: FOX
speaker_heading: (VAGUELY)
dialog: No. Originally, no.
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: Well, OK, here's the back-story: when I
dialog: was a teenager I spent a summer working
text: as a bar-back at a jazz pub called
text: Django's where Rat played horn down
dialog: near -- can I tell this another time? We
dialog: should stay focused on what's happening
dialog: right now.
text: Ash comes up to Fox's side and says discreetly:
speaker_heading: ASH
dialog: I should probably ride with you and Kylie
dialog: since it's my fault Kristofferson got
dialog: captured stealing those nutmeg-ginger-
text: apple snaps.
speaker_heading: FOX
speaker_heading: (PUZZLED)
dialog: I didn't understand a word of that
text: sentence, but none of it matters, anyway,

scene_heading: EXT. STREET. DAY
text: An old craftsman looks out from the window of Ferguson
text: Cobblers as he taps little nails into the heel of a loafer. A
text: station-wagon with wood-grain side-panels and a flat tire
text: sits parked on a manhole cover in front of the shop. Boggis,
text: Bunce, and five armed farmhands watch as Bean monkeys with a
text: slim-jim until he gets the car door jimmied.
text: Bean hops inside. He starts the engine, puts his arm over the
text: top of the seat as he looks back out the rear window, and
text: throws the station-wagon into reverse. The farmers clear out
text: of the way as Bean backs up off the manhole cover.
text: Boggis and Bunce stick tools into the manhole cover and lift

scene_heading: EXT. STREET. DAY
text: Boggis, Bunce, and Bean crouch behind the open doors of a
text: pick-up truck with three beagles. Boggis checks his carbine.
text: Bunce loads his shotgun. Bean cocks his Luger. Fox's voice
text: hollers from deep inside the manhole:
speaker_heading: FOX (O.S.)
dialog: Did you bring the boy?
speaker_heading: BEAN
dialog: Of course, we did! Say something, kid!
text: Bunce presses play on a tape recorder. Kristofferson's voice

dialog: 
dialog: 73.
scene_heading: KRISTOFFERSON'S VOICE
dialog: Excuse me! Excuse me?
text: Bunce presses stop.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Fox and his entourage at the bottom off the manhole. Fox
text: scoffs. He smiles and shakes his head.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Come on! That doesn't sound anything like
dialog: him! It's amateur night in Dixie!
text: Badger rapidly slaps two pieces of flint together. A bit
text: chips off, and sparks fly from the break. He blows on some
text: kindling. He takes a pinecone out of a basket.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET. DAY
text: A ribbon of white smoke rises out of the manhole. The three
text: farmers watch curiously as it thickens and turns black. Bean
text: frowns.
speaker_heading: BEAN
dialog: What the cuss is he burning?
text: A blazing pinecone shoots out of the manhole and flies
text: through the air, over the farmers' heads. It lands in a trash
text: can and lights some rubbish on fire. A man with a dart in one
text: hand and a mug of ale in the other comes out of the Nag's
text: Head and pours his beer into the trash can. The fire goes
dialog: out.
text: The three farmers laugh smugly. Bean shouts:
speaker_heading: BEAN
dialog: Is that all you've got, Mr. Fox?
text: Twenty-seven blazing pinecones shoot out of the manhole and
text: hit: a wood-pile on the roof of the Nag's Head, a box of
text: pastry wrappers in the bushes behind Sweetings, a stack of
text: brochures in the window of Harrison Travel, a hay bale in the
text: bed of the pick-up truck, Boggis, Bunce, Bean, and a crate of
text: cam-corder batteries next to the Action 13 camera crew, which
text: explodes. Farmers scatter, grabbing hoses, yelling, and
text: tamping out the flames as the beagles bark, yelp, and
text: scramble in the confusion.
text: Rabbit darts out of the hole and races up the street. Six

speaker_heading: MOLE
text: Twenty-eight pinecones fired! Twenty-two
dialog: targets hit!
text: Mrs. Fox, standing on her ladder, paints black checks quickly

text: set sits in the corner, tuned into Action 13's coverage of
text: the chaos in the street.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Rabbit running full-steam out of the village being pursued by
text: the six farmhands. He hurdles an empty Coke bottle lying on
text: its side in the road.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET. DAY
text: Badger jumps out of the manhole and throws more blazing
text: pinecones at farmers, trucks, parked cars, doors, windows,
text: and the Action 13 camera crew. Seven farmhands chase him down
text: a cobblestone lane.
text: Weasel and Beaver climb out with straws in their paws and
text: start firing blueberries toward the disoriented beagles. The
text: beagles eat blueberries. They fall over. Eight farmhands
text: chase Weasel and Beaver up a wooded path.
text: Rickity, the field mouse, bounds out of the hole and leaps
text: into the fracas. He fires a rubber band at Bunce off a
text: paperclip. It snaps Bunce in the corner of his eye. Rickity
text: lets out a little whoop.
text: There is a small explosion and a burst of flames blasts from
text: the manhole. Fox and Kylie jump out and run over to a vehicle
text: with a tarp over it parked in front of Paddington Automotive.
text: Fox whips off the tarp, revealing a miniature motorcycle with
text: a sidecar.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Fox driving the motorcycle with Kylie in the sidecar. They
text: both wear helmets and goggles. Thunder rumbles in the

speaker_heading: KYLIE
dialog: Are you scared of wolves?

speaker_heading: FOX

speaker_heading: KYLIE
dialog: Well, I have a thing about thunder!
speaker_heading: FOX
speaker_heading: (ANNOYED)
dialog: Why? That's stupid!
text: Ash pokes his head up from the rear compartment of the
text: sidecar. He also wears a helmet and goggles. His white cape
text: flutters behind him. He shouts:
speaker_heading: ASH
dialog: I don't like needles!
text: Fox and Kylie look to Ash in disbelief. Fox says furiously:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Where'd you come from again? How'd you
dialog: get in the sidecar? I feel like I'm
dialog: losing my mind!
text: Fox angrily steers toward a small mound of dirt. They jump it
text: slightly and fly over a little ditch. Ash yelps
text: enthusiastically as Fox drives them back onto the road.
scene_heading: INT. HELICOPTER. DAY
text: A pilot with a red moustache and a South African accent flies
text: Bean's chopper. He wears a Bean, inc. patch on his shoulder.

speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: I've got a fox on a motorcycle with a
text: littler fox and what looks to be an

scene_heading: EXT. BEAN'S COMPOUND. DAY
text: The Bean, inc. windmill spins briskly in the dusty winds.
text: Shutters on the farmhouse bang open and shut. Leaves rustle
text: on the branches of the apple trees. A few stray turkeys
text: wander in the yard. A white-washed brick pile six stories
text: tall sits apart from the other structures. The doors to its
text: courtyard are made of iron and painted yellow. This is Bean
dialog: Annex.
text: The front gates of the farm are open, and a gardener waters
text: vegetables next to the driveway. Fox, Kylie, and Ash look out
text: from a high branch over a reinforced concrete and barbed-wire
text: security barricade.
speaker_heading: FOX
text: That's the annex over there on the right.
text: Ash nods. Kylie does not respond.
speaker_heading: FOX
text: The white building over there on the
dialog: right.
text: Pause. Fox looks to Kylie.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Kylie?
text: Kylie turns to Fox and stares at him vacantly. Fox says
speaker_heading: SHARPLY:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Kylie!
speaker_heading: KYLIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: (SUDDENLY)
dialog: I did it!
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: When? I didn't see it!
text: Kylie makes his slight gesture with his paw. The gardener
text: puts three turnips into a basket and rides away on his
dialog: bicycle.
text: Fox, Kylie, and Ash scramble down the tree trunk. They come
text: out of the bushes on their motorcycle and ride through the
text: gates, across the yard, past the wandering turkeys. They park
text: outside the courtyard doors to Bean Annex and jump off the
dialog: motorcycle.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 77.
text: Fox climbs onto Kylie's shoulders and tries the knobs. They
dialog: are locked.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Kylie, you got a credit card?
speaker_heading: KYLIE
dialog: (digging in his pockets)
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: FOX
speaker_heading: (IMPRESSED)
dialog: See, this is what I was saying about how
dialog: good you are at just being available for
scene_heading: WHATEVER --
text: Kylie hands Fox a World Traveler Titanium Card. Fox frowns.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: A Titanium Card? How the cuss did you
dialog: qualify for this?
speaker_heading: KYLIE
speaker_heading: (SHRUGS)
dialog: I pay my bills on time. I've always had
dialog: good credit.
text: Fox examines the card with mild resentment. He picks the lock
text: and opens the doors.
text: The courtyard has high walls and a gravel floor. On one side,
text: there are ten trash cans, a stack of newspapers, and a
text: compost heap. On the other side, there is an old, rusted,
text: broken-down tractor and a new one. By far the largest,
text: fattest, toughest beagle yet lies sleeping in the middle.
text: White foam froths around its mouth as it breathes heavily.
text: Its collar is hooked to a thick chain. A tag around its neck
text: reads Spitz.
text: Fox, Kylie, and Ash stop in their tracks. The beagle opens
text: his eyes. Fox turns to Kylie.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Give me a blueberry.
text: Kylie looks surprised. He shrugs. He shakes his head and
text: gestures, I don't have any. Fox frowns. He throws up his
text: hands in the air. Kylie makes a frustrated face. Fox points
text: at him. Kylie looks away and snorts angrily. Fox looks away
text: and spits at the ground. Ash says quietly:
speaker_heading: ASH
dialog: What's that white stuff around his mouth?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: KYLIE
speaker_heading: (SQUINTING)
dialog: I think he eats soap.
text: Fox sees an amber, plastic pharmacy bottle on a shelf above
text: some bags of fertilizer. It's reads:
dialog: Drug: Phenomoxylcarbobubytol, 10 mg
speaker_heading: NAME: SPITZ
speaker_heading: BREED: BEAGLE
speaker_heading: For: RABIES (chronic)
dialog: Other: Take with meat, do not operate heavy machinery
text: Fox frowns. He says grimly:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: That's not soap.
speaker_heading: KYLIE
speaker_heading: (HESITATES)
dialog: Well, then why does he have that bubbly --
speaker_heading: FOX
text: He's rabid. With rabies. I've heard about
dialog: this beagle.
text: The beagle stands up. Fox says carefully:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Easy, boy.
text: Fox takes a cautious step toward the beagle. He holds out the
text: back of his paw for the beagle to sniff. He says back over
text: his shoulder to Kylie and Ash:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: I'm going to try to befriend him. I feel
text: like there's a tenderness in his eyes.
text: Fox takes another step. He makes a soft, kissing noise. The
text: beagle watches him calmly.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Yes, I'm right. He's a good boy. A little
dialog: lonely, maybe, but --
text: Fox takes another cautious step.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: -- but terribly sweet. Hello, there, boy.
dialog: Is your name Spitz? That's German, isn't
dialog: it?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: KYLIE
dialog: (aside, to Ash)
dialog: I thought he said you never look a beagle
text: in the eye.
speaker_heading: FOX
speaker_heading: (COAXINGLY)
dialog: Why, you're just as sweet as a --
text: Fox and the beagle lock eyes. The pupils of the beagle's eyes
text: contract then completely disappear, and the whites turn
text: bright red. Fox's eyes open wider than their sockets.
text: The rabid beagle erupts ballistically, attacking like an
text: enraged maniac. His chain rips out of the cement. Fox, Kylie,
text: and Ash shriek and scream, sprinting frantically around the
text: courtyard as the rabid beagle, frothing, roaring, and
text: snapping, tries desperately to kill them. Fox shouts, his
text: voice cracking like a grandmother's:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Climb the trellis!
text: In well under a second, Fox, Kylie, and Ash scale the trellis
text: six stories -- Kylie's pants catching on a nail and ripping
text: off on the way up -- and find themselves standing on the roof
text: of Bean Annex. Kylie wears blue Fruit-of-the-Looms with a
text: pattern of stars, moons, and planets on them. They all look
text: down at the rabid beagle, which continues to pitch an insane
text: fit, running in circles after its tail at the bottom of the
text: courtyard.
text: Fox takes in their new surroundings. He says, pleased:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: So the attic is probably in the area
dialog: right up around here somewhere, I figure,
dialog: huh?
text: Kylie and Ash, panting and dripping with sweat, both stare at
text: Fox vacantly.
text: (NOTE: a second set of alternate eyeballs indicating Kylie's
text: vacant look will be used for Ash in this shot.)
speaker_heading: FOX
speaker_heading: (IRRITATED)
dialog: Come on, guys. Stay with me. We did good.
dialog: That's just some dog. Let's not get
text: traumatized.

dialog: 80.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOF. DAY
text: Bean's helicopter lands on top of the Nag's Head. Fires
text: smolder and farmers continue to chase around after animals in
text: the village streets below. Boggis, Bunce, and Bean, leaning
text: over and holding onto their hats, run to the chopper and
text: climb inside. They take off.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: The street below. An orange and yellow Citroen van screeches
text: into the melee. Painted yellow letters spell Badoit et Fils,
text: Destruction des Animaux Nuisibles on the side of it with an
text: image of a trapped fox.
text: An old man with a grey moustache and a young man with a black
text: moustache, both dressed in orange-and-yellow-striped
text: uniforms, jump out of the van. They open the side door and
text: start unloading stacks of metal cages.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Rabbit still running full-steam down a country lane being
text: pursued by the six farmhands.
scene_heading: INT. ATTIC. DAY
text: Kristofferson stands inside the apple crate leaning against
text: the wall with his legs crossed and one arm akimbo with his
text: hand on his hip. There is a clanking sound from above.
text: Kristofferson looks up.
text: A trap door in the ceiling creaks open. Fox, Kylie, and Ash
text: look inside, down at Kristofferson. Kristofferson smiles
text: oddly and says in a surprised, fancy-meeting-you-here voice:
speaker_heading: KRISTOFFERSON
dialog: Hi!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Fox and Kylie lowering Ash into the room with three different-
text: colored shoelaces tied together and belted around his waist.
text: Ash holds the shoelace and keeps a paw behind his back like a
text: mountaineer. His feet touch down on the shelf. He runs to the
text: apple crate and jiggles the padlock. He hesitates. He says
speaker_heading: SUDDENLY:
speaker_heading: ASH
dialog: Can I get one of those karate lessons
dialog: real quick?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: KRISTOFFERSON
speaker_heading: (LONG PAUSE)
dialog: OK. Normally, we start with some
dialog: breathing exercises and such. Stand like
dialog: this.
text: Kristofferson stands with his paws clasped in front of him.
text: Ash mimics this.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: A fox-trap hanging from a chain suspended above the alley
text: behind the Nag's Head Tavern. A second one hangs behind
text: Sweetings Bakery. A third one hangs behind Harrison Travel. A
text: fourth one hangs behind St. John's Coin-op Laundry. A fifth
text: one hangs behind Ferguson Cobblers.
text: Rickity curiously examines a little, hanging wire. He mutters
scene_heading: TO HIMSELF:
speaker_heading: RICKITY
dialog: Is this spring-loaded?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Kristofferson continuing Ash's karate lesson:
speaker_heading: KRISTOFFERSON
text: This next part is mental. Position
dialog: yourself on the balls of your feet.
text: Kristofferson stands lightly poised with his arms out. Ash
text: mimics this.
speaker_heading: KRISTOFFERSON
dialog: Close your eyes.
text: Kristofferson closes his eyes. So does Ash. So do Fox and
text: Kylie. Kristofferson says mystically:
speaker_heading: KRISTOFFERSON
dialog: You weigh less than a slice of bread.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Each fox-trap in rapid succession as it falls on: Rickity,
text: Badger, Weasel, and Beaver. The two small rabbits watch from
text: a sewer-gutter drain under the street-curb. They panic. They
text: race down a pipe, into a tunnel, and through a conduit.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Kristofferson continuing Ash's karate lesson:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: KRISTOFFERSON
dialog: Let's review the principle agility
dialog: techniques: jumping, flipping, landing.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Mrs. Fox looking down from her ladder at the three, panting
text: rabbits. She looks stunned. She motions to her mural/map and
speaker_heading: SAYS:
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
dialog: Show me where they are!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: The two small rabbits, Mrs. Rabbit, Mrs. Badger, Mole, and
text: Mrs. Fox each furiously digging a new tunnel.
speaker_heading: KRISTOFFERSON (V.0.)
dialog: Now for a rudimentary version of the
text: cyclone chop.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Kristofferson continuing Ash's karate lesson:
speaker_heading: KRISTOFFERSON
dialog: First, you need to get a running start,
dialog: which, obviously, I can't do in here,
dialog: then, as you arrive at the destination of
dialog: the chop --
speaker_heading: (DEMONSTRATING)
text: -- lean and thrust into the point of
text: contact, paw remains open and straight,
dialog: then withdraw instantaneously. Remember,
text: it's the pull-back that matters. The pull-
speaker_heading: BACK --
speaker_heading: (DEMONSTRATING)
dialog: -- generates the force of the impact.
speaker_heading: ASH
speaker_heading: (IMMEDIATELY)
dialog: Got it.
text: Ash walks ten paces away to the far end of the shelf. Fox and
text: Kylie watch from above. Kylie says excitedly:
speaker_heading: KYLIE
dialog: He's going to do it!
text: Fox makes a face that says, I'm not so sure. Ash takes a deep
text: breath. He screams at the top of his lungs as he sprints
text: toward the apple crate:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: ASH
dialog: Ki-ya!
text: Ash's toe catches on a loose nail. He somersaults twice
text: through the air and bounces off the side of the apple crate,
text: which falls off the shelf.
text: Kristofferson braces himself. The apple crate hits the floor
text: and shatters into pieces. Kristofferson lies among the
text: wreckage.
text: Ash looks over the side of the shelf. Fox and Kylie watch
text: from above, grimacing.
speaker_heading: ASH
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: KRISTOFFERSON
speaker_heading: (DAZED)
dialog: That's all right. You were just trying to
text: unlock the apple crate.
speaker_heading: ASH
dialog: No, I mean I'm sorry about --
speaker_heading: KRISTOFFERSON
dialog: (picking himself up)
dialog: Oh, you mean from before. The apology you
dialog: owed me which you never actually said.
speaker_heading: ASH
dialog: Yeah.
text: Kristofferson nods sadly. He takes a deep breath. He nods
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: KRISTOFFERSON
dialog: That's all right, too. Throw me the
dialog: shoelace, please.
text: Ash smiles.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Badger trapped in his cage. He hears something. He looks
text: quickly down the alley. The old, orange van turns the corner
text: and approaches, bumping over potholes. Badger shrinks into
text: the corner of the cage and mutters grimly to himself:
speaker_heading: BADGER
dialog: Badoit et fils.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 84.
text: A cobblestone beside Badger suddenly drops straight down and
text: disappears into the ground. Badger recoils, scared and
dialog: confused.
text: Mrs. Fox pokes her head up through the hole. She is beaded
text: with perspiration and breathes heavily. Her fur is wildly
text: dishevelled. She looks to the van driving up the alley. She
text: looks to Badger. She extends her paw to him and says
speaker_heading: FIERCELY:
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
dialog: Let's go!
scene_heading: EXT. YARD. DAY
text: Fox, Kylie, Ash, and Kristofferson come around the side of
text: the building. They run to their motorcycle, outside the
text: courtyard doors. They freeze.
text: The front gates to the compound are closed and bolted. Bean's
text: helicopter waits on top of the vegetable garden with its
text: rotar-blades whirling. Boggis, Bunce, and Bean stand in front
text: of Bean Annex with their weapons drawn.
text: Fox sees his tail around Bean's collar. His eyes narrow. His
text: jaw sets. He says to himself with growing emotion:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Your tractors uprooted my tree. Your
dialog: posse hunted my family. Your gunmen
dialog: kidnapped my nephew. Your rat insulted my
dialog: wife -- and you shot off my tail.
speaker_heading: (STEELY)
dialog: I'm not leaving here without that neck-
dialog: tie.
text: Bean smiles his sickly smile. Fox smiles back defiantly.
text: Kylie looks utterly baffled. Ash says mystically:
speaker_heading: ASH
text: I weigh less than a slice of bread.
speaker_heading: FOX
speaker_heading: (HESITATES)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ASH
dialog: I'll be right back.
text: Ash runs. Fox, Kylie, and Kristofferson watch, shocked, as
text: Ash sprints back to the courtyard doors. The three farmers
text: open fire at him. Fox, Kylie, and Kristofferson duck and take
text: cover behind a hay-bale.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 85.
text: Ash dodges bullets. He jumps off the balls of his feet with
text: his arms out over a sprinkler-pipe and swings like a gymnast
text: onto a clothesline, then flies through the air doing another
text: of his spectacularly awkward four-armed and three-legged back-
text: flips. He lands on the handle of one of the courtyard doors
scene_heading: AND SCREAMS:
speaker_heading: ASH
dialog: Ki-ya!
text: Ash cyclone-chops the doorknob. The lock clicks. Ash's eyes
text: light up.
text: Ash drops to the ground. He digs a hole and burrows into the
text: dirt as bullets fly everywhere. He breathes in through his
text: nose and out through his mouth. Fox watches with his jaw
text: hanging open.
text: The courtyard doors smash apart and the rabid beagle tears
text: out into the vegetable garden growling, foaming, and
text: thrashing crazily. The farmers shriek and scream and run
text: around, panicking, with their guns blazing.
text: Fox, Kylie, Ash, and Kristofferson jump onto their
text: motorcycle. The beagle rips the tail from Bean's neck, shreds
text: it, chews it up, and swallows it. Fox deflates for an
text: instant, then recovers. He looks to Ash on the back of the
text: motorcycle, behind him, with his hands around Fox's waist. He
dialog: says with the deepest affection and respect:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Ash, that was pure, wild animal
dialog: craziness. You're an athlete.
text: Ash swallows. He beams. He sits up straighter.
text: (NOTE: from this point onwards, an alternate version of Ash
dialog: will be used which is slightly taller, slightly leaner, and
text: animated slightly more gracefully.)
text: Fox kick-starts the motorcycle and races across the farm.
text: Boggis, Bunce, and Bean scramble onto the roof of a car port
text: with an old, white Mercedes convertible under it. The
text: snarling beagle barks and snaps below them. They watch as:
text: Fox steers the motorcycle toward a broken apple cart at the
text: edge of the property. He guns the motor and yells:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Holy swearing cuss!!!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 86.
text: Fox races the motorcycle up the apple cart, into the air, and
text: over the concrete barricade. They land in the middle of the
text: road, skidding, and speed off down the hill.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Boggis, Bunce, and Bean watching from the roof of the car
text: port. Boggis turns to Bean and says, deadpan, needling him:
speaker_heading: BOGGIS
dialog: Franklin? You got any final twist for
dialog: this plot?
speaker_heading: BEAN
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: Yeah!
text: Bean grabs Boggis by the neck and throttles him. Bunce starts
text: throwing punches. Bean holds him back by the forehead. Boggis
text: kicks Bunce in the stomach. They brawl chaotically while the
text: rabid beagle continues to go bananas below them.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Each fox-trap with a cobblestone missing underneath it and a
text: hole in the ground. The old man with the grey moustache turns
text: to his son and says with a strong French accent:
speaker_heading: BADOIT
dialog: Cuss.
scene_heading: INT. SEWER SYSTEM. DAY
text: Mrs. Fox sits anxiously at the bottom of her ladder. Badger,
text: Weasel, Rickity, the two small rabbits, and the others sit,
text: exhausted, in the dark cavern, passing a jar of cider. Mole
scene_heading: INTERRUPTS:
speaker_heading: MOLE
dialog: Stand by!
text: Everyone looks to Mole. Mole is holding the tin can with the
text: string attached to it to his ear. He nods and says urgently:
speaker_heading: MOLE
dialog: I just intercepted a high-frequency radio
dialog: signal with the can --
dialog: (gestures with the tin can)
dialog: -- and I think they're on their way home!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 87.
text: Mrs. Fox jumps up, embraces Mole, and kisses him on the
text: snout. Mole blushes.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Rabbit still running full-steam back into the village being
text: pursued by the six farmhands. He comes to the manhole where
text: they started and darts into it. The six farmhands stop at the
text: manhole and look down. They go straight to the Nag's Head,
text: walk inside, and close the door behind them.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD. DAY
text: Fox, Kylie, Ash, and Kristofferson ride down a country road.
text: Kylie sees something across the meadow. He says warily:
speaker_heading: KYLIE
dialog: Don't turn around!
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: What?
text: Fox turns around. A huge, wild, grey wolf with ice-blue eyes
text: stands on a rock fifty feet away from them. Fox slams on the
text: brakes. The motorcycle slides to a halt.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Where'd he come from?
speaker_heading: (LOUDLY)
dialog: Where'd you come from? What are you doing
dialog: here?
text: Pause. Fox points toward the wolf:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Canis lupus!
dialog: Fox points to himself:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Vulpes Vulpes!
text: The wolf does not answer. Fox, Kylie, Ash, and Kristofferson
text: watch idling from the motorcycle.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: I don't think he speaks English or Latin.
speaker_heading: (LOUDLY)
dialog: Pensez-vous que 1'hiver sera rude?
speaker_heading: (ASIDE)
dialog: I'm asking if he thinks we're in for a
dialog: hard winter.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 88.
text: The wolf shakes his head. Fox nods.
speaker_heading: FOX
text: He doesn't seem to know.
text: Silence. Fox shouts to the wolf with a strange hitch in his
speaker_heading: VOICE:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: I have a phobia of wolves!
text: The wolf does not answer. It breathes heavily with its mouth
text: open. Its teeth are long, sharp, and yellow. Its tongue hangs
text: out, and its eyes are wild. Fox looks back at it with the
text: identical expression for a minute, mesmerized -- then Fox
text: closes his mouth and his eyes soften.
text: Fox raises his paw in the air. The wolf blinks a few times.
text: It raises its paw in the air. It turns away and trots off
text: into the woods. Fox says wistfully:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: What a beautiful creature. Wish him luck,
dialog: boys.
text: Fox guns the motor. Gravel spits from under the spinning
text: tires, and they tear off down the road. The shot booms down
text: into the ground, below the grass, through buried pebbles,
text: layers of soil, and subterranean mineral deposits.
speaker_heading: TITLE:
scene_heading: THREE DAYS LATER (2 1/2 Fox Weeks)
text: The shot continues to descend past Badger and his family
text: having dinner in a nicely furnished drain-pipe, past Rabbit
text: and his family watching Magnum, P.I. on the stolen, portable
text: television set in a well-appointed cement tunnel, past Beaver
text: and Mrs. Beaver hosting Mole and Weasel for cocktails in a
text: tasteful sewer-conduit.
text: The shot stops in a small chamber adjacent to the brick
text: cavern. The walls are filled with electrical cables, wires,
text: pipes, and a large, new mural which depicts the Fox's former
text: view of the valley as seen from their tree with a trompe
text: 1'oeil window-frame around it. It is signed Felicity Fox.
text: Ash and Kristofferson sit Indian-style meditating on a
text: braided rug. Mrs. Fox works mixing paints and turpentine at
text: an easel in the corner. There is an armchair with a folded-up
text: copy of the Gazette on its cushion in the center of the room
text: under a glowing lamp. Classical music plays on a radio.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 89.
text: Fox swings his head into the room from a tunnel. He says
speaker_heading: GENTLY:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: My darlings?
text: Everyone looks to Fox. He signals them to follow him.
scene_heading: INT. DRAINPIPE. NIGHT
text: The cement conduit with the iron grating above it. Fox and
text: his family walk briskly down the pipe. A knitted, woolen,
text: artificial tail has been sewn into the seat of Fox's
text: trousers.
speaker_heading: ASH
dialog: Where are we going?
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Nobody knows.
speaker_heading: ASH
text: We were in the middle of a meditation
dialog: practice.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Watch your step.
text: Fox takes everyone through an opening and starts climbing a
text: metal ladder. He says theatrically:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Let's see, now. Where does this lead?
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
dialog: Oh, no, Foxy. It's filthy.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Keep a good grip, everyone.
speaker_heading: ASH
dialog: This better be worth it.
speaker_heading: FOX
text: I think I see a little sliver of light.
dialog: What's this? Is that a door?
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
dialog: You're a terrible actor, Foxy.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: KRISTOFFERSON
dialog: Do you smell something? Is that --
speaker_heading: (SNIFFS TWICE)
dialog: -- freon?
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Shh. I'm going to crack open this trap
text: door and see if something's on the other
dialog: side. I highly doubt it, though. There's
text: probably just more sewer.
text: Fox clears his throat. Pause.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: You know, wouldn't it be surprising if --
speaker_heading: ASH
dialog: Open it.
text: Fox pushes open the trap door and crawls out. Everyone
text: follows him.
scene_heading: INT. SUPERMARKET. NIGHT
text: Fox and his family stand in the middle of an aisle at the
text: center of a large grocery store. To their left is the
text: refrigerated section of milk, eggs, meat, fish, and cheese.
text: To their right are canned goods, breakfast cereal, laundry
text: detergent, rice, pasta, and condiments. The lights are half-
text: dimmed, and a metal grate is closed over the front windows.
text: There are no people. Fox says casually:
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Hey, look! There's a whole, enormous,
dialog: glorious, gigantic supermarket up here!
text: Ash and Kristofferson seem dumbstruck. Fox raises an eyebrow
text: and smiles at Mrs. Fox. She puts her arm around his shoulder.
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
dialog: You really are kind of a quote-unquote
dialog: fantastic fox.
speaker_heading: FOX
speaker_heading: (SHRUGS)
dialog: I try. I guess now that Kristofferson's
dialog: dad's already down to single-pneumonia
dialog: and getting better, he'll be going home
dialog: soon, huh?
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
dialog: Actually, when he spoke to me from the
dialog: hospital, he said he was already talking
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 91.
scene_heading: MRS. FOX (cont'd)
dialog: to Weasel about real-estate availabil-
dialog: ities down in our sewer system.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Oh, really? Well, now's the time to buy.
text: Kylie comes around the end of the aisle pushing a miniature
text: shopping cart filled with jars of jelly, jam, olives,
text: pickles, and honey, plus three loaves of bread, Band-Aids,
text: toothpaste, and a carton of strawberry ice cream. He says
scene_heading: BRIGHTLY:
speaker_heading: KYLIE
dialog: Did I hear my name?
speaker_heading: FOX
speaker_heading: (SMILING)
dialog: Not down here, you didn't.
speaker_heading: KYLIE
scene_heading: (SMILING BLANKLY)
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Because we were talking about other
dialog: things.
speaker_heading: KYLIE
speaker_heading: (RESIGNED)
dialog: Oh, well.
text: Fox looks at Ash, who is studying a twelve-pack of tropical
dialog: juice punch-boxes.
speaker_heading: FOX
text: The white cape rather suits him, doesn't
dialog: it? Actually, I had to do quite a bit of
dialog: searching myself before I found a look
dialog: that really flattered me. Remember those
dialog: horseshoe cuff-links?
text: Fox and Mrs. Fox crack-up laughing. Fox notices something and
text: stops. He stares at Mrs. Fox strangely. She is glowing. She
text: hesitates. She shrugs.
scene_heading: MRS. FOX
dialog: I'm pregnant again.
text: Fox is confused and moved. He holds Mrs. Fox's face in his
text: paws. She smiles. Ash interrupts:
speaker_heading: ASH
dialog: Dad?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 92.
text: Fox and Mrs. Fox look to Ash. An empty punch-box lies on its
text: side behind him with a straw sticking out of it. There is a
text: huge, purple stain all over the front of his white shirt.
speaker_heading: ASH
dialog: Should we dance?
text: Pause. Everyone breaks out giddily dancing an ecstatic jig.
text: Kylie waltzes the cart in circles. Fox spins Mrs. Fox.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: A wide shot of all sixteen aisles of the supermarket stacked
text: with boxes, cartons, cans, bottles, bags, and jars of every
text: possible variety of food. The family of foxes continues to
text: dance at the distant end of the center aisle.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET. DAY
text: Boggis, Bunce, and Bean sit silently in folding metal chairs
text: around the manhole. Boggis's carbine rests across his lap.
text: Bunce's shotgun hangs from a strap over his shoulder. Bean
text: cleans his Luger. Petey sits on a cider box outside the Nag's
text: Head strumming his guitar in the background. The bartender
text: pulls the shutters shut and flips a sign on the door to
text: Closed. Petey starts singing his song as the credits roll.
text: The sun sets. The farmers sit waiting in the dark.
