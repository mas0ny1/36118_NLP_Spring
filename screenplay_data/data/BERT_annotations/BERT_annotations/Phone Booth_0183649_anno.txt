scene_heading: NEW YORK CITY - AERIAL VIEW OF DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN - DAY
scene_heading: MULTIPLE STREET SCENES - DAY
text: The sidewalks crowded as usual. A sea of humanity. People
dialog: come and go -- always in a hurry. Oblivious of one another.
text: A TRAFFIC JAM -- A STREET being torn up by construction
text: workers; A SANITATION TRUCK loading up refuse; VENDORS
text: PEDDLING nuts and salted pretzels; PANHANDLERS blocking a
text: passerby. Intimidating. Demanding. Almost mocking.
text: We're surrounded by the teeming life of the city as we've
text: come to expect it -- complete with a cacophony of sound.
text: MULTIPLE CUTS -- Phone kiosks and phone booths on the East
text: Side and West Side -- uptown and down.
text: One frustrated caller has lost his money in the slot and he
text: takes it out on the equipment -- smashing the receiver
text: violently against the coin box until the instrument splinters
text: into a dozen pieces.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
text: There are 237,911 pay telephones in
text: the five burroughs of the city of
dialog: New York. Many of them are still
dialog: in working order.
scene_heading: DOZENS OF QUICK CUTS --
text: NEW YORKERS on the phone in extreme close up. We don't hear
dialog: the words. Only the facial expressions inform us that these
text: are human beings under tremendous pressure. Life in the city
dialog: is wearing them down.
scene_heading: MULTIPLE SHOTS - JUST MOUTHS
text: Lips jabbering into receivers. Cross-cut against one
dialog: another.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: Despite increased usage of cellular
dialog: devices, an estimated four and a
dialog: half million New Yorkers and two
dialog: million visitors still utilize pay
text: telephones on a regular basis. At
dialog: thirty-five cents a pop... for the
text: first three minutes.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON CORNER IN MID-MANHATTAN - DAY
text: There's a phone booth situated on the southeast side of the
dialog: street.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: You're looking at the telephone
text: booth at the corner of 45th Street
dialog: and 8th Avenue in the heart of the
dialog: Manhattan theatrical district. It
dialog: has been scheduled to be removed
text: and replaced by a kiosk. It's one
dialog: of the few remaining phone booths
text: left in the city.
text: CAMERA MOVES IN on the irate caller in the booth -- a very
text: well-dressed gray-haired lady -- totally conservative in
dialog: appearance.
speaker_heading: WOMAN IN BOOTH
dialog: (into receiver)
dialog: You have lied to me for the last
dialog: time, you lowlife prick bastard! I
dialog: don't ever want to hear the sound
dialog: of your fucking voice again.
dialog: (listens)
dialog: Yes, well fuck you, too!
text: She slams down the receiver and exits. The booth remains
text: vacant for a brief interval.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: At least three hundred calls daily
dialog: originate from this booth. The
dialog: coins are collected twice a day.
dialog: This booth has been burglarized
dialog: forty-one times in the last six
dialog: months.
text: Someone is approaching the booth, fishing in his pocket for
text: coins. This is STUART SHEPARD, snappily dressed, his hair
text: styled and his nails manicured. Here is a man who clearly
text: takes excellent care of himself. He sports a Donna Karen
text: suit and silk Armani tie.
text: He's about to step into the booth when he's accosted by a
text: middle-aged man in a soiled apron who's run out of a nearby
text: restaurant and has finally caught up with him.
speaker_heading: MARIO
dialog: Stu, we got to talk.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Wish I could accommodate you,
dialog: Mario, but this is my busy time of
dialog: day.
speaker_heading: MARIO
dialog: How come you cross the street every
dialog: time you go past the restaurant?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Why don't I stop in later for some
dialog: lunch?
speaker_heading: MARIO
dialog: There's no more drinks or free
text: meals until the restaurant starts
dialog: showing up in the columns like you
dialog: said.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I'm doing my level best for you
dialog: people.
speaker_heading: MARIO
dialog: One lousy mention in the Post and
dialog: you expect to eat for six months!
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I got the food critic from the
dialog: Village Voice all lined up to give
dialog: you a review.
speaker_heading: MARIO
dialog: That's what you tell me last July.
dialog: And he never shows.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I was allowing you time to expand
text: the menu. Wallpaper the bathrooms,
dialog: for God sakes. You get only one
dialog: shot with these fucking critics and
dialog: I don't want you to blow a rare
dialog: opportunity.
speaker_heading: MARIO
dialog: You the one blowing it. How long
dialog: you think you can fuck everybody?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Hold on right there. I've got a
dialog: very excellent reputation around
dialog: this town.
speaker_heading: MARIO
dialog: So how come you take two nice suits
dialog: of clothes from Harry and never get
dialog: his daughter on David Letterman?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Hell, I'm not an agent. I'm a
dialog: publicist.
speaker_heading: MARIO
dialog: Mister, you're nothing!
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Believe me, Valerie's on the
dialog: waiting list to audition. Harry's
dialog: got no complaints. He just let me
dialog: pick out this tie the other day.
speaker_heading: MARIO
dialog: That Harry's a damn fool!
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Mario, please let me make this up
dialog: to you. How about I arrange for
dialog: the opening night party for this
dialog: new off-Broadway show I'm handling
dialog: -- to be held at your place with
dialog: local TV coverage on nine and
dialog: eleven? I mean I had it promised
dialog: to another client -- who actually
dialog: pays me money. But it isn't firmed
dialog: up yet. And I could throw it your
dialog: way. Maybe.
speaker_heading: MARIO
dialog: What is involved?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: You'd toss in the buffet for say
dialog: seventy or eighty. The producers
dialog: would supply their own vino, of
dialog: course. I'd deliver you a
dialog: truckload of celebrities. And if
dialog: they like the food, they'll all
dialog: come back, naturally.
speaker_heading: MARIO
dialog: What celebrities?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: You want Liza Minelli? An Oscar
dialog: winner. Or Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.?
speaker_heading: MARIO
dialog: Is he still alive?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I saw him last night going into the
dialog: Four Seasons. I'll bring you over
dialog: a whole VIP list when we come by
dialog: for dinner.
speaker_heading: MARIO
dialog: How come everybody wants to eat but
dialog: nobody wants to pay?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: You can't think small like that.
dialog: Hey, you still feature musicians
dialog: Fridays and Saturdays?
speaker_heading: MARIO
dialog: At least they work for their meals.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: What about Harry's daughter as an
dialog: extra added attraction? She'll
dialog: belt out five or six showtunes --
dialog: two sets a night -- and it won't
dialog: cost you a fucking nickel.
speaker_heading: MARIO
dialog: How come?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Star Showcase! Let me handle
dialog: setting that up. And when she
text: eventually goes on Letterman,
dialog: she'll announce I'm currently
text: appearing over at Mario's fine
dialog: supper club. Right over CBS she'll
dialog: say that, Mario.
speaker_heading: MARIO
dialog: You're full of shit. You know
dialog: that? All bullshit!
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: That's just a vulgar word for PR.
text: (placing an arm around
dialog: him)
dialog: Mario, you can't hurt my feelings.
dialog: Even when I was a kid and they
dialog: hurled certain invectives my way,
dialog: it never bothered me. Other kids
dialog: would fall apart if anybody called
dialog: them a fucking name. Me, I just
dialog: loved the attention! 'Shit-for-
dialog: brains' -- that's what the bigger
dialog: kids named me. And I answered to
dialog: it. Hey, 'shit-for brains'
dialog: reporting for duty. Everybody
dialog: loved me for that. I could take
dialog: abuse. After a while, I kind of
dialog: wore them down. There was nothing
dialog: more they could say to me. So they
dialog: stopped. I kind of missed it.
speaker_heading: MARIO
dialog: I'm sorry I even talked to you.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I'll bet your loving wife put you
dialog: up to this. She saw me pass by and
dialog: she sent you out in the street.
dialog: But I don't hold it against you
dialog: personally -- you still serve up
text: superior veal chop.
dialog: (entering phone booth)
dialog: Now I got urgent business to
dialog: conduct, Mario.
text: He slides the booth closed in Mario's face.
text: The frustrated restaurateur glares at him through the glass
text: before giving up and walking off -- talking to himself as he
text: goes up the block.
text: INSIDE THE BOOTH, Stu inserts his thirty-five cents and
text: dials.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Hello, Mavis, sweet creature.
speaker_heading: MAVIS' VOICE
dialog: Where have you been? Do you think
dialog: I have nothing to do but wait
dialog: around for you to call?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I'm only a few minutes late,
dialog: loveliest individual on earth.
speaker_heading: MAVIS' VOICE
dialog: Stu, I'm so lonely. When can I see
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Good news in that arena. Kelly
text: goes into rehearsal as of Monday.
dialog: You know how dedicated she is. By
text: the time she gets back from dancing
dialog: her ass off, she goes right to
dialog: sleep. We'll have both our days
dialog: and certain nights. Not to mention
dialog: when they take the show on the
dialog: road.
speaker_heading: MAVIS' VOICE
dialog: How long is that for?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Four to five weeks -- minimum.
speaker_heading: MAVIS' VOICE
dialog: Maybe I should quit my job so we
dialog: can be together full time.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I wouldn't do that.
speaker_heading: MAVIS' VOICE
dialog: Sometimes I think if I have to give
dialog: one more fucking manicure...
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: That's how you met me.
speaker_heading: MAVIS' VOICE
dialog: I never saw a worse set of nails.
dialog: Bit right down to the quick.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I'm much better groomed since
dialog: you've been looking after me.
speaker_heading: MAVIS' VOICE
dialog: I'm glad you admit it.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Even Kelly remarked on it when I
dialog: first met her.
speaker_heading: MAVIS' VOICE
dialog: She could care less how you look.
dialog: She's only interested in pushing
dialog: her own career. Some wife you're
dialog: stuck with!
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: The marriage is not without its
dialog: compensations. Do you imagine I
dialog: could afford that apartment on what
dialog: I'm earning? Not with everybody
dialog: cutting back on the publicity. Not
dialog: to mention a million college
dialog: graduates coming into the
dialog: profession trying to cut me out.
dialog: And one thing you can't expect from
dialog: your clients is loyalty. They get
text: a couple of bad notices, they dump
dialog: you. Goodbye.
speaker_heading: MAVIS' VOICE
dialog: Don't go.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I wasn't saying goodbye to you. I
dialog: was saying how the clients try to
dialog: give you the wave off without even
dialog: a month's notice.
text: A conservative businessman now stands outside the booth
text: waiting to use it. He deliberately glances at his watch a
text: few times to demonstrate his impatience. This bothers Stu
text: who slides the booth open a crack.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: What? Is your watch busted? It's
dialog: twenty after eleven and I'm gonna
dialog: be occupied indefinitely with my
dialog: transaction. So get out of my
dialog: face!
text: He closes the booth up again and turns his back to the
text: gentleman who gives up and departs.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Sorry, honey. There will be no
text: further interruption.
speaker_heading: MAVIS' VOICE
dialog: Why must you always be calling me
dialog: from some booth?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: On account of that phone records
dialog: are regularly subpoenaed in divorce
dialog: proceedings. And I don't want some
dialog: entry showing up on my cellular
text: bill either. She gets the mail.
text: She looks these items over.
text: Sometimes she even dials up a
text: strange number to see who it is.
speaker_heading: MAVIS' VOICE
text: Then she suspects something.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: It's only because her last husband,
dialog: the choreographer, ran around on
dialog: her. She can't get that out of her
dialog: head. That's how she caught onto
text: him. The phone bills.
speaker_heading: MAVIS' VOICE
dialog: She hasn't developed much skill at
text: holding a man.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: You know what a self-fulfilling
dialog: prophecy is? She was so sure I was
dialog: going to find me a woman that she
dialog: finally drove me back to you. I
dialog: thought I'd feel all guilty about
dialog: it -- but I guess it hasn't kicked
dialog: in yet.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Still, I wouldn't do anything to
dialog: hurt her. Basically, Kelly's a
dialog: decent individual.
speaker_heading: MAVIS' VOICE
dialog: What about hurting me? Like last
dialog: time?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Hurt? You were glad to be rid of
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: MAVIS' VOICE
dialog: For a while I was, 'til I took
dialog: stock of what was around. You're
dialog: the lesser of many evils.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: That's about the nicest thing you
dialog: ever said.
speaker_heading: MAVIS' VOICE
dialog: I'll have it engraved.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: We've been up front with each other
dialog: from the beginning. Let's keep it
dialog: that way. How about a drink? Say
dialog: seven o'clock? The Monkey Bar?
speaker_heading: MAVIS' VOICE
dialog: Meet me in front. I don't like
text: walking in there unescorted.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Yeah, you're great enough looking
dialog: to be mistaken for one of those
dialog: thousand dollar a night girls.
speaker_heading: MAVIS' VOICE
dialog: It happens all the time lately.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: And wear that short black number I
dialog: bought you from Bendel's.
speaker_heading: MAVIS' VOICE
dialog: Again? I don't know if it's me or
dialog: that dress you like.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Have a good day. Make plenty of
dialog: tips. And leave the whole evening
dialog: open. She thinks I've got Knicks
dialog: tickets.
text: He hangs up. Then whips a tiny cellular phone out of his
text: jacket pocket, flips it open and dials. Someone answers on
text: the first ring.
speaker_heading: COLUMNIST (V.O.)
dialog: Speak!
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: (into cellular)
dialog: It's your boy Stuart. When was the
dialog: last time I called you for a favor?
speaker_heading: COLUMNIST (V.O.)
text: The column is already full.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I just need one line. Anybody you
dialog: wanna say was seen dining out at
text: Mario's Stromboli restaurant.
speaker_heading: COLUMNIST (V.O.)
dialog: Maybe you don't hear so good? I
dialog: got no space for you.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Who's asking any favors? I'm
text: offering reciprocal information.
speaker_heading: COLUMNIST (V.O.)
dialog: Since when were you ever a reliable
dialog: source?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Check it out. Tony award-winning
dialog: producer Willie Beagle tossed his
dialog: wife back into rehab again
dialog: following her third attempt at
text: diving off the terrace at their
dialog: plush eighteen room residence at
dialog: the San Remo. I got it from the
text: doorman.
speaker_heading: COLUMNIST (V.O.)
dialog: I got it from their maid yesterday.
dialog: It's in the paper today. Or don't
dialog: you bother to read my shit?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Louis, my intentions were entirely
dialog: honorable.
speaker_heading: COLUMNIST (V.O.)
dialog: I'll drop your item in sometime
dialog: next week. If you promise not to
dialog: call me for a month.
text: He hangs up. Stu looks pleased as he folds the cell phone
text: and tucks it away.
text: Then he starts to vacate the booth. The phone rings. And
text: rings. Curious, he picks up the receiver. There's a voice
text: on the other end of the line. A DISTINCTIVE MALE VOICE.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Don't even think about leaving that
dialog: booth.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Stay exactly where you are and
dialog: listen carefully.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I've got a heavy day, mister.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: You know better than to disobey me.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I don't know you at all.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Are you absolutely sure?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Who is this?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Someone who's watching you.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Get lost!
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Love the gray suit. That red and
dialog: black tie makes a nice combination.
text: Stu is taken back by the accurate description of his apparel.
text: He looks around nervously.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Where? Where are you?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Closer than you think.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I don't see you.
speaker_heading: VOICE
text: There are any number of windows.
dialog: Check them out.
text: Indeed that street corner is surrounded by high rise
text: buildings and hotels.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Okay, you had your little joke.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I'm not sufficiently amused. Not
dialog: yet. We have more to talk about.
text: Stu knows he should simply hang up but something tells him
text: not to. Perhaps it's the strange tone of the man's voice.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Do me a favor. Call up somebody
dialog: else.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: But it's you I'm interested in.
dialog: You know how many people use that
dialog: booth every day?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Why don't you tell me?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Better than two-hundred people on
dialog: average.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Is that what you do? Count them?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: What else do I have to do? It's
text: interesting watching people.
text: Trying to guess who they are. And
dialog: what they're up to.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: What are you -- a shut-in of some
dialog: kind?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: You might say that. I can't go
dialog: out. I might be seen.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Somebody's looking for you?
speaker_heading: VOICE
text: Desperately.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: The cops?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Not yet.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: The ex-wife. What'd you do -- run
dialog: out on child support?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: What kind of man do you think I am?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Frankly, I could care less. You
dialog: had your fun. Now goodbye.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: It's not in your best interests to
dialog: hang up on me. That would make me
dialog: angry.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Isn't that just too bad?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: For you.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: There's ten million names in the
dialog: phonebook. Pester somebody else.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I never talk to people I can't see.
dialog: I need to study their reactions.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Alright, bullshit artist, what am
dialog: I doing right now?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Scratching your forehead with your
dialog: left hand. Now you're brushing
dialog: your hair back.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Okay, okay, you got me in your
dialog: scrutiny. So what?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: So let's talk.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Only I got nothing to say.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Oh, you will. You'll do a lot of
dialog: talking before this conversation is
dialog: over. And it'll only end when I
dialog: want it to.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Is that a fact? Well if you watch
dialog: closely, you will see me hang up.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I don't think you will.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I interest you.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Why should I be interested in some
dialog: creep who gets his jollies spying
dialog: on strangers in phone booths?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: But you're not a stranger, Stu.
text: The sound of his own name sends a chill through him.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Who put you up to this?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: You were my very own selection.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Why me in particular?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Because you're so afraid.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Ha! What've I got to be afraid of?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Just about everything. You have so
dialog: much to hide.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: How do you figure that?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Why else would a man with a
dialog: perfectly good cellular bother to
dialog: make calls from a pay booth?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: That's my business.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I've made it mine.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: All of a sudden I'm required to
dialog: give explanations to you?
speaker_heading: VOICE
text: In explicit detail.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: What is this? Some kind of candid
dialog: camera gag? Or like that thing on
text: HBO where the cab driver is taping
dialog: what goes on in the back seat?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: This is not showbusiness, my
dialog: friend. This is reality.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Your reality. Not mine, you
dialog: lowlife fuck.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Stu, you'll be made to suffer for
dialog: your attitude, so let's dispense
dialog: with the vulgarities.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Now you're threatening me! Fuck
dialog: you. Could that be any clearer?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: You're only making it easier for me
dialog: to do you harm.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Oh yeah. Right. Can you see how
dialog: I'm trembling?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: You will be.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Shit, this is a new one. Fucking
text: threatening calls in a goddam phone
dialog: booth. When are you going to start
text: with the heavy breathing.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I'm not the degenerate. You are,
dialog: Stu.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: You don't know anything about me.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Infinitely more than you know about
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Like the number you dialed when you
text: first entered the booth.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: How would you know that?
speaker_heading: VOICE
text: I'm watching through a scope and I
dialog: could clearly read the buttons you
dialog: pushed. I have another extension
dialog: here by the window. Shall I dial
dialog: that same number back for you?
dialog: Would that convince you?
text: Stu nervously cranes his neck, looking around at all the tall
text: buildings that surround the street corner.
speaker_heading: STU'S POV
text: PANNING up at thousands of windows. The Voice could be
text: coming from anywhere.
text: BACK TO STU IN THE BOOTH
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Let's see who's on the other end of
dialog: the line.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Don't.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Too late.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It's already ringing. I'll hold
dialog: the receiver up so you can listen
dialog: in.
text: Stu can hear the beeping as the other line rings.
text: Then Mavis' voice can be heard answering. Stu listens
text: helplessly.
speaker_heading: MAVIS' VOICE
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Well, hello.
speaker_heading: MAVIS' VOICE
dialog: Who is this?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Someone who's really tight with
dialog: your boyfriend -- who just called
dialog: you from his favorite phone booth.
speaker_heading: MAVIS' VOICE
dialog: You know Stu?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Stu? Oh, I know him better than
dialog: anyone. What he does -- how he
text: thinks. How he lies.
speaker_heading: MAVIS' VOICE
dialog: Who the hell is this?
speaker_heading: VOICE
text: Stu is listening in. He knows what
dialog: we're both saying.
speaker_heading: MAVIS' VOICE
dialog: Stu? Is that true? Are you there?
speaker_heading: VOICE
text: He doesn't feel like talking.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: (shouts)
dialog: Mavis! Just hang up the goddam
dialog: phone.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: She can't hear you, Stu. Only me.
dialog: (a pause)
dialog: Mavis, I'm afraid Stu hasn't been
dialog: totally honest with you. But then
dialog: he can't be honest with anyone, can
dialog: he?
speaker_heading: MAVIS' VOICE
dialog: What's your name? To whom am I
dialog: speaking?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: You've never heard of me, Mavis.
dialog: He doesn't want you to know I
dialog: exist. He wishes I didn't exist.
dialog: But there isn't anything he can do
dialog: about that.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Still there, Stu? All you can do
dialog: is listen.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Mavis -- the guy is a fucking
dialog: nutcase! Hang the fuck up.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: She doesn't want to. She wants to
dialog: know all about us. Don't you,
dialog: Mavis?
speaker_heading: MAVIS' VOICE
dialog: Did his wife put you up to this?
dialog: That bitch, Kelly?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Oh yes, the bitch wife, Kelly. My
dialog: very next call.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: (yells)
dialog: He doesn't know my wife! Don't
dialog: tell him anything else.
text: Outside the booth, a huge, heavy-set black woman in a too
text: tight dress, now appears with the clear desire to use the
text: phone. Her name is FELICIA. She taps on the glass.
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: Could you hurry it along?
text: Stu ignores her and Felicia glares at him through the glass
text: with hostility.
dialog: Stu has no inclination to deal with anybody else. He's too
text: distracted by the madness happening over the telephone.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Can you hear me, Mavis? Keep your
text: big mouth shut.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Is that any way to talk to a woman
dialog: you love?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Mavis, is he always that abusive to
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: MAVIS' VOICE
dialog: You're getting me all upset. I
dialog: don't know who you are or how you
dialog: know all this --
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I find out things -- from watching
text: people and listening to them.
speaker_heading: MAVIS' VOICE
dialog: Just what is your relationship to
dialog: Stu? That's all I want to know.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Well, what do you think?
speaker_heading: MAVIS' VOICE
dialog: Answer me, goddam it!
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Well alright. Stu and I are --
text: longtime companions. A pair. Two
text: of a kind. Closer than close.
text: Peas in a pod. Spoons in a drawer.
speaker_heading: MAVIS' VOICE
dialog: You pervert!
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: That, too.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Don't believe a word of it. It's
dialog: all lies.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Too late, Stu. She already
dialog: believes it.
speaker_heading: MAVIS' VOICE
dialog: You can tell that scumbag never to
dialog: bother me again.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: He won't care. He'll still have
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: It's not true. I do care.
text: From outside the booth, there's a louder rapping on the
text: glass. Felicia really wants in.
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: Get done in there, mister. I got
dialog: me an important call.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Go away.
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: Shit I will! Finish up!
text: She continues to rap on the glass as Stu tries to focus on
text: the two-way phone call.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Why don't you tell me what you
dialog: think of us?
speaker_heading: MAVIS' VOICE
dialog: You're both disgusting.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: That's what he said about you.
dialog: Well, if Stu didn't have the balls
dialog: to come out and tell you the truth,
dialog: I felt it was my responsibility to
dialog: clear the air. Goodbye now, Mavis.
dialog: Thanks for your time.
dialog: (the phone clicks off; we
dialog: hear only a dial tone)
dialog: Back to you again, Stu.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: You total asshole! How could you
dialog: do that?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Speaking of females, that woman
text: hovering outside the booth -- may
dialog: as well tell her that you'll be on
dialog: the line forever.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Like hell I will.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I'm ready for you to take out your
dialog: cellular and phone home. And this
dialog: time, I'll listen in.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: There's no chance of that.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Or should I call Kelly and make up
dialog: something totally outrageous? You
dialog: must realize by now I have a vivid
dialog: imagination.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: You don't know our phone number!
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Are you absolutely sure? I may
dialog: have been watching you on a regular
dialog: basis. Keeping track of all the
dialog: numbers I see you dial.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: And I'm supposed to believe that?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I've put a great deal of
dialog: preparation into this -- prior to
dialog: actually saying hello. Now do you
dialog: want to dial 832-7165 -- or should
dialog: I?
text: The sound of the actual number being spoken shocks him even
text: more than the earlier mention of his name.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: What are you going to tell her?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: You'll do the talking.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: What am I supposed to say?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Try telling her the truth.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Look, I don't want to hurt Kelly.
dialog: She's always there for me. It's
dialog: just my nature to have a little
dialog: 'strange' on the side. It doesn't
dialog: mean shit.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: But you still find it necessary?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Kind of like having a beautiful
dialog: home. With everything you ever
dialog: dreamed of. But you still need
dialog: that vacation now and then. Some
dialog: nice hotel room with a great view.
dialog: Maybe a pool. Only you wouldn't
dialog: want to spend more than a few days
dialog: in any hotel. Eventually, you want
dialog: to go back to your home and all
dialog: your stuff. You're real glad to
dialog: check out.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Kelly is home and Mavis is a hotel?
dialog: I'm sure they'll both appreciate
dialog: that explanation.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: You're ruining my fucking life, you
dialog: sonofabitch.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Didn't I warn you about calling me
dialog: names? It makes me vindictive.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: What else can you do to me?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: We haven't even begun.
speaker_heading: STU
text: She's not home. She went out.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I'll bet she's back. Now hold the
dialog: cellular up where I can see it --
dialog: so I can be certain you don't
dialog: misdial on me.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: A little higher and to your left.
dialog: Now I have it in perfect view.
text: Dial slowly.
text: More violent rapping on the glass from the persistent black
text: lady outside.
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: If you got you a cell phone, how
dialog: come you taking up the whole
dialog: fucking booth! This here's an
dialog: emergency!
speaker_heading: STU
text: There's another booth on the next
dialog: block.
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: It's busted. Every damn phone on
dialog: Eighth Avenue is busted but this
dialog: one.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Well, I'm not through! Go in a
dialog: restaurant or someplace, but get
dialog: away from me!
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: I'm gonna pull you out of that
dialog: booth and snatch you ballheaded!
text: She tries to pull open the sliding door to the booth but Stu
text: jams it shut, right on her hand.
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: You assaulted my person.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Let me hear from your lawyer!
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: You're hear alright. I'm coming
dialog: back. And your ass better not be
dialog: around.
text: She stalks off obviously in search of assistance.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Good work, Stu. Now let me see you
dialog: dial. Tuck the receiver under your
dialog: chin and dial your remote.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I'm doing it.
text: He punches in the digits. The phone rings -- and rings.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I told you she was out.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Let it ring.
text: Then a girl's voice is heard.
speaker_heading: KELLY'S VOICE
dialog: Shepard residence.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Hold it close to the receiver so I
dialog: can hear.
speaker_heading: KELLY'S VOICE
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Honey, it's me.
speaker_heading: KELLY'S VOICE
dialog: What's taking you so long? I
dialog: thought we were having some lunch
dialog: at Mario's?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Change of plan. We're not eating
dialog: in that dump any more.
speaker_heading: KELLY'S VOICE
dialog: How come?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: The Health Department gave them a
dialog: 'C' rating -- that's how come.
dialog: Here I'm trying to put the place on
text: the map and he fucks it all up with
text: a major roach problem.
speaker_heading: KELLY'S VOICE
dialog: That's disgusting. Okay, I'll fix
dialog: us a sandwich. Where are you now?
speaker_heading: STU
text: Just in a phone booth.
speaker_heading: KELLY'S VOICE
dialog: How come? The caller ID says
dialog: you're on your cellular.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Oh yeah, I am.
speaker_heading: KELLY'S VOICE
dialog: But you're also in some phone
dialog: booth?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Explain that one, Stu.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I only stepped in because the
text: traffic was so loud outside.
speaker_heading: KELLY'S VOICE
dialog: Well just hurry on back.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Tell her you can't.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Not for a few minutes.
speaker_heading: KELLY'S VOICE
dialog: Are you sure you're alone? I hear
text: somebody in the background.
speaker_heading: STU
text: The guy in the next booth. He's
dialog: got a bad connection and he's
text: hollering his fool head off.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: You've got an answer for
dialog: everything.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I love you, baby.
speaker_heading: KELLY'S VOICE
dialog: Do you?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: You know that.
speaker_heading: KELLY'S VOICE
dialog: Stu -- who was that man?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: What man?
speaker_heading: KELLY'S VOICE
dialog: Some person who phoned fifteen
dialog: minutes ago -- just after you went
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I don't understand...
speaker_heading: KELLY'S VOICE
dialog: This total stranger rang up and
dialog: told me to wait by the phone --
dialog: because you'd be calling me in a
dialog: few minutes -- from a booth. And I
dialog: said what would he be doing in any
dialog: phone booth?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: And what did this guy say?
speaker_heading: KELLY'S VOICE
dialog: He said you'd be making phone
dialog: calls. What else?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Making calls is part of my
dialog: business.
speaker_heading: KELLY'S VOICE
dialog: To whom?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Clients. People. Planting items
dialog: like I do.
speaker_heading: KELLY'S VOICE
dialog: Women?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Once in a while one of them could
dialog: be a woman. I just called
dialog: "Elaine's" and talked to her to see
dialog: who was in there last night.
speaker_heading: KELLY'S VOICE
dialog: You know exactly what I mean.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: You're not going to start that shit
dialog: again?
speaker_heading: KELLY'S VOICE
dialog: I just feel something is wrong.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: What could be wrong?
speaker_heading: KELLY'S VOICE
dialog: The way you sound. You don't sound
dialog: like yourself.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Yeah? Who do I sound like?
speaker_heading: KELLY'S VOICE
dialog: Someone who's scared. There's fear
dialog: in your voice like I've never heard
dialog: before.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: See, Stu? Kelly agrees with me.
speaker_heading: KELLY'S VOICE
dialog: I want you to come back home. Now!
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I told you. In a while.
speaker_heading: KELLY'S VOICE
dialog: No. I want you here now. In case
dialog: he calls back, I don't want to
dialog: answer again.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Why should he call back?
speaker_heading: KELLY'S VOICE
dialog: I feel like he's going to.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: You're the one that sounds
dialog: frightened. And of nobody.
speaker_heading: KELLY'S VOICE
dialog: He's not a nobody. He knows about
dialog: us.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: You're not telling me all he said.
dialog: What are you holding back?
speaker_heading: KELLY'S VOICE
dialog: I can't discuss it on the phone.
dialog: Just get over here!
text: CLICK! She hangs up.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: (into pay phone)
dialog: Why did you do that to her? She
dialog: never did you any harm.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: How would you know? Everybody does
dialog: harm to somebody. And then they
dialog: try their best to forget it.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Maybe me -- but not her. Whatever
dialog: I've done, there's no reason to
dialog: take it out on her.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Suppose that's the only way I can
dialog: get to you? You claim you love
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Yeah, I do.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: You don't even love yourself.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: But Kelly... I would never hurt.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Still you have to uphold your
dialog: status as an honorary asshole.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Listen, I've treated all my women
dialog: decent. I never laid a hand on any
dialog: of them, even when provoked. And I
dialog: always let them down easy.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'm not ready to let Kelly go.
dialog: Maybe I never will be.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: What if she dumps you first?
dialog: What's the odds she's already taken
dialog: up with somebody? One day soon
dialog: you'll come home and find her gone
dialog: along with the CD player and the
speaker_heading: VCR.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I'm not gonna let you mind-fuck me
dialog: all day! That's it. This call is
dialog: ended.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Not until I say it is.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: What happens if I hang up?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: You don't really want to find out.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I'm dying to hear this!!! What the
dialog: fuck can you do about it -- up in
dialog: your fucking high window with your
dialog: goddam binoculars?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I never indicated I had binoculars.
dialog: I said I had a highly magnified
dialog: telescopic image of you that
dialog: brought you up so close I could see
dialog: where you nicked yourself under the
dialog: chin shaving this morning.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Oh -- while you're at it, have a
dialog: look up my ass.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I may very well do that, Stu. In
dialog: the meantime, think about what kind
text: of device has a telescopic sight
text: mounted on it.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: What? You mean... like a rifle?
speaker_heading: VOICE
text: A high-powered .30 calibre bolt
dialog: action Remington 700 with a carbon
dialog: one modification and a state of the
text: art Henzholdt tactical sniperscope.
dialog: And you're in the cross hairs, Stu.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I'm supposed to believe that?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: There's only one way I can prove it
dialog: to you. Hang up the receiver and
text: find out. At this range, the exit
dialog: wound ought to be about the size of
text: a small tangerine.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: And you're just going to kill me
dialog: for no reason?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: For plenty of reasons! Because you
dialog: hung up. For years I hated people
dialog: hanging up on me. Ex-girlfriends.
dialog: Women I didn't even know.
dialog: Prospective employers.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I get hung up on all the time. You
dialog: get used to it.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Or else you don't. I worked for
dialog: months getting people to switch to
dialog: MCI -- being insulted at and being
dialog: hung up on hundreds of times a day.
dialog: The ones that cursed me out for
dialog: invading their privacy never
dialog: bothered me as much as those that
dialog: clicked off without even bothering
dialog: to reply.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Then why didn't you go after one of
dialog: them?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Maybe you are one of them.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Hey, I have worked in a boiler room
dialog: myself peddling "Term Life." I
dialog: Would never be rude to a fellow
dialog: salesperson.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Can you feel it on you now? The
dialog: heat of it. I'm moving the strike
dialog: zone down to your stomach area.
dialog: Now I'm raising it up again.
text: Directly above the chest cavity --
text: sliding up to the forehead just
text: above the left ear.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Shit -- I do feel it.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Tell me where I'm going with it
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: STU
text: Across my forehead -- now back
dialog: where it was before.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I'm amazed how you can do that.
dialog: You're amazingly accurate.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Now I know what you're thinking.
dialog: If I drop down on the floor of the
dialog: booth and flatten myself out...
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: No, I'm not thinking that.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Oh yes you are. Can I crawl out
dialog: using the booth as a shield? Can I
dialog: crawl to that Chrysler illegally
dialog: parked only three or four feet
dialog: away? The shattering glass may cut
dialog: me, but it'll only be superficial.
dialog: Otherwise, this lunatic will never
dialog: let me out alive.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: No. You will. I know you will.
dialog: If I just cooperate.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Where is it now? Think and feel
dialog: for the warm spot.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Below the shoulder?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Which one?
speaker_heading: STU
text: The right shoulder.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Remarkable how we're in tune.
dialog: You're doing far better than the
dialog: others.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: What others? What do you mean?
dialog: (no reply)
dialog: You said 'others!'
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: (finally)
dialog: I'm sure you read about the Italian
dialog: tourist shot dead ten days ago at
dialog: the corner of Forty-fifth and
dialog: Eighth?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I saw it on the news.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: And where are we now?
speaker_heading: STU
text: Oh, God. Forty-fifth and Eighth.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: What else do you remember about
dialog: that killing?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Try.
speaker_heading: STU
text: He was gunned down. And nobody was
dialog: caught. And they didn't even
dialog: bother to take his wallet or his
dialog: watch... or anything.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Now you know why. It wasn't a
dialog: robbery.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: What did he do?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: He hung up -- so I disconnected him
dialog: permanently.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Please -- don't do it to me. You
dialog: got no reason to do it to me.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Don't give me reason.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I'm not looking to. Tell me what
dialog: you want!
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Tell me about your job.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: What's to tell? I'm in Public
dialog: Relations. They used to call us
dialog: "flacks." Now we're media
dialog: consultants.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: What do you do, exactly?
speaker_heading: STU
text: Plant items in the paper and on the
dialog: tube. More important sometimes,
dialog: keep stuff out.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: What've you kept out?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: One of my people got nailed for
dialog: indecent exposure. I managed for
dialog: the cops to use his real name
dialog: instead of his stage name so nobody
text: picked up on it.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: You saved the little deviate's ass,
dialog: didn't you?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: He's in major therapy now. I swear
dialog: he is.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: You must hang with some major
dialog: celebrities. Journalists,
dialog: newscasters -- those types.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I'm real close with Larry King.
dialog: And the "Hard Copy" people.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Could you get him down here? Larry
dialog: King?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Why would he want to come here?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Because you asked him to.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: He comes from Atlanta.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Well, who could you get?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Wolf Blitzer?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Probably not.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Regis?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Definitely no chance.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: You'd be offering them an exclusive
dialog: newsbreak. I'm talking about more
dialog: than one homicide.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: How many?
speaker_heading: VOICE
text: I don't answer questions. I ask
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I gotta have the facts. They might
dialog: not believe me. My record isn't
dialog: too good when it comes to hard
dialog: news.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: You're not considered a reliable
dialog: source?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: On a divorce or separation, maybe.
dialog: Or who's gay, or who isn't gay any
dialog: more. I kind of specialize in that
dialog: kind of material. I mean I could
dialog: probably get you Joe Franklin.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: How about Cindy Adams?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I might have a shot. Are you
dialog: familiar with Liz Smith?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Do you know her number?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Want I should call her? How much
dialog: can I say?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Tell her you're in direct touch
dialog: with a killer who's willing to
dialog: speak honestly if she shows up here
dialog: alone and without notifying the
dialog: authorities.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: She usually likes to have a
dialog: celebrity involved. If you had an
dialog: actor or a sports figure held
dialog: prisoner instead of me, there'd be
dialog: better odds she's come.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Then lie. Pick a celebrity and put
text: them in the booth.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Let's see. Who does she like? Who
dialog: couldn't be reached to deny it?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I'm anxious to see you in action.
dialog: Don't keep me waiting.
text: Stu uses his cellular again.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: (dialing)
dialog: Sometimes you only get her service.
dialog: (into cellular)
dialog: Hi -- Stu Shepard. Put me through.
dialog: I've got hard news for her. I can
dialog: only talk to her directly. But say
dialog: it regards -- Liza.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Liza? That was imaginative.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: (into cellular)
dialog: No, I can't call back. I'll have
dialog: to lay in on somebody else.
dialog: Alright, but I can't hang on long.
dialog: (to pay phone)
text: She's coming on.
dialog: (to cellular)
dialog: Liz, hello. Sure I'll make it
dialog: brief. Killing two weeks ago in
dialog: the theatre district? Turn out a
dialog: sniper did the job. Yeah, a sniper
text: with a rifle. Now he's got another
dialog: victim lined up. Not just your
text: anonymous New Yorker, but Liza.
dialog: Now you can't call anybody or Ms.
dialog: Minelli's dead meat and so am I.
text: She's hostage in a phone booth
text: right in the sniper's sights. But
dialog: he says he'll talk to you and let
dialog: her walk. I know it'll take balls
dialog: to do this, but you're a fine and
dialog: courageous newspaper woman...
text: There's a click. Silence.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Hello? Hello?
dialog: (to pay phone)
text: Either she's on her way over or she
dialog: doesn't believe me.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: You weren't particularly
dialog: convincing.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I didn't really believe in what I
dialog: was saying.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Because you don't really believe my
dialog: Remington is pointed at you?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I do.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: You're ninety percent sure.
speaker_heading: STU
text: At least ninety-five percent, easy.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Let me erase all doubt.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: No. Don't shoot.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Control yourself, Stu. Glance down
dialog: at your chest. What do you see.
speaker_heading: STU
text: Oh, my God. A dot. A fucking red
dialog: dot.
text: A tiny red dot now moves across Stu's chest.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Like you've seen in the movies?
speaker_heading: STU
text: The laser dot. Just before some
dialog: poor bastard always gets blown
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Usually a supporting player. That
dialog: lovely but by now generic special
dialog: effect of the bullet piercing the
dialog: forehead.
text: The tiny red laser dot dances around Stu's chest and stomach
text: -- the jumps up and remains between his eyes.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: This takes all the guesswork out of
dialog: it. You know exactly where to
dialog: expect it before I even tighten my
text: finger on the trigger.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Don't tighten. Don't even tickle
dialog: that fucking finger.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: How about Geraldo? He's run his
dialog: ass off to get in on this.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: You're talking about the old
dialog: Geraldo. Look, I can try and reach
dialog: cable NBC. They're hungry.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I'm disappointed. I wanted to go
dialog: first class.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: They do a great job. They'll haul
dialog: a whole crew over to cover your
dialog: surrender "live."
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I never expressed interest in
dialog: giving myself up. There are so
dialog: many other phone booths in the
dialog: city. I'm just getting warmed up.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: That's entirely up to you. Your
dialog: choice. I'm just trying to set you
text: up with the proper communicator.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I suppose Liza wasn't strong
dialog: enough. I should've said Madonna.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Now you're being creative.
text: Outside the booth, the angry black woman has returned,
text: bringing with her a gaudily dressed pimp named LEON who looks
text: like he means business. He slams his fist against the glass,
text: nearly shattering it.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Drag your baggy butt out of that
dialog: booth. We got business to conduct
text: out of there.
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: He been in there all day.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I'm not through.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Hang up that receiver or I'll make
dialog: you eat the fucking thing!
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Fuck off or I'll call a cop.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Do you see one around here? What
dialog: you think I'm gonna be doing while
dialog: you're waiting for a prowl car to
dialog: get assigned? I'm about to cut you
dialog: a second asshole if you don't
dialog: vacate those premises.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I can't.
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: He's got him a fucking cellular.
dialog: What's he need to be on our booth
dialog: for?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I can't explain it.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: I'm not interested in your
dialog: explanations even if you had any.
text: He withdraws a switchblade knife from his pocket but doesn't
dialog: open it -- yet.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: If I flick this, I use it.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I'll make it worth your while to go
dialog: away. How much do you want?
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Make me an offer.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Thirty dollars. It's all I've got
dialog: in cash. Take it and go.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: You're offering to rent my phone
dialog: booth? For how long?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I don't know. For as long as it
dialog: takes.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: What's so special in there?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Do you want the money?
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Is that a genuine Rolex you've got
dialog: on?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Come on, man. That's my good
dialog: watch.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: That's what it's gonna take.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Then here. Take the damn thing.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: And the thirty!
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Take it all.
text: The pimp pockets the watch and the money. But doesn't go
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Now I'm satisfied. But you still
dialog: got to deal with Felicia here. I
dialog: believe you spoke harshly to her.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I apologize.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: And did her some injury.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: An accident. I'm sorry about that,
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: The man don't sound like he means
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: I agree.
dialog: (to Stu)
dialog: Why don't you hang up a minute so
dialog: we can discuss this matter at
dialog: length.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: It's long distance. I can't lose
dialog: the call -- I might not get them
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Do I have to rip that fucking phone
dialog: out of there?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: That wouldn't be a good idea.
dialog: (into pay phone)
dialog: Would it?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Not at all.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I gave you everything I've got.
speaker_heading: LEON
text: That pinky ring looks attractive.
dialog: Felicia might like that.
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: It might fit.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: You want the ring, you've got the
dialog: ring. If I can get it off.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: I can get it off you.
text: Leon reaches in and grabs Stu's ring hand.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Let go of me! It's coming loose.
dialog: There.
dialog: (he tosses it)
dialog: Okay, Felicia, with my deepest
dialog: apologies. Goodbye now.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: What's really going on in that
text: booth -- that escapes the naked
dialog: eye?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Nothing. Talk. That's all.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: That your connection on the end of
dialog: the line? Or are you dealing?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: This has nothing to do with drugs.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: You gotta be high on something to
dialog: willingly divest yourself of your
dialog: valuables -- just to maintain
dialog: occupancy of a fucking phone booth
dialog: that the local bums piss in every
dialog: night.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I knew it smelled for some reason.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: You look like you're ready to piss
dialog: yourself.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Because I am.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Maybe if the city provided decent
dialog: public toilets, folks wouldn't
dialog: relieve themselves in the subway
dialog: stations and phone booths!
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I'll take it up with the mayor.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Next thing you know you're gonna
dialog: claim we mugged you -- took your
text: billfold and watch.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: No, you didn't. It was a fair and
dialog: equitable deal. You had
dialog: territorial rights to this booth
dialog: and I paid a license fee. Fair is
dialog: fair. Now leave me in peace.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: You sure you're alright?
dialog: (to Felicia)
text: He don't look well.
speaker_heading: FELICIA
text: Kind of pale. Even for a white
dialog: man.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Jaundice they calls it. Probably
dialog: advanced liver trouble.
dialog: (to Stu)
dialog: If it's cirrhosis, you better find
dialog: yourself a twelve step program and
dialog: quick.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Thanks for your interest but I'm in
dialog: perfect health.
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: So how come his hand is shaking?
speaker_heading: LEON
text: The man is cracking up.
speaker_heading: FELICIA
text: Lookit the sweat pouring off the
dialog: sonofabitch. That's one sick
dialog: mother you started up with, Leon!
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Me? You're the one that brought me
dialog: over and exposed me to all his
dialog: germs.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I'm terminal, okay? Now can I
dialog: close the booth and continue my
dialog: conversation?
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: I'm worried now it might be
dialog: catching. All that money out of
dialog: your sweaty pocket is probably
dialog: crawling with some rare and
dialog: incurable disease.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Fine. Give it back.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: What good's that? We done touched
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Well go wash your hands.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Come on now. Own up to what you're
dialog: carrying. Is it some of that
dialog: sexually transmitted shit? Cause
dialog: in that case, we can relax.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I'm sick of you. Now get out of my
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Here we's being solicitous as to
dialog: your health and you respond by
dialog: heaping abuse!
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: Whip his arrogant ass.
text: Leon reaches into the booth and grabs Stu's jacket.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Touch me and I'll throw up on you.
text: At the suggestion, Leon lets go quickly.
text: It looks like a stalemate. Stu isn't vacating the booth and
text: Leon and his lady are reluctant to touch him further. He
text: does indeed look sick.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: (into pay phone)
dialog: You can see what I'm up against
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Want me to get rid of him for you?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: What do you have in mind?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I'll think of something.
text: Suddenly the red dot reappears on the forehead of the pimp.
text: Leon doesn't realize it's there. The hooker behind him has
text: no way of seeing it. But to Stu, there's no way to miss it.
text: He reacts.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: God -- no.
dialog: (into pay phone)
dialog: Don't. It's not necessary.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: You asked for my help.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I'll handle it myself.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: You're not doing too well. I can
dialog: settle it in a fraction of a
dialog: second. Shall I demonstrate?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: No.
dialog: (to Leon)
dialog: For your own safety, mister, just
dialog: walk away.
speaker_heading: LEON
text: Now the man is turning
dialog: aggressive... issuing threats upon
dialog: my person.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: You're making this happen.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: If you don't hang up and step out,
dialog: I'm about to topple this booth into
dialog: the gutter with you inside it.
text: Reluctant to touch Stu again, Leon assaults the booth itself.
text: He begins shaking it violently -- trying to rip it from its
text: foundation. And the rickety booth is not too sturdy. It
text: starts rocking back and forth.
text: Stu is thrown around inside it, barely keeping his footing.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: (into pay phone)
dialog: This isn't my fault.
dialog: (shouts)
dialog: Stop that!
text: But Leon continues rocking the booth. It won't come loose --
text: so in frustration, he punches in a side pane of glass.
text: The glass shatters all around Stu, who does his best to
text: shield himself from the slivers.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: (into pay phone)
dialog: The guy's insane!
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Only one way to stop a mad dog.
dialog: Give me permission.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I can't.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: If he forces you out of that booth,
dialog: I've told you what to expect. You
dialog: or him, Stu.
text: Leon is smashing other panes of glass now -- one after
text: another -- as Stu cowers inside.
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: Don't cut yourself, honey.
text: A crowd of derelicts and street people are now gathering to
text: watch the out of control pimp take out his wrath on the booth
dialog: and its occupant.
speaker_heading: DERELICT
dialog: Looks like the fucker is comin'
dialog: loose.
speaker_heading: STREET PERSON
text: Shove it out into the oncoming
dialog: traffic.
speaker_heading: DERELICT
dialog: What'll you bet the bus could knock
dialog: that fifty feet?
text: The booth is being decimated but Stu hangs onto the phone.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: (into pay phone)
dialog: Hello? Hello?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: (with heavy static)
dialog: You're breaking up. We're about to
dialog: be cut off.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I can't help it!
speaker_heading: VOICE
text: That counts as a hang-up.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: No. It can't. That's not fair.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I can still make him stop. Say the
dialog: word. Can you hear me?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Yes.
text: Stu sees the red dot reappear on Leon's chest as he continues
text: to barrage the booth with punches and kicks.
text: Then Leon recoils, staggers a step backward. He doesn't
text: realize he's been shot.
text: There's been no sound of gunfire. Perhaps a silencer was
dialog: used -- or the downtown traffic drowned out the solitary
dialog: discharge.
text: Leon looks confused at first. His ladyfriend has no idea
text: he's wounded -- neither do the derelicts and street people
text: who've assembled on the corner.
text: Even Stu isn't sure -- until the blood starts oozing from the
text: wound on the pimp's chest -- staining his yellow vest.
text: He isn't assaulting the booth anymore. He's trying to keep
text: his balance. He slumps forward, hanging onto the booth for
text: support -- only a few inches from Stu's face. The blood runs
text: down the side of the booth.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: (into pay phone)
dialog: You did it!
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: You said 'yes.'
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I said 'Yes, I can hear you.' Not
dialog: 'Yes -- kill the motherfucker!'
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Don't try to renege on it. I was
dialog: following orders.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: You're twisting it all around. I
dialog: didn't do this!
text: Meanwhile, Leon leans upright against the booth. Then his
text: legs cave in and he begins to slide to his knees.
text: Felicia runs up beside him. She sees the blood.
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: I warned you not to cut yourself.
dialog: (to crowd)
dialog: Look at all that blood. He must've
text: hit an artery.
text: She screams as Leon topples backwards onto the pavement. Now
text: his chest wound is evident.
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: Oh, Jesus. What is that? Talk to
dialog: me! What happened?
text: The crowd tightens around the fallen body. Street people who
text: are fascinated but not shocked.
speaker_heading: DERELICT
dialog: Gunshot!
speaker_heading: STREET PERSON
dialog: Yeah. Sucking chest wound right
text: over the heart.
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: Somebody call an ambulance.
speaker_heading: STREET PERSON
dialog: Call the meatwagon. He's fucked
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: You shut the fuck up!
text: Her focus turns to Stu in the battered phone booth.
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: Why did you do that to him?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I didn't.
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: (to crowd)
dialog: You all saw it! He shot my man
dialog: without no provocation!
speaker_heading: DERELICT
dialog: Yeah. Pumped one right into him at
text: close range.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: How could I? I don't even have a
dialog: gun. Look!
speaker_heading: STREET PERSON
dialog: Everybody get the fuck back! They
dialog: shoot one -- then they shoot
dialog: everybody in sight! Kill all the
dialog: fucking witnesses!
text: The crowd disperses to doorways and around the corner -- out
dialog: of immediate range.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Come back. You've got to see --
dialog: I'm not armed.
text: Only Felicia remains, leaning over the pimp's body, staring
text: helplessly.
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: Hang up and dial 911. Get a
dialog: doctor!
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I can't hang up. That's what this
dialog: is all about.
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: You're gonna stand there and let
dialog: him die?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: (takes out cellular)
dialog: I can use this.
dialog: (he dials)
dialog: Emergency. Yes. There's been a
dialog: shooting at Forty-fifth and Eighth
text: -- on the corner. A man is down.
dialog: What's the difference who I am? I
dialog: don't want to be involved.
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: (shouts)
dialog: That's bullshit. He's the shooter.
dialog: You're talking to the shooter.
text: Stu quickly disconnects the cellular.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: That wasn't nice.
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: Go ahead -- make a fucking run for
dialog: it. I hope they gun you down --
dialog: like you did him!
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I'm not going anyplace. I'm
dialog: staying right here in this booth.
dialog: (into pay phone)
dialog: Unless you give me permission.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: You're attracting a lot of
dialog: attention. I suppose when the
dialog: police get there, you'll accuse me.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: What do you expect me to say?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: That's up to you. But any mention
dialog: of me will not be appreciated.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: You mean...?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: You won't even get to finish your
dialog: sentence. Oh look, that little red
dialog: dot is dancing around all over you
dialog: again. You saw how quickly it can
dialog: happen. And how accurate I can be.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: They can't blame me -- I'm not
dialog: armed.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Who's going to believe that? With
dialog: all those witnesses to the
dialog: contrary.
speaker_heading: STU
text: They can see with their own eyes.
text: Not far away, we hear the BLAST of POLICE SIRENS drawing
dialog: closer.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Remember to leave me out of it.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: How can I?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: You'll put the proper spin on it.
dialog: Isn't that your specialty? Feeding
dialog: the public a story that may not
dialog: have a shred of truth -- and making
dialog: it totally believable?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: This isn't a story. This is real.
dialog: This is murder.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: If you'd only dealt with the man
dialog: reasonably, shown him some respect,
dialog: this might not have been necessary.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I gave him my money, my watch...
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: But not your respect. Which is
dialog: what he required of you.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: He was a fucking thief.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: And now he's a fucking dead thief.
dialog: Do you feel better about that?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I don't feel a bit guilty. This is
dialog: all your doing!
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Now you're being disrespectful of
dialog: me. You never learn. Your job is
dialog: to deal with people -- but you're
dialog: not good at it.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Hey, I'm not taking any more
dialog: criticism from some lunatic sniper
dialog: who gets his kicks killing
dialog: strangers.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: You keep insisting I'm a stranger.
dialog: Probably because you don't
dialog: recognize the voice. But there are
dialog: cheap electronic devices available
dialog: that disguise the voice. I might
dialog: not even be a man. I might be one
dialog: of those many women you've almost
dialog: totally forgotten. One who doesn't
dialog: forgive easily. One who wants to
dialog: watch you squirm.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: You're a man. I know you're a man.
dialog: Women don't kill with telescopic
dialog: rifles. They stab you.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: You sound so sure of that. But
dialog: you've never provoked any man as
dialog: much as have the women in your
dialog: life. And so many of them, Stu.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Do you even remember their names?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I've got no time to rehash my whole
dialog: life. Oh my God! The cops are
dialog: here.
text: Police cars are pulling up on all sides of Eighth Avenue.
text: Traffic has suddenly been shut down. Prowl cars have now
dialog: blocked the streets.
text: PRODUCTION NOTE: Everything is seen from Stu's perspective
text: without intercuts.
text: Half a dozen cops now emerge and approach with drawn guns.
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: (pointing)
text: That's him -- in the booth. He's
dialog: got a gun!
text: As she hurls accusations, she's lugging Leon's lifeless body
text: out into the gutter into the center of Eighth Avenue.
text: It's a bright afternoon. In the distance, we hear the
text: maddening HONKING of uptown traffic that is now being
text: rerouted, creating a huge bottleneck and raising the anger of
text: irate motorists and bus drivers whose horns provide their
text: simplest form of protest. It's a discordant concert that
text: echoes the confusion and frustration which Stu now feels...
text: As the cops surround the booth -- at a distance.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: (into bullhorn)
dialog: Throw down your weapon and come out
dialog: with your hands raised.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: They're ordering me to come out.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I can see that. Ignore them.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: What if they open fire?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: They probably won't. Look across
text: on the east side of the street. Do
dialog: you see the tourist with the home
dialog: video camera?
speaker_heading: STU'S POV
text: A distant crowd gathering on the opposite west side corner
text: behind the police cars. Some tourist is capturing the event
text: on video.
dialog: BACK TO STU
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: What about him?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: He's going to keep the police on
dialog: their best behavior. So long as
dialog: you don't take what could be
dialog: interpreted as hostile action,
dialog: you'll be safe.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: You call this safe? Six cops with
dialog: guns pointed my way?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: You want me to reduce them to three
dialog: -- or two?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Absolutely no more shooting. Now
dialog: is that clear?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: You can always change your mind.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: (with bullhorn)
dialog: You know the drill. Hands clasped
dialog: behind the back of your neck --
text: moving slowly -- step out of the
dialog: booth. If we see any sign of a
dialog: weapon, we will respond.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: (shouts)
dialog: You won't, because there isn't any.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: (bullhorn)
dialog: I repeat. Raise your hands.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I can't. I'm on a phone call.
text: Now a black POLICE CAPTAIN arrives and takes full command of
dialog: the situation.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN RAMEY
dialog: You have thirty seconds to comply.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I told you. I'm busy. Come back
dialog: later.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Very good, Stu.
text: The cops take cover behind parked cars, keeping Stu clearly
text: in their sights. He has no place to hide. He's in the
text: battered phone booth in plain view from all sides.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: You've been given an order.
text: The Sergeant slides up beside the Captain to confer.
text: PRODUCTION NOTE: We remain in LONG SHOT of the cops -- always
text: from Stu's POV. But we can hear their voices and all that is
text: said as if they were in close up. It has an odd, unreal and
dialog: distancing effect.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: We're dealing with a mental case.
dialog: He's looking for us to kill him.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: Well he's not getting his wish.
text: In the center of the street, an ambulance pulls up and a team
text: of medics jump out. They rush to Leon's body. (Again we
text: hear their voices close, even though visually they are far
dialog: off.)
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: Tell me he's gonna be alright.
speaker_heading: MEDIC
dialog: Step aside. Let us look at him.
text: The medics push her aside -- then examine the victim. He's
speaker_heading: DOA.
speaker_heading: MEDIC
dialog: Nothing we can do. Don't touch the
dialog: body. They'll need it to mark the
text: crime scene.
text: Far across the street, the Captain confers with his
text: subordinates. They are small figures on the screen but we
text: hear them sharply.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: Same corner as two weeks ago.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: Maybe it's more than a coincidence.
dialog: Cover me. I need to talk to him.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: You've got your vest on?
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: What do you think?
text: The Captain steps out of cover and boldly approaches the
text: phone booth. He stops cautiously about fifteen feet away.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: I'm not armed.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Neither am I.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: Yeah, sure. I need to know what
dialog: happened.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Can't talk about it.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: Sure you can. My name's Ramey.
dialog: Captain Ed Ramey. What's yours?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Look, I don't want to be friends.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: You look like you need a friend.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Tell him you've already got a
dialog: friend.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: (yells)
dialog: I've got a friend, okay.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: Is that who you're talking to on
dialog: the phone?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: None of your business.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
text: When somebody gets shot, it becomes
dialog: my business. Let's not have
dialog: anybody else killed. I want to
dialog: hear your side of it.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I've got no side of it.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Don't worry, Stu. I've got him
dialog: fixed right in my sights. I won't
dialog: let him hurt you.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: Has this happened to you before?
dialog: The need to hurt someone? To put a
dialog: bullet in them?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: You won't believe anything I say.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: Try me.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I couldn't shoot anybody. I'm not
dialog: armed.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: You're right. I don't believe you.
dialog: What's that bulge in your pants
dialog: pocket?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: That? That's my cellular.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: A cellular? Then what are you
text: doing in a phone booth making
dialog: calls?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Do you want to see it?
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: Don't reach for it, mister.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Then how can I show it to you?
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: I don't need to see it. I know
dialog: what's there. All these witnesses
dialog: saw you use it on him.
text: From behind a parked car, a HOMELESS PERSON calls out.
speaker_heading: STREET PERSON
dialog: (hollers)
dialog: Damn straight!
text: Another DERELICT, crouched in a doorway, joins in.
speaker_heading: DERELICT
dialog: (shouts)
dialog: Yeah! Shot him down like a dog!
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: They're all lying. Nobody saw it
dialog: because it didn't happen.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
text: A man is dead but it didn't happen.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Not on account of me! This is like
dialog: some bad dream.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: You're walking through a bad dream
dialog: and you can't wake up. Do you want
dialog: to wake up?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I'm trying.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: And in this dream, you killed that
dialog: man. He was bothering you so you
text: iced him.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: Then who did?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Don't tell him, Stu. Or it'll be
text: the last thing he ever hears. His
dialog: blood will be on your hands.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: (to Ramey)
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: But you saw it happen?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: You were the closest one to him.
dialog: You must've seen who did it.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: We're trying to be honest with each
dialog: other, aren't we?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Not necessarily.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I'm losing patience with this cop.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: I'm handling this.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: Who do you keep talking to on the
dialog: phone?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Nobody. My psychiatrist.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Excellent, Stu. You're getting
dialog: good at this.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: What's this doctor's name? It's
dialog: important we know.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: He says not to tell you. It's
dialog: privileged information.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Damn good reply. Now you're having
dialog: fun. Admit it.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Whatever you say.
speaker_heading: VOICE
text: Playing it so close to the edge.
dialog: I'll bet you've never felt so
dialog: alive. That's how I feel when I
dialog: look through the sight and select
dialog: somebody.
text: The Captain begins advancing a few steps closer.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: I respect your right to privacy.
dialog: I've been to therapy myself. The
dialog: department provides it. I know
dialog: it's not good form for a cop to be
dialog: admitting that, but...
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Tell him not to come any closer.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Stop right there. Back up a few
dialog: steps. Back where you were.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: If it makes you more comfortable.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Tell him to read you your rights.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I want you to read me my rights and
dialog: stop asking questions.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: Al least tell me your first name.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: It's my right not to have any name.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: No gun and no name. You're a
dialog: highly underprivileged person.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Demand a lawyer.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: And get me a lawyer, too. I want a
dialog: lawyer brought down here to
dialog: negotiate my surrender.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Brilliant, Stu. Keep winging it.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: It'll be hard to find a lawyer
dialog: willing to risk his life. But if
dialog: you hand over the gun...
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: How can I when you won't let me
dialog: take it out?
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: We'll take it out for you -- as
dialog: soon as you exit the booth with
dialog: your hands raised and...
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: (interrupts)
dialog: Now we're back to that again. It's
dialog: always "Get out of the booth.'
dialog: 'You can't stay in the booth.'
dialog: Well, I like it in the fucking
dialog: booth. It's my whole world now.
dialog: It's my booth and I'm never coming
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: We're not about to force you
dialog: because there could be a
dialog: miscalculation and then we'd never
dialog: find out why this happened.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Why is it so important to know?
dialog: The guy is dead. Isn't that
dialog: enough? Knowing isn't going to
dialog: make him alive again. So who gives
dialog: a fuck!
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: It's what makes the job
dialog: interesting. Finding out why.
dialog: Something drove you to do this.
dialog: You didn't go out today expecting
dialog: this to happen. It was a nice day.
dialog: You were out for a walk. And then
dialog: suddenly it all changed.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: All I wanted was to make a phone
dialog: call. One lousy phone call for
dialog: thirty-five fucking cents.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Careful, Stu. Don't volunteer too
dialog: much.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: You got some bad news on that call.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: The worst.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: Something that pushed you over the
dialog: edge?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: And I've been falling ever since.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: Time to land.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: When you hit bottom, you die.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: I'm your safety net.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: If I tell you what you want to know
dialog: -- you'll die, too.
text: Something about the implied threat sends a chill through
dialog: Captain Ramey.
speaker_heading: INSERT SHOT
text: The Captain's head as seen through a telescopic sight.
text: Ramey could be dead in an instant.
text: PRODUCTION NOTE: The only time we deviate from Stu's
text: perspective is when we see the sniper's POV through his
dialog: scope.
text: ANGLE BACK ON STU IN THE BOOTH,
text: the detective fifteen feet away.
text: Ramey decides to back off momentarily.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: I'll go see about that lawyer.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Now that's a good idea.
text: The Captain withdraws back across the street.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: He's lucky. I had him centered in
dialog: my cross hairs. I really had to
dialog: restrain myself.
text: We hear the approach of a helicopter.
text: Stu peers up ward as not one but two choppers appear above
text: the tall buildings.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: It's not the police. It's the
dialog: media. You're news, Stuart.
text: The helicopters circle above.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: You've never gotten this much press
dialog: for any of your clients. I'm
dialog: making you a famous person.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: They're just hoping for coverage of
dialog: me dying in the gutter.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Their presence is putting the
dialog: police on their continued best
dialog: behavior.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Those cops are just looking for any
dialog: excuse.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Then don't give them one.
text: Then, as if on cue, Stu's cellular phone in his pocket starts
dialog: ringing.
text: But he can't allows himself to reach for it. To do so might
text: cause the police to believe he was trying to draw his gun.
text: It rings quietly -- virtually inaudible outside the booth.
text: Drowned out by the traffic horns, the static from the police
text: radios and the newly introduced sound of television
text: helicopters circling over Eighth Avenue taking video coverage
dialog: of the event below.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Who could it be?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Kelly. She was worried about me.
text: Stu is afraid to reach in his pocket lest the cops think he's
text: going for a gun.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Maybe she's seen this on
dialog: television. It must be on every
text: channel by now. Breaking news.
speaker_heading: STU
text: She doesn't watch daytime TV.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: One of the neighbors could've
dialog: alerted her.
text: The cell phone keeps ringing, almost drowned out by the sound
text: of helicopters circling overhead.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Why are you saying this? You want
dialog: me to reach in my pocket so you can
dialog: see them open fire?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: That's an unwarranted accusation
dialog: and very unbecoming in light of the
dialog: good advice I've given in the past.
dialog: Have I ever steered you wrong?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: God -- how I'd love to hear her
dialog: voice.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: It might even be worth it. She's
dialog: insistent, isn't she?
text: The cellular won't stop ringing.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: If she knows I'm in trouble, she
dialog: won't give up.
speaker_heading: VOICE
text: Probably glued to the TV by now.
dialog: I'm watching coverage on two
text: stations now. Channel surfing.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Well, there you are on two and four
dialog: and five. Not any decent angles on
dialog: you, though, stuck inside there.
text: The cell phone continues beeping until the sound of it is
text: maddening. Stu is still afraid to reach for it and provide
text: the cops with an excuse to open fire.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: But if you'd take one or two steps
dialog: outside and look up, I think they
dialog: could get a clear picture of you.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: You said I'm not allowed to leave
dialog: the booth.
text: Finally the cell phone stops ringing.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I might be willing to bend the
dialog: rules and let you enjoy your moment
text: of fame. Set the phone down
dialog: without hanging up... and take a
dialog: step or two outside. Just for a
dialog: minute. Then come straight back in
dialog: or I'll be forced to provide 'live'
dialog: coverage that should rival the
text: historic Zapruder footage.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Nothing like an exploding head to
text: excite viewer interest.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: No, thanks. I'll stay where I am.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: It was only a suggestion. Since
dialog: you're convinced I'm going to plug
dialog: you anyway, it can't matter much.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: If you shoot me, you give yourself
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Even without a muffler, they'd
dialog: never hear the report with all this
dialog: noise. Afterwards, it'd take them
dialog: a good ten minutes to realize you
dialog: weren't plugged by some overzealous
dialog: officer. Then they'll blame the
dialog: media for inciting a crackpot
dialog: vigilante to come down here and do
text: the SWAT team's job for them.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: You expected them to come. You had
dialog: this all worked out.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I write the scenario and you all
dialog: play your parts -- as directed.
text: The damned cell phone starts beeping again. Stu fights the
text: temptation to grab for it and hear Kelly's voice for one last
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Poor Kelly. What she must be going
dialog: through.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Why don't you tell her how you feel
dialog: about her?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I'd never get the words out. Not
dialog: with fifteen or twenty rounds in
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: You can't be certain they'd fire.
dialog: They'd see it was only a phone.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: They wouldn't wait to see.
text: The cellular ringing continues jangling Stu's nerves.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Why doesn't she hang up?
text: Then Stu notices something in the crowd gathering far across
text: the street behind the police barricades. Countless faces
text: rubbernecking, probably hoping to see some display of
text: violence that would end with him face down dead on the
dialog: pavement.
text: And in the midst of them -- one face familiar to him. A
text: female, quite pretty... even in tears. It's Kelly. (We see
text: her only in LONG SHOT -- a distant figure in bright green
text: jacket that makes her stand out from the crowd.)
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: It's her! She's not calling me.
text: She's over there.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Is she?
speaker_heading: STU
text: The blonde girl in the green
dialog: jacket.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Can't miss her. Very attractive,
dialog: isn't she?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: She must've heard all the commotion
dialog: and come downstairs.
text: The cellular is still ringing.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: It's somebody else who knows my
dialog: cell number.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It's you!
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: You continue to impress.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Why is it so important that they
dialog: kill me?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Because that's how I win.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: This time you won't. If you want
dialog: me dead, you'll have to do it
dialog: yourself.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Either way I can't lose.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: It's all a game to you -- because
dialog: you're incapable of feelings.
dialog: You're not even human.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I pride myself on that. What's so
dialog: great about being human? It's the
dialog: lowest form of life on this planet
dialog: and I've taken it upon myself to
dialog: thin the herd.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I quit. I'm not answering back any
dialog: more. I won't hang up but I'm not
dialog: playing.
text: There's silence now between them.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Stu? Stu, don't be that way.
dialog: You're taking the pleasure out of
dialog: it.
text: Stu doesn't take the bait. He remains absolutely silent.
text: A stalemate has been reached.
text: WE RACK FOCUS ACROSS THE STREET TO THE POLICE
text: clustered behind an emergency vehicle. The Sergeant brings a
text: civilian to meet Captain Ramey of the SWAT unit. The
text: newcomer wears coveralls stenciled "AT&amp;T." (Although they
text: are very far away, we hear their voices close up as they come
dialog: into sharper focus.)
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: This here's Helfand, of New York
dialog: Telephone.
speaker_heading: HELFAND
dialog: Glad to help out.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: Have you got the number of that
dialog: booth?
speaker_heading: HELFAND
dialog: Sure do.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: Can you tap into that call?
speaker_heading: HELFAND
dialog: It can be done.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: But not without a warrant. You
dialog: could be violating this psycho's
dialog: civil rights. Especially if he's
text: on the line with his fucking
dialog: psychiatrist.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: Shit. I don't want to blow this on
text: a technicality. Tracing the call
dialog: isn't any violation, is it?
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: As long as we don't listen in.
text: We remain in LONG SHOT of the POLICE as they continue in
text: heated conversation.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: (to Helfand)
dialog: Okay, we've got to know who he's
dialog: talking to and their current
dialog: location.
speaker_heading: HELFAND
dialog: That I can handle. As long as they
dialog: keep the circuit open.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: I need the number and an address to
dialog: go with it.
text: Helfand rushes off. At the corner, we can glimpse him
text: entering a phone company utility truck parked on Forty-Fifth
dialog: Street.
text: RACK FOCUS BACK TO PHONE BOOTH
text: Stu remains tight lipped and silent, refusing to give his
text: tormentor the conversation he so craves.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Stuart, my friend. Do you want to
dialog: see how close I can come without
dialog: actually hitting you?
text: Stu resists pleading because he knows his silence is more
dialog: powerful.
text: There's no glass in the left side of the booth since the late
dialog: Leon smashed it all out.
text: Nothing to shatter when the sniper squeezes off his shot.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: May I call attention to the yellow
dialog: pages?
text: The frayed yellow phonebook dangling from a chain under the
text: telephone shudders under the impact of a direct hit.
text: There's been no sound of a gunshot, but the damage is there
dialog: to behold.
text: Stu reaches for the phonebook.
text: There's a bullet hole straight through it. Pieces of the .30
text: calibre slug have shattered into many tiny fragments and are
text: imbedded between the pages, half-way through the thick
dialog: volume.
text: Stu pries pieces out of the pages of the directory. He looks
text: at them in the palm of his hand.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Hollow points are designed to break
dialog: up on impact. It would've behaved
dialog: differently if it had pierced your
dialog: soft flesh. The pieces would've
dialog: bounced around looking for a way
dialog: out. That's where the real damage
dialog: occurs -- finding an exit --
dialog: deflecting off all that bone...
text: Stu wants to shout "STOP," but restrains himself. Not
text: talking gives him some degree of power.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Still the silent treatment? My
dialog: father used to dish that out when
dialog: he chose to punish me. Not a word
dialog: spoken -- one time for over a
dialog: month. I'd try and goad him to
dialog: acknowledge I existed, but he
dialog: stared right through me. You're
dialog: bringing back unhappy childhood,
dialog: Stu. That's not wise.
text: Stu still declines to answer. His silence seems his only
text: weapon. He tosses the bullet fragments out of the booth onto
dialog: the pavement.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Since you're ignoring me, I'll
text: focus on someone else.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: There she is -- nice and sharp. I
text: can see the two little punctures in
dialog: each earlobe and my God, what kind
dialog: of a girl would have her nostril
dialog: pierced?
text: Stu realizes the sniper now has Kelly in his sights.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: What was that? Louder, Stu. We
dialog: must have a bad connection.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Leave her out of it.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I didn't expect her to show up
dialog: here. But since she has -- I'll
dialog: improvise.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Don't. Please don't. I'm sorry.
dialog: I'm talking to you again. I'll
dialog: talk all you want!
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: It's a bad dye job. The black
text: roots are growing in and it makes
text: her look cheap.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I've screwed up her life enough
dialog: already. Please don't hurt her.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I don't necessarily have to kill
dialog: her. I could be persuaded to
dialog: settle for a reasonable mutilation.
dialog: Which part of her displeases you
dialog: most? If she turns a bit more in
dialog: profile, I'm accurate enough to
dialog: remove the tip of her unpleasantly
text: protruding nose. It's just
dialog: cartilage. Any decent cosmetic
dialog: surgeon will have her looking
dialog: better than ever.
scene_heading: STU'S POV - FOCUS SHIFTS TO KELLY
text: in the crowd. Distant yet distinct amongst the curious
text: onlookers.
speaker_heading: JUMP CUT
scene_heading: CLOSER ON KELLY -- OBLIVIOUS TO HER DANGER.
text: AS SEEN THROUGH CROSS HAIRS OF TELESCOPIC SIGHT
text: following her as she forces her way through the crowd toward
text: the police officers.
text: Her face virtually fills the screen.
dialog: PRODUCTION NOTE: The only time we deviate from Stu and his
text: POV is when we see the sniper's own POV through his
text: telescopic sight.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: You can see her talking to the
dialog: police now. She's identifying
dialog: herself as your wife. They're very
dialog: interested in who you are. They're
text: taking her over to see the officer
dialog: in charge. What was his name?
speaker_heading: SNIPER'S POV
text: Through the cross hairs of the sniperscope, we can see Kelly
text: conversing with Captain Ramey. She's in a state of complete
dialog: agitation.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON STU
text: half leaning out of the booth, staring at his wife and the
text: cops in the distance.
scene_heading: RACK FOCUS TO THEM --
text: and suddenly we can hear them clearly in spite of the
dialog: distance.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: What do you mean psychiatrist? He
dialog: doesn't see any psychiatrist.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: Then who'd your husband be talking
dialog: to?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: There was some guy that called the
dialog: house this morning and said weird
dialog: stuff to me.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
text: Stu seems to be checking things out
dialog: with this person.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: He hasn't got many friends -- I can
dialog: tell you that.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: Remain here, please. We may need
dialog: you later.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: You won't hurt him?
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: We'll do our best not to.
text: Kelly is left alone as the Captain returns to their command
dialog: center.
text: Kelly is once again a solitary target. She could be picked
text: off without attracting undue attention.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: She won't even feel it when it
dialog: happens.
text: BACK TO PHONE BOOTH
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Take me instead.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Don't distract me. Now's the time
dialog: to be absolutely still. I have to
text: hold my breath as I squeeze
dialog: gently --
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: No! I'm hanging up. That's it.
text: Stu hangs up the receiver. He disconnects.
scene_heading: RACK FOCUS TO LONG SHOT --
text: The police as they react. We see a flurry of activity across
text: the street. Voices become clear as focus shifts.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
text: Shit. He hung up.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: Maybe they already traced it.
dialog: Anyhow, it doesn't matter. Looks
text: like he's coming out.
scene_heading: RACK FOCUS BACK TO STU --
text: slowly stepping out of the booth. His hands are raised.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: (shouts)
dialog: I've giving myself up. Take me!
speaker_heading: SWAT OFFICER
dialog: (distant)
dialog: First the gun. We want to see you
dialog: toss away your weapon!
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Shit. I can't.
speaker_heading: SWAT OFFICER
dialog: (distant)
dialog: Freeze where you are! Turn around
dialog: and keep those hands clasped.
dialog: (signals the others)
dialog: Take him.
text: The SWAT OFFICERS in protective gear now step out of cover
text: and fan out as they approach the booth.
scene_heading: TIGHTER ON STU
text: He's just outside the booth -- expecting to feel the sniper's
text: bullet go through him at any moment.
text: Then the pay phone starts ringing.
text: The sniper is calling back.
speaker_heading: RACK FOCUS AGAIN
dialog: to the police.
text: All the cops react. Particularly the Captain and the
text: Sergeant. Their voices seem close up when they sharpen in
dialog: focus.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: What is going on with these fucking
dialog: phone calls?
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: (shouts)
dialog: Hold your fire. Let him answer it.
text: The SWAT team backs up but maintain their aim.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: Are you nuts?
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: Let them talk. He's not going
dialog: anywhere.
dialog: (shouts)
text: He's going back inside the booth.
text: Indeed we see Stu re-enter the battered phone booth and pick
text: up the receiver.
text: FOCUS RETURNS TO STU
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: (into pay phone)
dialog: Yeah?
text: A strange voice begins chattering away in Spanish. Totally
text: unintelligible to Stu.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: (into pay phone)
dialog: You got the wrong number. Hang up.
text: The voice, probably a Puerto Rican gentleman, rattles on in
dialog: Spanish.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Wrong number. Wrong number.
text: Then the voice on the phone suddenly alters the Hispanic
text: accent. It is the now familiar tone of his tormentor.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Aw, relax, Stu. Only yanking your
dialog: chain. Now can we start over?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Those cops won't wait much longer.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: What else can they do? They can't
dialog: afford to just shoot you like I
dialog: can. Not with so much media
dialog: coverage. Not unless you make some
dialog: stupid aggressive move.
dialog: (beat)
text: The ABC Mobile Unit just rolled up.
text: Across the street, Stu can see various TV units from local
text: stations setting up cameras on roofs of trucks.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Will you look at that? I must be
dialog: going out over the network. Bet
dialog: they're pre-empting usual
dialog: programming.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: And just think -- if you survive
dialog: this, your trial will be televised.
dialog: And you can try and make the world
dialog: believe I ever existed. I'd be
dialog: your only defense.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: How are they gonna prove that I
dialog: killed anybody when there's no gun?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: They'll plant one. The police
dialog: aren't above that -- when they're
text: desperate to convict.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: No, sir. No gun and I walk.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Don't you think I took that into
dialog: account? Am I a fool?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Haven't I considered every
dialog: eventuality? I knew they'd come
text: and cordon off the block.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And that there'd have to be a gun
dialog: someplace.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: It's a small booth, Stu. Have you
dialog: checked every inch of it?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: (looking up and down)
text: It's not on the floor.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Then what's left?
speaker_heading: STU
text: Up above.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Could be. Why don't you reach up
dialog: there and lift the plastic sheet --
dialog: and feel around.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: If they see me reach for something,
dialog: they could open fire.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: They could. But you have to know
dialog: if it's there. Don't you?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I totally don't give a shit.
speaker_heading: VOICE
text: In a narrow space, tucked just to
text: the left of the fluorescent bulb.
dialog: You can almost see it outlined if
dialog: you look closely.
text: Stu peers upward at the clouded plastic, now stained and
text: dirty. There are shadows of objects above in the shallows
text: area around the light fixture that automatically goes on when
text: the door to the phone booth is tightly closed.
text: Stu opens and closes the door a few times, watching the light
text: click on -- watching the shadows around the light.
text: Could that be an accumulation of dirt, dust, or dead insects?
dialog: Or could something be stashed up there?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: It doesn't matter. I know about
dialog: ballistics. The slug in that dead
dialog: guy came from your rifle, not any
text: handgun.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: You saw how hollow points splinter
dialog: on impact. There's nothing much
dialog: for ballistics to match to. The
dialog: same make .30 calibre bullets are
dialog: in that handgun. The prosecution
dialog: rests.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: There's no gun up there. I don't
dialog: see a damn thing.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Slide your finger up under the
dialog: plastic and you'll feel the cold
text: metal surface. There are four
dialog: rounds left in it. Should you
dialog: decide to shoot your way out.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I could never shoot anybody.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: You could shoot me, Stu. You'd do
dialog: that in a minute if you could.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: And I'd fucking love it!
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Now you're speaking from the heart.
dialog: Come on, just lift the partition a
dialog: few inches and feel what's there
dialog: for you.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I'm not getting my fingerprints on
dialog: your fucking weapon. What about
dialog: powder residue? How are they going
dialog: to explain that to a jury?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Do you think that'll matter with so
dialog: many eye witnesses?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Do it... or should I re-focus my
dialog: attention on Kelly?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: You carefully distracted me from
dialog: her before and I let you get away
dialog: with it. But if you're not going
dialog: to play fairly --
dialog: (a pause)
dialog: There she is again. So close I
dialog: feel like I could touch her.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Get off her!
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Then mind me when I speak.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Look! I'm reaching up with my left
dialog: hand. I'm pushing against the
dialog: partition. It's giving. I'm
text: feeling around with my fingertips.
dialog: It's filthy up there.
scene_heading: TIGHT SHOT - STU'S FINGERS
text: feel about inside the shallow space. The shriveled remains
text: of dead flies -- a layer of dust -- and then a .30 handgun.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I'm -- touching something.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: One of the finest handguns
dialog: Remington makes. Lightweight,
dialog: efficient and highly accurate.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I'm not picking it up.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Not right now. But eventually...
text: Stu lowers his hand, still empty.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I wouldn't have a chance.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I never said you would.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I'm not insane.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: But you're getting there. It
dialog: wouldn't take much.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: That won't happen.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: You could pull the gun down, shove
dialog: it in your own mouth and jerk the
dialog: trigger. That's another option.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Why would I do that?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: To please me. And ensure that
dialog: nothing happens to Kelly. I don't
dialog: necessarily have to deal with her
text: today in the midst of a crowd of
dialog: cops. I can take her out any time
dialog: I like. When she goes to pull down
dialog: her blinds at night or when she
dialog: walks the dog first thing in the
dialog: morning. What is it -- a Jack
dialog: Russell?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Okay. I know you can do it. But
dialog: don't talk about that. Please.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I'd rather see you remembered as
text: the gallant gunman who tried to
text: shoot his way past an army of
dialog: police -- than as a coward who
dialog: sucked the barrel. I'm doing your
dialog: PR for you. Creating a final image
dialog: that'll endure. The outraged New
dialog: Yorker who was pushed too far.
dialog: When some lowlife street person
text: tries to invade his territory, he
dialog: retaliated. And when the forces of
dialog: the law closed in, he was
text: defiant... to the end.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Like that nerdy sonofabitch who
dialog: blew those three wiseass kids away
dialog: on the subway?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Exactly. Nobody minded that he was
text: a sicko. He was living out a New
dialog: Yorker's pet fantasy. Can you
dialog: remember that movie where Peter
dialog: Finch started screaming 'I'm not
dialog: taking it anymore!' And everybody
text: picked up on it.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: 'I'm mad as hell and I'm not taking
dialog: it anymore.'
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: That was it. Poor Finch got
dialog: himself an Oscar for that. But he
dialog: was dead by then. I mean he really
dialog: died. Maybe playing that part took
dialog: too much out of him.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: (softly to himself)
dialog: 'I'm not taking it anymore.' 'I'm
dialog: not taking it anymore.'
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: That's the way! Psyche yourself
text: up. Everybody respects a man who
text: fights back, even if he goes a
text: little berserk in the process.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Fighting back. That's what it's
dialog: about.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Exactly! We all understand the
text: poor schmuck that gets laid off and
text: comes back and shoots all his
dialog: bosses. We all thought of doing
dialog: that. But only he had the balls.
text: The terminally ill husband who gets
dialog: his policy canceled and machine
text: guns the insurance company offices.
dialog: Maybe somebody will finally get the
dialog: message. You can fuck human beings
dialog: over only for so long before they
dialog: come back at you. I'm still
text: holding on Kelly and she looks very
dialog: concerned. I could relieve all
dialog: that anguish in a fraction of a
dialog: second. Shall I?
text: Stu is hearing these words but thinking only of what the man
text: on the line has done to him. His turn has come to fight
text: back. He has an idea.
text: If the sniper is focused on Kelly, he can't be watching Stu.
text: Turning his back to the police, Stu slowly sinks to his
dialog: knees.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I'm on my knees begging you.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Stand up, Stu. You're embarrassing
dialog: yourself.
scene_heading: TIGHT ANGLE --
text: Stu now down on his knees in the booth. He's curled up
text: almost into a fetal position.
text: By doing so, he hopes to hide the fact that he's reaching
text: into his pants pocket and pulling out his cellular phone.
text: He half expects to hear a shot ring out either from the
text: sniper or the cops. But nothing happens.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Stu -- I want you back on your feet
dialog: facing me. So you can see what I'm
dialog: going to do to her.
text: Stu ignores the command. He's quickly dialing.
dialog: 911.
dialog: He's calling police emergency.
speaker_heading: SNIPER'S POV
text: Stu seen through the cross hairs of the sniperscope,
text: crouched, doubled up at the foot of the booth. But the cell
text: phone is hidden in front of him.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Be a man, Stuart. Don't let them
dialog: see you like this. You're an
dialog: embarrassment to me.
scene_heading: WIDER SHOT - THE BOOTH
text: with Stu still kneeling.
speaker_heading: RACK FOCUS
text: to police across the street as their voices become clear --
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: (listening to
dialog: transmission)
text: Officer on east side of the street
dialog: reports subject removed a dark
text: metallic object from his pocket.
dialog: We better move.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: Hold all fire until you actually
dialog: identify a weapon. We're doing
dialog: this on fucking TV!
scene_heading: RACK FOCUS BACK TO -- STU IN THE BOOTH
text: crouched forward. The pay phone receiver dangles just above
text: his head. The cellular remains cupped in his hand.
text: Stu never lifts the cell phone. He keeps the palm of his
text: hand over the speaker of the phone to muffle any sound from
dialog: the other end.
text: It rings and finally someone answers.
scene_heading: EMERGENCY OPERATOR
dialog: (faint)
dialog: Police. Is this an emergency?
dialog: Hello? Is someone on the line?
text: But Stu addresses himself loudly to the pay phone which he
text: now grips in his other hand. Hoping that his words will be
text: picked up by the emergency operator listening via the
text: cellular. To help in this regard, he reaches back and slides
text: the door to the booth tightly closed.
text: He pretends to be talking to the sniper but his words are
text: meant for the 911 operator to hear.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: (loud)
dialog: You've made your point. Who's
dialog: going to believe I've got a sniper
text: with a telescopic sight holding me
dialog: in a fucking phone booth at 45th
dialog: and 8th?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: It took you a while to believe it
dialog: yourself.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: If you'd put a bullet in that
dialog: Captain Ramey, it would've been a
dialog: different story -- but you were too
dialog: wise to do that.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Why don't you do it for me? Wave
dialog: the old captain back over and get
dialog: him nice and close and then use the
text: handgun on him.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: (talking loud)
dialog: Why me? You could pick off any of
dialog: those cops from your window up
dialog: there. Like you did that pimp.
dialog: And that tourist last week. But
dialog: this time you want me to do your
dialog: killing for you.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: And you will! To save Kelly.
scene_heading: EXTREME TIGHT SHOT - CELL PHONE
text: cupped in Stu's hand and held low. Can they hear him on the
dialog: other end?
scene_heading: EMERGENCY OPERATOR
dialog: (muffled, almost
dialog: inaudible)
dialog: Can you speak up, sir? What is
dialog: your name?
text: Stu is concerned that the sniper might hear the voice of the
text: emergency operator. He sets the cell phone down flat on the
text: floor of the booth facing upward. He puts his foot over the
text: receiving end to muffle the incoming voice. Then he stands
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: That's better, Stu. Now turn
dialog: around so I can see you.
text: Stu talks close into the pay phone receiver now. But keeps
text: his voice raised.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: This booth. It's my whole world --
text: shrunk down to four feet by three
text: feet. Not much bigger than the
text: size of a coffin.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: They can put handles on the booth
dialog: and bury you in it.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: (loudly into pay phone)
dialog: When I saw you put that bullet into
dialog: that black dude, I knew you'd never
dialog: let me out of this phone booth
dialog: alive.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: You're wasting my time. Reach up
dialog: and take the gun.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: (peering upward,
dialog: squinting)
dialog: Let me see you first. What harm
dialog: can that do you? You're in one of
dialog: those windows. I've got to know
dialog: which one.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: No need for that.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Being so far, I could never
dialog: identify you. I don't even want
dialog: to.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: What is it then?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Don't worry that I'd try to point
dialog: you out. You'd shut me up with one
dialog: of your .30 calibre hollow points
dialog: before I could even raise a finger.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Why does it matter so much?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I want to see that you exist. Like
dialog: God exists. It's not enough to
dialog: believe. You want to see him --
text: just once -- even at a distance.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: And then you'd take the gun down.
dialog: And use it. We have a deal on
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Show yourself to me and I'll take
dialog: the gun down. I swear.
text: There's a pause as the sniper mulls it over.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I don't have to make deals. And
dialog: you're irritating me by trying to
dialog: negotiate. God doesn't have to
dialog: prove anything. He just strikes
dialog: you down when he gets in the mood.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Stop! I won't ask to see you
dialog: anymore.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I'm glad that's settled. But look
dialog: who else has showed up?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I guess she saw the coverage on TV
dialog: and just couldn't keep away.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: The 'hotel' just arrived. And a
dialog: very beautiful little hotel she is.
dialog: Actually, I'd classify her as more
text: of a motel.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Mavis? I don't see her.
speaker_heading: VOICE
text: She's too far back behind the
dialog: police line. But I've got a fine
text: shot at her from up here.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: You don't even know what she looks
dialog: like.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: You're in an enviable position now,
dialog: Stu. You get to choose between
dialog: them. Tell me which one.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I can't.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Which will it be? Kelly or Mavis?
dialog: Or should I simply select one?
scene_heading: INSERT SHOT - THE CELL PHONE
text: lying face up on the floor of the booth. Is anybody
dialog: listening?
dialog: BACK TO STU
text: Stu looks down at the cellular. He has no way of knowing if
text: the police operator can hear any of his words.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I need time to think...
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: You've got to be more in touch with
dialog: your feelings. You said you love
dialog: Kelly.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I do.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Then I'm doing you a favor putting
dialog: you out of the way of temptation.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: It wasn't Mavis' fault. It was all
dialog: my fault.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Then take the third option. Reach
dialog: above you and pick up the gun.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: You'll leave them both alone?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: There won't be much point in
dialog: harming them without you around to
dialog: impress.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I'll do it.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Let me see you do it.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I need one minute. One last
dialog: minute, please. Can you give me
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Don't tell me you're going to say
dialog: your prayers?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Something like that.
text: WE RACK FOCUS AWAY TO LONG SHOT - THE POLICE
text: assembled on the opposite side of the street.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: They should've traced the fucking
dialog: call by now.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: (listening on transmitter)
text: There's something else coming in.
dialog: A 911 operator says your name was
dialog: mentioned by somebody that's still
text: on the line. Somebody talking
text: about a phone booth. And a sniper.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: Patch me through. Hello, this is
dialog: Captain Edward Ramey. What about
dialog: that call?
scene_heading: EMERGENCY OPERATOR
text: The line is still open. It's
text: originating from a booth at 45th
dialog: and 8th.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: We're there! Can you play me back
dialog: your recording of the entire call?
scene_heading: EMERGENCY OPERATOR
dialog: I can't replay the tape while it's
text: still running.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: Then switch to another machine and
dialog: play back what you've got.
scene_heading: EMERGENCY OPERATOR
text: It's awful faint. He's not talking
text: directly into the receiver.
text: Ramey begins to listen. We hear snatches of Stu's call
text: picking up words which are at times incomprehensible.
speaker_heading: STU'S VOICE
dialog: (faint)
dialog: 'Who's going to believe I've got a
text: sniper with a telescopic sight
dialog: holding me in some fucking phone
dialog: booth...'
text: The uniformed TELEPHONE TECHNICIAN now joins Ramey and the
dialog: Sergeant.
scene_heading: TELEPHONE TECHNICIAN
dialog: Got what you wanted. The call's
text: coming from up the street. The
dialog: Hotel Broadway.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: Have you got the room?
scene_heading: TELEPHONE TECHNICIAN
dialog: It's not that easy. Electronic
dialog: switchboard.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: (to Sergeant)
dialog: Move your SWAT units to the hotel.
dialog: No... wait. Any movement will
text: alert the sniper. If he sees any
dialog: of us withdraw, he may panic.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
text: There's another SWAT unit on the
dialog: way.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: Intercept them. Divert them to the
dialog: hotel.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: It's done.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: Send them in from the Forty-third
dialog: Street side. I don't want any
dialog: activity the sniper might catch
dialog: sight of. He's probably high up
dialog: and facing that booth. He's got to
dialog: continue to believe our full
text: attention is focused on the man
dialog: inside -- whoever the hell that
dialog: poor bastard is.
dialog: (to emergency operator)
dialog: Hello 911 operator, I missed some
dialog: of that. Run it halfway back and
dialog: repeat it.
speaker_heading: STU'S VOICE (REPLAY)
dialog: (faint)
dialog: '... Like you did that pimp. And
dialog: that tourist last week. But this
dialog: time you want me to do the killing
dialog: for you...'
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: (listening)
dialog: Jesus... he's a dead man.
scene_heading: BACK INSIDE PHONE BOOTH
speaker_heading: VOICE
text: The police seem all excited about
dialog: something, Stu.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Are they? I wasn't looking.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I can't wait any longer. Say amen,
text: then reach up for the gun. When
dialog: your hand comes down, I want to see
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I'm too afraid.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: For once, be brave. Surprise
dialog: yourself.
speaker_heading: STU
text: I'm shaking all over.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Guys in combat situations even shit
text: their pants. But they follow
dialog: orders.
speaker_heading: STU
text: As soon as the cops see a gun,
dialog: they'll open fire.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Then I'd advise you to fire first.
text: Stu's arm goes up in a supreme act of willpower.
text: His fingers run along the two clouded plastic sheets that
text: cover the roof of the booth. It raises up easily at the
text: middle where two sheets join.
scene_heading: TIGHT INSERT SHOT
text: The space between the roof of the booth and the sheets of
text: clouded plastic. We see the fluorescent lighting fixture
text: covered with dust. The solitary object -- a cruel-looking
dialog: weapon.
text: Now Stu's fingertips protrude into the small space. He
text: touches the gun, brushes back and forth, feeling the
text: roughness of the grip.
scene_heading: TIGHT SHOT - STU'S FACE
text: as below he continues to hesitate -- it's agony --
text: The sweat pours down his forehead and his eyes are squeezed
text: tightly shut. He can already imagine the police bullets
text: tearing into him.
text: A POLICE SNIPER IS MOVING INTO POSITION.
speaker_heading: POLICE SNIPER
dialog: (into transmitter)
dialog: Give me the word.
text: RACK BACK TO STU - IN THE BOOTH
text: His arm still raised. He hasn't brought it down with the gun
text: in it. Not yet. He holds the pay phone receiver jammed up
text: against his mouth.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Hard part's over. Drop your arm
dialog: and point it like you'd point your
text: finger and squeeze.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: No. You do it. If you want me
dialog: dead, then fucking murder me!
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Why must I keep invoking some poor
dialog: girl's name every time we come to
dialog: an impasse? I'm focused back on
dialog: Kelly again. You're obviously not
dialog: willing to trade your life for
dialog: hers.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I am! I'm doing it!
text: He pulls the handgun down into full view. Curiously, the
text: police do not open fire.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: There! You see it? They all see
dialog: it.
text: He waves the gun so nobody can miss it.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Where are you? Damn you!!
text: He drops the receiver and steps halfway out of the booth.
text: Still the cops do not open fire.
text: Then Stu starts shooting.
text: Not at the police, but at the high rise buildings across the
dialog: street.
text: At the thousands of windows that look down upon him.
text: He gets off two shots before a solitary rifle shot rings out
dialog: in response.
text: RACK FOCUS TO THE POLICE SNIPER
text: He has fired.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON STU
text: The remaining glass on the south side of the booth shatters.
text: Stu tumbles forward, sprawling out of the booth onto the
dialog: pavement.
text: RACK FOCUS TO KELLY
text: She screams, tries to break through but cops restrain her.
scene_heading: INT. PHONE BOOTH
scene_heading: ANGLE ON DANGLING RECEIVER
text: as it sways back and forth. From it, we hear the voice.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Thanks for such an interesting
dialog: afternoon.
text: THEN THERE ARE OTHER SOUNDS EMANATING FROM THE DANGLING
text: SWAYING PHONE.
text: A wooden door being battered open. A few incomprehensible
text: shouts as a SWAT TEAM dashes in. Stu's stalling for time has
dialog: paid off.
text: THE SOUND OF A BARRAGE OF GUNFIRE.
text: THE SOUND OF A MUFFLED SCREAM.
text: The police have broken in on Stu's tormentor and there has
text: been a rapid exchange of shots.
text: A HAND reaches into the booth and grabs the receiver.
text: ANGLE WIDENS as Ramey places it to his ear.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: Hello? This is Captain Ramey.
dialog: Somebody talk to me.
scene_heading: SWAT OFFICER'S VOICE
dialog: Yeah. We took him out, Captain.
dialog: Nobody else got hurt.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: What's his condition?
scene_heading: SWAT OFFICER'S VOICE
text: Critical. The sonofabitch took
dialog: two. Probably won't survive the
dialog: ride.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: Get a statement from him. I'll be
dialog: right over.
text: He drops the receiver so that it dangles again.
text: CAMERA FOLLOWS RAMEY to where Stu lies surrounded by cops and
text: medics. He's stunned, but very much alive.
speaker_heading: MEDIC
dialog: Don't try to sit up.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: What was that?
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: (kneeling)
text: Rubber bullet.
speaker_heading: MEDIC
dialog: You'll have one hell of a nasty
dialog: welt. Busted rib. Maybe a
dialog: permanent scar there.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: It couldn't hurt much more if you
dialog: really shot me.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: Somebody was going to and we
dialog: thought it may as well be us.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Did you get him?
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: Sure as hell did. Thanks to you.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Still alive?
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: Barely.
speaker_heading: MEDIC
dialog: We'll be giving him a hypo for the
dialog: pain. It'll put him out for a
dialog: while.
text: Kelly is now brought over by a female cop. She drops to her
text: knees beside Stu and tries to embrace him. The medics
text: restrain her.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: It's okay. I'm not really shot.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I was so afraid. I thought...
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I thought so, too. But we're going
dialog: to be alright. Both of us.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Remember how you swore up and down
dialog: you'd get me on TV? Well, you did.
dialog: I already got interviewed on Fox
dialog: and Channel Eleven and they even
dialog: want me on A.M. America tomorrow
dialog: morning.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Bet you didn't think I could
dialog: deliver on that.
speaker_heading: MEDIC
dialog: Will you please let go of him,
dialog: Miss?
text: A gurney is wheeled over from a police ambulance. The medic
text: is about to administer the hypo but Stu pushes him away.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: No. No hypo. I want to see him
dialog: first.
text: The medics are now ready to lift Stu onto the gurney and cart
text: him off. But Stu struggles against them.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: Relax. The guy's dying.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: That's why I've gotta talk to him.
dialog: Please!
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: We'll see.
speaker_heading: MEDIC
dialog: (to Kelly)
dialog: You can ride with him in the
dialog: ambulance.
text: The woman cop escorts Kelly to the waiting ambulance.
text: Ramey meanwhile tries to resume contact with the SWAT team
text: inside the hotel.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: This is Ramey. Over. This is
dialog: Ramey. Ten-Four.
text: There's nothing but static, mixed up feedback and multiple
text: garbled voices on the other end of the line.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: Shit. Get everybody off this
dialog: wavelength.
text: He crosses back to the phone booth -- picks up the dangling
dialog: receiver.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: Hello. Hello! Pick up! Yeah,
dialog: it's Ramey again. Can you hold the
dialog: phone close enough so the perp can
dialog: listen?
speaker_heading: COP'S VOICE
dialog: He's not saying a word, Captain.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: He's not about to talk to us.
dialog: Maybe to him.
text: Ramey looks back to where the medics are still trying to lift
text: Stu onto the gurney.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: Forget that. Stand him up.
dialog: (to Stu)
dialog: Can you stand?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I can try.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: Help him over here.
text: The medics support Stu and inch him back to the booth. It's
text: painful, but Stu ignores it.
text: Ramey holds the phone up so Stu can both listen and speak.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: Here. Speak up.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: (into pay phone)
dialog: It's me. Do you hear me? Answer
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: (wheezing)
dialog: Had to have the last word, Stu.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I finally beat your ass. Admit it,
dialog: you fuck.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: But you'll never forget me. I gave
dialog: you the most thrilling day of your
dialog: life. Say thanks.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Now you're gonna die, you bastard.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I lost a lot of blood. Don't you
dialog: want to donate some for me? Then
dialog: we'd really be part of each other.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Hang on. I can't wait to see you
dialog: at the hospital. So I can yank
dialog: your fucking air tube out.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Wish I could give you that
dialog: pleasure. You deserve it.
dialog: (coughing)
dialog: ... Only I'm out of time.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: What's your name? At least tell me
dialog: who you are.
text: There's more violent coughing, then silence. Then a cop's
text: voice is heard.
speaker_heading: COP'S VOICE
text: He's gone.
text: Stu stares at the receiver.
speaker_heading: RAMEY
dialog: Don't worry. We'll find out who he
dialog: is. And why he picked you.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: No. You won't.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: What do you want to bet you won't?
text: Stu reaches over and hangs up the receiver. CLICK.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I'll spend my whole life trying to
dialog: figure that out.
text: Then he sinks into the arms of the medics who lower him onto
text: the waiting gurney.
text: The hypo is finally administered. It kicks in immediately,
text: relieving the pain.
text: He's wheeled away from the booth to the waiting ambulance.
text: Kelly is already inside waiting to accompany Stu to the
dialog: hospital.
text: STU'S POV - BEING WHEELED AWAY FROM THE EMPTY BOOTH
text: pulling away in LOW ANGLE.
text: CAMERA SLIDES BACK inside the ambulance with Stu. The doors
text: shut, obliterating our view of the phone booth that was his
dialog: entire world until moments ago.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: (groggy)
dialog: Gotta sleep now. No phone calls...
text: Kelly smiles down at him as the image blurs. Stu passes out
text: -- into a deep sleep he much deserves.
text: A SIREN BLARES.
text: CUT TO BLACK.
dialog:
