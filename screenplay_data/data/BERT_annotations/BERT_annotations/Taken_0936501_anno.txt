speaker_heading: OPEN TO
text: A home video of a five year old birthday party where BRYAN
text: MILLS, at 32, and his wife LENORE make a big fuss over their
text: daughter, KIM. It seems like the happiest of families,
text: opening presents, blowing out candles, husband and wife loving
text: with one another, and with their daughter.
text: The video runs to black.
text: The sound of a man's labored breathing replaces the images.
text: A light is switched on and we are in...
scene_heading: INT. BRYAN'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Bryan at 48, looking years younger, in good shape, wakes
text: suddenly from where he had dozed off on his couch in his
text: small non descript, generically furnished, anonymous two
dialog: bedroom apartment. The instruction manual for a Karaoke
text: machine he was reading falls to the floor.
dialog: We realize that this was not a home movie, but a dream.
text: Bryan takes a moment to clear his head, looks around at his
text: anonymous surroundings, his eyes focus on a picture of a 12
text: year old girl on a horse in full dressage, Kim, his daughter,
text: grown up. He breathes out heavily, his heart hollow. He
text: picks up the manual from the floor, looks at it.
text: All is not right in his world. It shows in his eyes.
scene_heading: EXT. LOS ANGELES - DAY
text: Bryan drives his innocuous three year old Nissan past the
text: Hollywood sign, pulls into a modest strip mall. Parks in
text: Front of a small appliance store. Exits the car with the
text: Karaoke manual in hand. Enters the store.
scene_heading: INT. SMALL APPLIANCE STORE - DAY
text: Bryan enters the cluttered store, which is jammed from floor
text: to ceiling with every type of electronic gadget. He is
text: greeted by the owner, SINGH, a turbaned Sikh.
speaker_heading: SINGH
dialog: Mr. Mills, how are you?
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: I'm fine. How are you, Mr. Singh?
speaker_heading: Â© INGH
dialog: Very fine. I suppose you want to
dialog: see it again?
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: If you don't mind.
speaker_heading: SINGH
text: An educated consumer is a happy
dialog: consumer... You know where it is.
text: Bryan walks over to a Karaoke machine.
speaker_heading: SINGH
dialog: You know if I charged you a dollar
dialog: for every time you came in to examine
dialog: the machine, you'd already own
dialog: it...twice over.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: I was looking over the manual and I
text: noticed on page seventeen there is
dialog: an auto record feature, but I didn't
dialog: remember seeing it...
text: Singh presses a button and a disc slot opens up.
speaker_heading: SINGH
dialog: Auto record.
text: Bryan examines the machine along with the manual.
speaker_heading: SINGH
dialog: Not for anything, but you know it's
dialog: the one all the pros use. Mariah.
dialog: Beyonce. Gwen Stefani.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Really?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Who's Beyonce?
text: Singh looks at him.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Only kidding. I'll take it.
scene_heading: INT. PAPER SHOP - DAY
text: Bryan is studiously comparing a dozen different decorative
text: wrapping papers.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: May I help you?
speaker_heading: . BRYAN
dialog: Just want to make sure I'm picking
dialog: the right one.
dialog: Keeps examining the different papers. Detail oriented is a
dialog: description that fits Bryan toa T.
scene_heading: INT. BRYAN'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Bryan is wrapping the Karaoke machine with a wrapping paper
text: that reads young. Brightly colored, with balloons and
dialog: confetti.
text: He cuts the paper precisely, makes the corners match just
dialog: so. As with everything else, he is meticulous. The way he
text: folds it is unique, using no tape.
text: His phone, on speaker, is ringing a number. The party on
text: the other end answers.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: (accented)
dialog: James residence.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: This is Bryan Mills. I'd like to
dialog: speak to my daughter.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: One moment please.
text: Bryan picks up, expecting his daughter. He answers with a
text: brightness in his voice...
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Hi honey...
text: That fades when he realizes it is...
speaker_heading: LENORE V.O.
dialog: It's me Bryan.
text: A bit of distance in her voice. Bryan stares at the picture
text: of Kim on his desk.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Oh hi. How are you?
speaker_heading: LENORE V.O.
text: Busy preparing.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Is Kim there?
speaker_heading: LENORE V.O.
text: Her stylist just arrived.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: (disappointed)
dialog: Oh. Listen, I know the invitation
dialog: calls for two, but I was going to
dialog: ask if I could come over at one.
speaker_heading: LENORE V.O.
dialog: You know, for a person who is such a
dialog: stickler for details, you would think
dialog: you'd read the invitation a little
text: more closely. Two for her friends.
text: Three for the adults.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: I read it. I just thought maybe I
dialog: could spend some one on one time
dialog: with her, y'know, before things got
dialog: busy.
speaker_heading: LENORE V.0O.
dialog: Bryan, you missed so many of the
dialog: events in her life, what difference
dialog: does an hour make?
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: (point of pride)
dialog: I've never missed a birthday.
speaker_heading: LENORE V.O.
dialog: I'll alert the media.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Sorry. That wasn't necessary. I'm
text: just in the middle of a lot here.
dialog: The flowers came and they're the
text: wrong pink. The DJ is stuck in
dialog: traffic...
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: I'll see you at three.
text: Bryan hangs up, feels shut out. He looks at his watch.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - DAY
text: The clock on the dashboard reads one minute to three.
scene_heading: PULL BACK TO
text: Bryan. Sitting in his Nissan, watching the clock, closely.
text: When the clock hits exactly three PM, he puts the car in
text: gear, looks through the windshield, at a walled compound,
text: where a line of Mercedes, Bentleys, Ferraris, Porsches, are
text: passing the security at the gate of...
scene_heading: EXT. JAMES MANSION - DAY
text: Bryan surrenders his car to a valet in the courtyard of the
text: magnificent mansion, removes the wrapped karaoke machine
text: from the back seat of his car, follows the rest of the adults
text: toward the front door.
text: Everyone else is dressed designer, Bryan is strictly off the
text: department store rack.
scene_heading: INT. JAMES MANSION - DAY
text: Bryan enters to a scene out of Homes of the Rich and Famous,
text: complete with the adult cast of characters.
text: Beyond, through the French doors, in the vast grounds that
text: stretch to the ocean, a no-expense-spared party is in full
text: swing. An endless buffet attended by a dozen wait staff is
text: set up under an expansive tent. On a dance floor laid over
text: the lawn, teenagers hold sway, dancing, flirting, junior
text: versions of their parents.
text: Off to the side, people line up to leave their gifts, which
text: are neatly organized into a small mountain by a maid.
text: Bryan ignores the line when he sees KIM in the back yard.
text: Not the twelve year old in the picture on his desk, but a
text: young woman of seventeen. Tall, beautiful, full of life. A
text: golden girl, who carries privilege easily, surrounded by
text: Friends, amidst a swirl of waiters, and photographers,
dialog: videographers.
scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD - JAMES MANSION - DAY
text: Bryan exits, is immediately intercepted by...
speaker_heading: SECURITY
dialog: Uh, sir excuse me, but the adult
text: party is inside.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: I'm Kim's father.
speaker_heading: SECURITY
dialog: Excuse me, but I work for her father.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
text: Her REAL father.
speaker_heading: SECURITY
dialog: Oh...
dialog: And then...
speaker_heading: LENORE
dialog: It's alright Cyril.
text: The Security backs off as LENORE, the woman in the home
text: video/dream, older, but still beautiful, dressed rich/casual,
text: the mistress of the exquisitely appointed mansion, appears.
speaker_heading: LENORE
dialog: (cool)
dialog: Hello Bryan.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Hello Lenore,
text: The moment is awkward, at best.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: I just wanted to give Kim her present.
speaker_heading: LENORE
dialog: We're letting the kids have their
dialog: Own space. You can put it with all
dialog: the others.
text: She points to the pile of presents inside.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: I wanted it to be more personal.
speaker_heading: LENORE
dialog: Still having trouble following the
dialog: rules, I see.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Oh come on Lennie...
speaker_heading: LENORE
dialog: I've asked you not to call me that
dialog: please.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Excuse me.
dialog: (pointed)
dialog: Lenore.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Hi...
text: He turns to his daughter.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Hello darling. Happy birthday.
text: He hands her the box.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Thanks!
text: She hugs him.
speaker_heading: LENORE
dialog: I was just telling your father we
dialog: arranged to have all the presents...
speaker_heading: . BRYAN
dialog: Open it.
speaker_heading: LENORE
dialog: Sweetie, I think it's bad manners to
dialog: open one and not...
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Here...
text: He takes the bow off, pulls one end of the wrapping. The
text: whole paper comes away neatly.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Cool.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: No tape. I learned it in Japan.
speaker_heading: LENORE
dialog: (bemused)
dialog: A karaoke machine?
text: The diminishing tone in her voice stings.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: (apologetic)
dialog: I figured she wants to he a singer,
speaker_heading: LENORE
dialog: When she was twelve Bryan. We've
dialog: moved on.
text: Bemusement mixes with a barely contained disdain.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Thank you Daddy.
text: She hugs him. And whispers in his ear.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: I still want to be a singer. Just
dialog: don't tell Mom.
text: A bit redeemed, Bryan takes out a disposable camera.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: OK. One for the book...
speaker_heading: LENORE
dialog: We have a professional photographer.
text: Bryan ignores Lenore's roll of the eyes.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Big smile.
text: Kim stands next to the machine, flashes a 24 karat smile.
text: And just as Bryan snaps the picture, a commotion from the
text: far side of the property draws her attention to...
text: STUART JAMES, rich, polished, impeccably dressed and coifed
text: cantering a magnificent specimen of a horse through the gate.
text: The crowd parts, and then, follows the horse and rider as
text: they head right for an astonished Kim, a delighted Lenore, a
text: chagrined Bryan.
text: Stuart pulls on the reins and comes to an abrupt halt right
text: in front of Kim, Lenore and Bryan. He leaps off the horse,
text: hands the reins to Kim.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Happy birthday darling.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Oh my god! Oh my god!
text: She throws her arms around his neck, peppers him with mad
dialog: kisses.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: I love you! I love you!
text: Bryan winces involuntarily, each word, each kiss a small
text: nick on his heart.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Give him a try.
text: Kim puts a foot in the stirrup, and with a boost from Stuart
text: she is in the saddle.
text: Her seat is excellent, her command of the huge animal
text: impressive. She jerks the reins, the horse responds, wheels
text: around and takes off at a canter across the lawn.
speaker_heading: LENORE
dialog: Stuart, you are impossible.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: I know. Hello Bryan.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Stuart.
text: The two men shake hands; Stuart with all the confidence of a
text: man who knows he is ahead on points; Bryan with the feeling
text: that he is losing ground rapidly.
dialog: 9.
text: Stuart looks over to Kim putting the horse through his paces
text: on the far side of the vast expanse of lawn.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: She's not a little girl anymore, is
dialog: she?
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: I guess not.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Staying for lunch?
speaker_heading: BRYAN |
dialog: No. I just wanted to come by and
dialog: wish her a happy birthday.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: I'm sure she appreciated it.
text: Bryan smiles thinly. Lenore takes Stuart's arm.
speaker_heading: LENORE
dialog: Darling, now that you've made your
text: grand entrance, come mingle.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Good to see you, Bryan.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: You too.
text: As Lenore and Stuart walk off, arm in arm, Bryan looks over
text: to where Kim is surrounded by her friends admiring her horse.
text: He looks down at his sorry little karaoke machine, feeling
dialog: outflanked. Isolated. ,
scene_heading: INT. SAV-ON DRUG STORE - EVENING
text: All neon and sale items. A clerk at the one hour developing
text: booth hands Bryan a packet of photos.
scene_heading: INT. BRYAN'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
speaker_heading: CLOSE UP
text: The picture of Kim with the karaoke machine. A photo album
text: cover marked HAPPY BIRTHDAY KIM.
scene_heading: PULL BACK TO
text: Bryan. Pasting the picture in an album. He turns the pages
text: backwards. Every page is marked with the year and Kim's age
text: over a birthday picture.
text: Bryan lingers over each and every picture, regret mingled
text: with the pleasure of reliving the moments.
dialog: 10.
text: The door bell rings, interrupting Bryan. He puts the album
text: aside, rises, heads for the door.
text: He answers to three men. SAM, BERNIE, AND CASEY. In their
text: hands, beer, wine, on their faces the knowledge that...
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You forgot.
text: Bryan stands there, chagrined. He did.
scene_heading: EXT. BRYAN'S PATIO - NIGHT
text: On the cramped cement patio, Bryan is tending steaks on a
text: small barbecue. While Sam preps some potatoes, Casey opens
text: the wine, and Bernie tosses the salad.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: It's not like I didn't call to remind
dialog: you. LA? Third Saturday in May?
dialog: Red meat, red wine? Sound familiar?
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: He probably had a lot on his mind.
speaker_heading: BERNIE
dialog: Yeah. The busy life of a retiree.
dialog: Every day a new adventure.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: So what does one do in retirement?
dialog: Take naps? Play golf? Chase rich
dialog: widows?
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: That takes care of the morning.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Go on, make fun. You know why I'm
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: How's that going?
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: OK. We had her birthday today.
dialog: Seventeen.
speaker_heading: BERNIE
dialog: Lennie still have a hard on for you?
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: She's not Lennie anymore. She's
dialog: Lenore.
speaker_heading: SAM
text: She still has a hard on.
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: And the husband?
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: The same. Perfect.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You dig deep enough, there's always
dialog: shit.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: You want us to dig?
speaker_heading: BERNIE
dialog: What? You think he hasn't done that?
dialog: Mr. Attention to Detail.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: How's Kim?
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Good. She's good.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: She spend the night yet?
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: We're working on it.
text: The men trade a knowing look.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Does she appreciate the fact that
dialog: you gave up your life to be close
dialog: by?
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: What life did I give up?
speaker_heading: BERNIE
dialog: Hey, you remember that time we were
dialog: in Beirut after the Chief disappeared,
dialog: and Bry was deep under with that
dialog: crazy fucking Sheik from Hezbollah?
dialog: The one who was gonna get us inside,
dialog: and then he disappeared?
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: And we're sure your cover was blown
dialog: and they were, like, pulling your
text: fingernails out one by one.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: And we're scrambling to get the fuck
dialog: outta Dodge before we get taken down.
dialog: And where the fuck are you?
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: I promised her I would never miss a
dialog: birthday.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: That went down well at Langley when
dialog: they found out you flew the coop to
dialog: attend your kid's birthday...nine
dialog: thousand miles away. Where did you
dialog: say your next posting was? The Arctic
dialog: circle spying on Penguins, I believe
dialog: it was.
speaker_heading: BERNIE
text: Penguins are in Antarctica.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: What's the point here?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: We still got a space open, Bry. All
dialog: you have to do is say the word, it's
dialog: yours.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Who likes theirs rare?
text: He lifts a steak off the grill.
scene_heading: EXT. BRYAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Bryan is seeing his friends off. Sam stops at the door as
text: the others walk to their car.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Look, all kidding aside, we think
dialog: it's a great thing what you're doing,
text: trying to make up for lost time with
dialog: your kid. But tomorrow's job? Right
dialog: here. Twenty five hundred bucks for
dialog: four hours work. Just for taking
text: some pop diva to and from her concert.
dialog: We're one short.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: A singer?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I don't know if you could call her a
dialog: singer exactly. More like a cash
dialog: cow. Twenty million records. Gets
dialog: as many death threats as marriage
dialog: proposals.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: (quick)
dialog: OK.
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Really.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Perfect. It'll be like old times.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Better. No one gets killed.
scene_heading: EXT. LOS ANGELES - NIGHT
text: The downtown skyline glitters on a crystal clear night.
scene_heading: EXT. ARENA - NIGHT
text: The lead car, followed by an SUV with blacked out windows,
text: swings around the rear of the arena, entering through the
text: rear entrance, waved through by the Arena Security.
scene_heading: INT. ARENA - NIGHT
text: The two cars stop. The doors open and the DIVA, a golden
text: tressed pop goddess, exits with her entourage, surrounded by
text: Bernie, Sam, Casey, and Bryan.
text: The press corp, kept at a distance, pops their flashes. A
text: handful fans scream her name. The Diva flashes her widest
text: smile, waves to the fans.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Ma'am if we can keep moving.
speaker_heading: DIVA
dialog: My mother is ma'tam, if you don't
dialog: mind.
text: And as if to show whose boss, she stops, waves to the fans,
text: vamps for the photographers, before moving on into the
dialog: dressing room.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Bernie, you and Casey are out here.
dialog: I'll be up front. Bry, you're in
dialog: the room.
text: Bryan enters.
scene_heading: INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
text: As the Diva is fussed over by her hair dresser and her make
text: up person, she warms up the pipes with Gio, running scales.
text: She sure can sing. She hits the last amazing high note,
text: holds it forever. Bryan stands in the corner. As she
dialog: finishes...
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: That was amazing.
text: For the first time the Diva notices Bryan.
speaker_heading: DIVA
dialog: Thank you. What did you say your
dialog: name was?
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Bryan. Bryan Mills.
speaker_heading: DIVA
dialog: Nice to meet you Bryan Mills.
text: She holds her hand out. He shakes it. A knock on the door.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: You're on!
text: The Diva tenses a bit. Everyone gets jumped up.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Let's do it darling!
text: The entourage starts for the door.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Excuse me...
text: Everyone stops.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: (awkward)
dialog: My daughter wants to be a singer...
dialog: I was wondering...if you had any
dialog: tips...
speaker_heading: DIVA
dialog: (short)
dialog: I do. Tell her to pick another
dialog: career.
text: The Diva sweeps out, Bryan is left in the room, feeling a
text: bit chagrined for asking.
scene_heading: INT. BACKSTAGE ROOM - NIGHT
text: With the muted sound of the concert beyond the door, Bryan,
text: Sam, Casey and Bernie play cards.
speaker_heading: BERNIE
dialog: So we're up on this ridge, right?
text: Twelve thousand feet in the middle
dialog: of bum fuck nowhere Kyrgyzstan.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: BERNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Looking down on this shit hole mud
dialog: and straw compound the target 1s
dialog: holed up in. Freezing our asses off
dialog: because it's like 15 degrees. Wind
text: blowing like a motherfucker. The
text: damn camels are farting away like
text: the tubas in the Rose bowl parade.
dialog: We're eating fried sheep ass for
dialog: three days. We're waiting on the
dialog: air strike, and we're waiting and
dialog: we're waiting. And my cell phone
dialog: rings. And it's the guy we're looking
dialog: to terminate. He's calling to ask
dialog: if we want some tea sent up to keep
dialog: warm because he just heard the air
dialog: strike was called off due to inclement
dialog: weather. I mean, come on...
text: A cell phone rings. Bryan's.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Hello?
dialog: (brightens)
dialog: Oh hi honey.
dialog: (to the guys)
dialog: Kim...
text: He folds his cards, stopping the game.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Hey! Come on! I got a hot hand
dialog: here!
text: Bryan couldn't care less. He shrugs an "I'm sorry", exits
dialog: the room.
scene_heading: INT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
text: The music is blaring in the BG as Bryan steps out of the
dialog: room.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: The noise? At a concert. You
dialog: recognize the song? Right. That's
dialog: her. No, I'm not attending. Just
dialog: helping out some friends with the
dialog: security. Of course I met her. Who
dialog: do you think's guarding her? No,
dialog: she's not a bitch. Yes. She's very
dialog: nice. I'm glad you're impressed.
dialog: Hey, I'm happy you called. Lunch?
dialog: Tomorrow?
text: Bryan's heart leaps at the possibility.
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Sure. I know the place. See you
dialog: then. Love you too.
text: Bryan hangs up, buoyed by the call.
scene_heading: INT. BACKSTAGE ROOM - NIGHT
text: Bryan steps back in, a smile on his face.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: And...?
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: She wants to have lunch.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Just the two of us.
speaker_heading: GUYS
dialog: Alright! There's progress! A date
dialog: with your daughter! Will wonders
dialog: never cease?
text: Bryan smiles sheepish, takes the kidding, but is so pleased.
speaker_heading: LATER
text: The show is over, entourage is streaming back stage. The
text: Diva is taking one last curtain call. The cars are lined
text: up, ready to go. Sam and his team are at the ready, when
text: all of the sudden, from the side of the arena, a door bursts
text: open and a wave of frenzied fans come running.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Who left that door open?
text: Just then the Diva appears. The mob sees her.
speaker_heading: MOB
dialog: There she is!!
text: As they surge, the Diva seems to freeze, panic.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: OK. Let's get her out of here.
dialog: Bry. Take the lead.
text: More people come surging from the stage now.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: This way!
text: Sam, Bernie and Casey cover the rear as Bryan leads the Diva
text: towards the waiting cars.
text: Suddenly the situation deteriorates. More fans press in
text: past the barriers.
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: FANS
dialog: She's there!
text: Bryan, keeping her in front of him, keeping his eye over his
text: shoulder does not see a lone man in a long coat, suddenly
text: lunging out of the shadows. As he turns, his reactions kick
text: in. He leaps in front of the terrified Diva just as the
text: knife is about to plunge into her.
text: In the blink of an eye, he grabs the knife hand, twists it
text: back in one swift movement, turning the coat sleeve inside
text: out on the knife, delivers one swift blow that puts the
text: assailant on the floor.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Casey!
text: Casey pins the guy down.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Go!
text: Bryan spins the Diva around, pushes her into the car, jumps
text: in behind her...
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Go!
text: Slams the door. The car zooms out.
scene_heading: INT. SUV - NIGHT
text: The car blasts out of the arena.
text: The Diva, alone with Bryan in the back of the car, is shaking
text: like a leaf.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Here, Drink this.
text: Hands her a coke.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: The sugar will ward off the shock.
text: She drinks, gulps. Stops to take a breath. And then breaks
text: down, starts sobbing. She drops onto Bryan's chest, sobs
text: and sobs. Bryan lets his arms wrap around her, awkward, but
dialog: gentle.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: It's OK. You're safe...
text: Doing his best to comfort what is now a hysterical, scared
dialog: little girl.
dialog: 18.
scene_heading: EXT. DIVA'S SUITE - HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Sam is handing each man his cash.
dialog: Hands the

dialog: head out,
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Casey...Bernie...
dialog: cash to Bryan.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Rambo...
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Hey...c'mon...
speaker_heading: BERNIE
dialog: Seriously, Bry. You should think
dialog: about coming with us. You still got
dialog: the edge. Lot more of this to be
dialog: had.
dialog: cash.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Next year she goes to college, right?
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You know you lose her.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: That gives me a year to find her.
text: the Diva's door opens, a somber Victor sticks his
text: nods to Bryan.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: She would like to see you.
scene_heading: INT. DIVA'S SUITE - NIGHT
text: Bryan enters to a very subdued Diva.
speaker_heading: DIVA
dialog: You said your daughter wants to be a
dialog: singer?
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Since she's five.
speaker_heading: DIVA
dialog: You know it's not what everyone thinks
dialog: it is.
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: BRYAN

speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Tt's what she wants.
text: The Diva gives him a card.
speaker_heading: DIVA
dialog: The first number is Gio, my voice
dialog: coach. He has the best ear in the
dialog: business. If he says she can sing,
dialog: she can sing. He'll give her the
dialog: voice coaching she needs. His fee
dialog: is on me. The second number is my
dialog: manager. If Gio clears her, he'll
dialog: make sure she gets the shot.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'm sorry for the way I behaved

speaker_heading: BRYAN

speaker_heading: CLOSE UP
text: On the card,
scene_heading: INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY
text: Bryan sits, turning the card over in his hand, feeling very

text: But his smile dies as he also sees...

speaker_heading: LENORE
dialog: Hello Bryan.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Hi.
text: His excitement subdues, he palms the card.
speaker_heading: LENORE
dialog: Don't look so excited.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: I was just surprised. I thought it
dialog: was just going to be...y'know...
text: He points to the two of them.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: I asked Mom to come.
text: As they take their seats, Kim just bubbles with excitement.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Guess what? You know my Â£riend
dialog: Amanda? Her cousins invited us to
dialog: stay with them over vacation.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: In Paris. How cool is that?
text: Bryan is less than thrilled to hear this.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: âWhy do you want to go to Paris?
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Dad! Hello? The Louvre, the
dialog: Impressionist museum. The Picasso
dialog: Museum?
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: I didn't know you were so into art.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Are you kidding? I've been to the
dialog: MoMA, like, a hundred times. Amanda
dialog: went last summer and she came home
dialog: she could practically speak French!
text: Now Bryan gets the reason for the lunch. He deflates a bit.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: (tightening)
dialog: And because you're under eighteen
dialog: you need my permission to leave the
dialog: country.
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Please Daddy. I really want to do
dialog: it! They have this, like, sick
text: apartment overlooking the river.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Just you and Amanda.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: And her cousins!
speaker_heading: LENORE
dialog: Don't make a big deal out of this
dialog: Bryan. Just sign the paper.
text: She puts the paper out for him, with a pen. He does not
dialog: move.
speaker_heading: LENORE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: I'm not comfortable with it.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Daddy!
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: I know the world sweetie..
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: It's not Iraq!
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: It's seven thousand miles. It's
dialog: another country.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Daddy please!
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: T'm sorry sweetie. I don't think a
dialog: seventeen year old should be traveling
dialog: alone.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: I won't be alone!
speaker_heading: BRYAN
text: Two seventeen year olds.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Amanda's eighteen!
text: Bryan considers for a moment.
dialog: a2.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Well, how about this? How about I
dialog: go along?
text: Kim rolls her eyes.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: You won't even know I'm there. I'm
dialog: very good at invisible.
speaker_heading: LENORE
dialog: As you have so amply demonstrated
dialog: for most of her life.
text: The bite in her words makes him tighten even more.
speaker_heading: LENORE
dialog: Just sign the god damn paper Bryan.
text: Bryan looks from Lenore, to Kim, to the paper, and back to
dialog: Kim again.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Let me think about it.
speaker_heading: LENORE
dialog: That's a no.
dialog: (to Kim)
dialog: I knew this was a waste of time.
dialog: (to Bryan)
dialog: I told her.
text: Kim bolts up.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Kim...there's something else...
text: He brings up the card.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: I don't want anything else!
text: Kim runs off.
speaker_heading: LENORE
dialog: You know, I don't get you. You
dialog: sacrificed our marriage in the service
dialog: of the country. You made a mess of
dialog: your life in the service of your
dialog: country. Can't you sacrifice a little
dialog: this one time for your own daughter?
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: I'd sacrifice anything for her.
speaker_heading: LENORE
dialog: Then what is your problem.
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: T am not comfortable putting my
dialog: daughter at risk.
speaker_heading: LENORE :
dialog: Putting your daughter at risk? By
dialog: going to Paris? You're pathetic.
text: She follows Kim out.
text: Bryan is left looking at the paper, and the Diva's card in
text: his hand.
speaker_heading: CLOSE UP
text: A hand knocks on a door.
scene_heading: EXT. JAMES MANSION - DAY
text: The door is opened by a puffy eyed Kim. She looks at Bryan,
text: suspicious, sees the paper in his hand.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Three conditions...
text: Kim's suspicion begins to melt.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: I want the address and phone number
dialog: where you are staying.
text: Her smile begins to build.
speaker_heading: KIM
speaker_heading: ORK.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: If you move, I want to know where
dialog: and with whom you will be staying.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: OK.
text: The smile grows.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: You call me when you land. You call
dialog: me every night before you go to sleep.
text: He hands her a phone.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: It's international. My number is
dialog: programmed in.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: OK.
dialog: 24.
text: The smile is ear to ear.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: And I want you to let me take you to
dialog: the airport.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: OK. OK.
text: Bryan hands her the paper. She leaps on his neck. Kissing
text: him. Hugging him.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Thank you! Thank you! I'm gonna go
dialog: call Amanda!
text: She runs off. A second later she is back. Hugs Bryan again.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: I love you Daddy!!!
text: Off she goes, passing Lenore, who has just come to the door.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: He signed it!
text: Waves the paper in front of Lenore, bolts off; Leaving Bryan
text: and Lenore looking at each other.
speaker_heading: LENORE
dialog: Wouldn't it have been easier just to
dialog: sign the first time around?
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Wouldn't it have been easier if you
dialog: and I talked about it first?
text: She has no answer to that, closes the door.
scene_heading: INT. BRYAN'S CAR - DAY
text: Bryan and Kim on the way to the airport. Kim is wearing a
text: jean jacket with a heart of red sequins embroidered on the
dialog: Front.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: There are certain areas in Paris
dialog: that you should avoid. I've written
dialog: them down...
text: He hands her a piece of paper.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Daddy, we're going to be spending,
dialog: like, ninety percent of our time in
dialog: museums. You don't have to worry.
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: That's like telling water not to be
dialog: wet.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Mom says your job made you paranoid.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: My job made me aware.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: I always used to ask mom what your
dialog: job was that you were away all the
dialog: time. She would tell me to ask you.
dialog: But when ever I saw you I was afraid
dialog: to ask.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: I don't know, Maybe because I was
dialog: afraid to find out. That it was
dialog: something I wouldn't like.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: I worked for the government.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: You were, like, a spy, right?
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: I was a preventer.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: What did you prevent?
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Bad things from happening.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: So that was a good job.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Yes it was.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Do you miss it?
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: I missed you more.

scene_heading: EXT. LAX - DAY
text: Bryan is lifting her suitcase out of the trunk, when Kim
dialog: sees...
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: There's Amanda!
text: A pretty blonde girl waves to her from inside the terminal.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Go ahead. I'll bring your bags.
text: Kim goes running into the terminal. Bryan watches her go,
text: sees the word DOLLFACE in sequined script across the back of
text: her jacket. It makes him smile.
text: He goes to grab the smaller hand luggage out of the trunk,
text: sees a map in the side pocket. Knowing better, but not being
text: able to resist, he takes the map out.
speaker_heading: Bryan's POV
text: A map of Europe, with different cities circled in several
text: countries, with dates next to each one. He does not like
text: what he sees.
text: He puts the map back, is about to lift the luggage, when a
text: chauffeured Rolls Royce pulls right in front of him. He
text: gives a small grimace.
text: And sure enough, the chauffeur opens the door and Lenore
dialog: exits.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Charles...
text: Calls to the chauffeur.
speaker_heading: LENORE
dialog: Give Mr. Mills a hand.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: I can manage.
text: Bryan picks up both bags, slams the trunk with his elbow.
text: Lenore heads for the door.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Lenore. Can I talk to you a minute?
text: She stops.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Do you know about this?
text: He takes out the map.
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: She's not just going to Paris.
speaker_heading: LENORE
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: This is bullshit.
speaker_heading: LENORE
dialog: No Bryan, what's bullshit is she
dialog: can't be honest with you because of
dialog: your bullshit.
speaker_heading: | BRYAN
dialog: My bullshit?
speaker_heading: LENORE
dialog: The rules and conditions...
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: What is it?
text: Referring to the map.
speaker_heading: LENORE
dialog: It's U2's European tour dates.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: She's following a band around Europe?
speaker_heading: LENORE
dialog: All the kids do. Stuart got her the
dialog: tickets, we've arranged for her to
dialog: stay in good hotels.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: (pissed)
dialog: Good hotels? You know, you live in
dialog: your little bubble here, behind your
dialog: wall, with your chauffeurs and maids
dialog: and stylists...
text: He catches himself as his contempt builds.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: You have no idea what the world is
dialog: like Lenore.
speaker_heading: LENORE
dialog: And neither will she unless she goes
dialog: out and experiences it. And don't
dialog: you tell me I do not know what the
dialog: world is like. For five years I
dialog: would wait for a phone call that
dialog: didn't come for weeks at a time.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: LENORE (CONT'D)
dialog: For a knock on the door telling me
dialog: there would be no calls anymore. I
dialog: became an expert on foreign affairs.
dialog: I read the paper every day Bryan.
dialog: Beirut, Teheran, Bogota. Damascus.
text: Looking for a hint, a glimmer of
dialog: light behind that curtain you pulled
dialog: over what you did.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: I did it to protect you.
speaker_heading: LENORE
dialog: From what? Worrying? You think not
dialog: knowing made me worry less? You
dialog: think being shut out of your life
dialog: protected me?
text: She catches herself, checks her anger, takes a breath.
speaker_heading: LENORE
dialog: I know we have our issues. But I'm
dialog: going to give you a piece of advice.
dialog: You moved here to try and build some
dialog: sort of relationship with your
dialog: daughter. You're not going to do
dialog: that by smothering her. Let her
dialog: live or I promise you, you'll lose
dialog: her.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And for god's sake, don't ruin this
dialog: For her.
text: Lenore turns and enters the terminal, leaving Bryan to deal
text: with the bags and the information he cannot act on, leaving
text: him frustrated, impotent.
scene_heading: INT. AIRPORT SECURITY - DAY

text: Waves to Kim, hold his hand up to his ear like a phone. Kim

text: Bryan snaps a picture of Kim and Amanda mugging with his

scene_heading: INT. PARIS APARTMENT - DAY

dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Did he know where you were staying?
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Yes. He took a cab with us.

text: Switches it on. It amplifies Kim's voice, and all the sounds
text: around her.
text: Kim watches the window, as the men drag Amanda away.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Daddy! They took her! They took
dialog: her!
dialog: 38.

speaker_heading: KIM

dialog: Climb under the bed. Tell me when
dialog: you are there.
text: Bryan does his best to contain his rising anxiety, to stay
dialog: calm.
text: Kim is now under the bed.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: T'm here,
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Now, the next part is very important.
dialog: They are going to take you..
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Oh god...
text: Kim stifles a terrified cry.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Kim. Stay focused baby. This is
dialog: key. You will have five, maybe ten
dialog: seconds. Very important seconds.
dialog: Leave the phone on the floor. You
dialog: must concentrate. Shout out
dialog: everything you see about them. Hair
text: color, eye color, tall, short, scars.
dialog: Anything you see. You understand?
dialog: 39.
text: Just then footsteps enter the room.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
text: They're there. I can hear them.
dialog: Remember. Concentrate.
text: Bryan waits.
text: Kim waits.
text: Footsteps circle the room. Bryan can hear them, the waiting
text: is excruciating.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
text: Put the phone closer so I can hear.
text: Kim sees the shoes, sees them circle the bed. She holds her
text: breath. Hears voices in a language completely unfamiliar.
text: Bryan listens, not moving a muscle.
text: Kim watches the feet move towards the door.
text: Bryan hears the footsteps receding.
text: Kim sees the feet leave the room. She breathes out in
text: complete silence.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: (whispered)
dialog: They're leaving...
text: Bryan listens closely.
text: Kim begins to relax.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: (whispered)
dialog: I think they're...
text: And then a set of hands grab her legs, violently. She
text: screams.
speaker_heading: KIM
text: DADDYYYYYYY!! ir!
scene_heading: INT. BRYAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Kim's scream reverberates through the room, shaking the walls,
text: shocks Bryan. And even though it reaches into his very core,
text: he does not move. He calls on all his experience to stay
text: focused on the task. He listens to his daughter struggle.
dialog: And shout out...
speaker_heading: KIM V.O.
text: Mustache. Six feet.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: KIM V.O. (CONT'D)
text: Tattoo on right hand. Moon and
text: star...DADDDYYYY!!!! DADDDYYY!!!!!
text: The sound of glass shattering. And then her voice is
text: silenced. Bryan still does not move, sits very still,
dialog: listening...
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON
text: A hand takes Kim's phone from under the bed.
speaker_heading: ON BRYAN
text: He hears the sound of breathing coming over the speakers,
text: filling the room. After a moment...
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: I don't know who you are. I don't
dialog: know what you want. If you are
dialog: looking for a ransom, I can tell
dialog: you, I don't have money. But what I
dialog: do have are a very particular set of
dialog: skills acquired over a very long
dialog: career in the shadows, skills that
dialog: make me a nightmare for people like
dialog: you. If you let my daughter go now,
dialog: that will be the end of it. I will
dialog: not look for you, I will not pursue
dialog: you. But if you don't, I will look
dialog: for you, I will find you. And I
dialog: will kill you.
text: There is a long silence. Just breathing coming over the
dialog: line.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: (accented)
dialog: Good luck.
speaker_heading: ON BRYAN
text: Hearing the two words filling the room.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Good luck.
text: And then the shrill sound of a phone being smashed. The
text: line goes dead.
scene_heading: INT. BRYAN'S CAR - NIGHT
text: Bryan drives at breakneck speed, phone to his ear.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Sam, It's me.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: BRYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm going to download something. I
dialog: need it analyzed. Now.
text: Bryan plugs the recording device into his phone. Hits a
dialog: button.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. JAMES MANSION - NIGHT
text: The door opens to Lenore and Stuart, both roused from sleep.
text: Both very unnerved.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: She's been taken.
text: Bryan moves right past them. Man on a mission. Heads up
dialog: the stairs.
speaker_heading: LENORE
dialog: Oh my god!
text: Bryan keeps going. Lenore and Stuart follow.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Any enemies overseas Stuart?
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Why would I have...
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Because you do business overseas
dialog: through three shell corporations
dialog: registered to dead drop addresses in
dialog: Liechtenstein, Monaco and The Jersey
dialog: Islands. Because you were involved
text: in an oil deal with a bunch of
dialog: Russians that went south five years
dialog: ago.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: How the hell do you know...
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Because I was not going to let my
dialog: daughter live with someone without
dialog: knowing everything about them.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: I'm not without my sources too: OK?
dialog: Don't think you're the only one with
dialog: access to...
text: Bryan cuts him short, with the coldest voice he has ever
text: heard. A voice that shakes him.
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Now's not the time for dick measuring
dialog: Stuart. I'm going to ask you again.
dialog: Do you have anyone who would be
dialog: looking to hurt you?
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: (shaken)
dialog: Not that I know of.
text: Bryan comes to the top of the stairs, and half a dozen closed
dialog: doors.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Which one?
speaker_heading: LENORE
dialog: I want to know what happened!
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: I got a call from her, she said there
dialog: was someone in the apartment. Then
dialog: she was taken.
speaker_heading: LENORE
dialog: Oh my god! Bryan what are you going
dialog: to...?
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Every minute I stop to answer your
dialog: questions is a minute I lose in
dialog: getting her back. Which one Lenore?
speaker_heading: LENORE
dialog: That one.
text: She points to a door. Bryan goes through to...
scene_heading: INT. KIM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: The room of a rich girl, filled with all the accouterment.
text: Bryan begins a thorough search.
text: Bryan finds a picture of himself and five year old Kim buried
text: in a drawer. Pauses for a moment.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: What can I do?
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: You have a lease agreement with NetJet
dialog: through your Bahamian umbrella
dialog: company .
dialog: Stuart wonders: Is there anything Bryan does not know?
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: I do.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Get me a plane for Paris.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: For when?
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: An hour ago.
text: Exchanges a look with Lenore.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: T'll make the call.
text: Stuart exits.
text: Bryan continues searching, finds a condom in a drawer. Holds
dialog: it up.
speaker_heading: LENORE
dialog: I gave it to her.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Just in case.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: She's still a virgin. Are you going
dialog: to be able to save her?
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: First I have to find her.
text: Bryan's phone rings.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Got it?
text: He looks across the room to Kim's computer on her desk.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Yes. I have access.
text: Plugs the cell phone into the computer with a wire from his
text: pocket. The computer boots up fast. Sam comes on screen.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Go.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: They're speaking Albanian. The accent
dialog: comes from a district called Skopje.
text: The man speaking, his name is Marko.
text: The tattoo is a group ID.
text: Sam pauses.
dialog: 44.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Are you by yourself?
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Lenore's here.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Hi Lennie.
speaker_heading: LENORE
dialog: Hello Sam.
text: Again a pause.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: She needs to hear it Sam.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: The specialty of the gangs coming
dialog: out of there is trafficking in women.
text: Lenore gasps.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Keep going.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Their previous M.O. was to offer
dialog: women from the emerging East European
dialog: countries like Yugoslavia, Romania,
dialog: Bulgaria jobs in the West. Maids,
dialog: nannies. Once they smuggled them
dialog: in, they'd addict them to drugs and
dialog: turn them into prostitutes. Lately,
dialog: they've found it is more economical
dialog: to just kidnap young women traveling.
dialog: Saves on transportation costs.
text: Lenore lets out a strangled scream...
speaker_heading: LENORE
dialog: Oh god!
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: What else?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Based on what they know about the
dialog: way these groups operate, the analyst
dialog: Said you probably have a ninety six
dialog: hour window from the time she's
dialog: grabbed...
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: To what?
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: To never finding her.
text: Hits Bryan like a thunderbolt.
scene_heading: INT. PRIVATE JET - NIGHT
text: Bryan is the only passenger, he sits with the recording
text: device, listening to the recorded conversation with Kim.
dialog: Hears...
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Mustache...tattoo...moon and star...
text: Hears her screams. Fast forwards. Hears himself...
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: I don't know who you are. I don't
dialog: know what you want...
dialog: Fast forwards to...
speaker_heading: VOICE

speaker_heading: CONCTERGE
dialog: If you continue I will be obliged to
dialog: call the police.
text: Before the words are out of his mouth, Bryan knocks him out
text: with a well placed knuckle blow to his neck. He catches the
text: falling body, stepping through the open door.
scene_heading: INT. TWENTY RUE DE LA POMPE - PARIS ~ DAY
text: Bryan props the unconscious Concierge in his booth, heads
text: into the building itself.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
text: Bryan is at the door to the Morel apartment. He tries to

text: in the hall.
scene_heading: INT. AIR SHAFT - DAY
text: Bryan squeezes his body out the window into the air shaft,
text: scales his way across the narrow shaft, using every available
text: foot hold and hand hold.
text: Several times his hands slip, his feet lose their traction,
text: but bit by bit, he makes his way across the shaft until he
text: comes to a set of small windows.
text: Bryan punches out one of the panes, opens the window, squeezes
dialog: inside.
scene_heading: INT. PARIS APARTMENT - DAY
text: Bryan lands in the bathroom. Looks around, exits.
text: Bryan moves from room to room.

text: Of the chair being overturned as she struggles to break free.
speaker_heading: END FLASHES
text: Bryan moves through the apartment, taking everything in. He
text: sees the girl's luggage, untouched. Looks through both
text: suitcases. Moves on. Until he comes to...
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - MORNING
text: Bryan looks out the window across the open courtyard. He
text: switches on his tape recorder. Begins to hear what he is
dialog: seeing.
speaker_heading: FLASH
text: Sees what Kim saw. Three men grabbing a struggling Amanda.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON

speaker_heading: FLASH

speaker_heading: FLASH

speaker_heading: FLASH
text: Sees Kim lifted off her feet by an unseen man, and in her
text: struggle, has her head smashed into the mirror.
text: The sound is sickeningly loud. Bryan winces.
dialog: 48.
text: He approaches the mirror, examines the spot of impact. You
text: can feel his pain as he carefully removes a hair and some
text: dried blood, puts the samples in a bag.
text: His jaw tightens, his eyes turn murderous. And then he
text: notices something tossed in the corner: Kim's smashed cell
dialog: phone.
text: Bryan removes the chip from the back of the smashed phone,
dialog: examines it.
speaker_heading: CLOSE UP
text: The chip being inserted into a machine.
scene_heading: PULL BACK TO
scene_heading: INT. ELECTRONICS SHOP - DAY

text: airport, on the plane, in the Paris Airport.
text: Each picture is of one or the other. Except the last one,
text: where they are both mugging for the camera on the taxi line.
text: Bryan starts to manipulate the framing of the picture until
text: he catches a glimpse of a reflection in a security mirror of
text: the person taking the picture.
text: Bryan keeps manipulating the frame, discovering more and
text: more of the reflection, until a face appears, fuzzy, out of
dialog: focus.
text: Bryan keeps pushing buttons, until the entire reflection of
text: the person taking the picture comes clear: Peter.

scene_heading: EXT. TAXI STAND - PARIS AIRPORT - DAY

text: flirting. The girl is about to get in, when...
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Excuse me.
text: Bryan hustles Peter past the astonished girl, pushes him
text: into the cab, follows, slamming the door behind him.
scene_heading: INT. TAXI - DAY
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (struggling)
dialog: Hey! What are you...?
text: Bryan buries a sharp knuckle into his ribs, knocking the

speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: The two girl from yesterday.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I don't...
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: What are you doing?
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: BRYAN

speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: The next rib I drive into your lungs.
text: The Driver runs out of the car.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: The two girls. Where are they?
text: Suddenly, the door behind Bryan is yanked open and two large
text: black hands drag him out by his legs.
scene_heading: EXT. TAXI STAND - PARIS AIRPORT - DAY
text: Bryan hits the pavement hard. Before he can get up, the big
text: Black Guy pounds on him. Smashing him over and over.
text: Passengers run, screaming.
text: The Guy grabs Bryan, yanks him up like a sack of potatoes.
dialog: Except this sack of potatoes is a lethal weapon. Before the
text: guy knows what has happened, Bryan has grabbed his wrists,
text: ripped them down, bashed his forehead into the Guy's nose,
text: double punched him in his exposed throat.
text: The Guy falls, face gushing blood, hands grasping his throat,
text: unable to breathe.
text: Bryan turns back to the cab, only to find the other passenger
text: door open and Peter gone. Bryan sees Peter running up the
text: road, holding his damaged ribs.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Arretez! Arretez!
text: Bryan turns to see three police Officers running towards

text: Bryan leaps into the taxi, jams it into gear, rips a u turn
text: and rockets off after Peter.
scene_heading: EXT. ROADWAY - DAY
text: Peter runs, desperate to escape, his ribs on fire with every
text: breath. He looks over his shoulder, sees the taxi gaining

text: streaming down towards Bryan.
scene_heading: INT. TAXI - DAY
text: Through the windshield, Bryan sees Peter running up a ramp
text: that has nothing but cars coming at him.
dialog: 51.
text: Unable to negotiate the narrow ramp packed with oncoming
text: traffic, Bryan leaps out of the cab, blocking the road,
text: snarling traffic to a stand still.
scene_heading: EXT. ROADWAY - DAY
text: Bryan takes off at a dead run up the ramp, running against
text: the traffic, zig zagging through the cacophony of blaring
text: horns and irate drivers.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON
text: Peter. At the very top of the overpass. His breath coming
text: in jagged bursts, the pain in his side increasing with each
text: step. He looks back, sees Bryan gaining on him. Almost on
text: him. He is running out of room, out of breath. He looks
text: down to a roadway below, where the traffic is very sparse.
text: He looks back at Bryan, closing fast. Looks down at the
dialog: roadway. Makes a choice.
text: Jumps.
dialog: Lands.
text: Bryan reaches the top of the overpass, looks down. Peter
text: looks up at him, victorious, safe.
text: And then gets SLAMMED by a truck that comes out of nowhere

speaker_heading: JEAN-CLAUDE
dialog: Between you and me? No. But now

speaker_heading: BRYAN

speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Or how about all three? Sort of a

text: The car drives on.
speaker_heading: HOOKER

speaker_heading: BRYAN

text: she sees a car approaching.
speaker_heading: HOOKER
dialog: (scared)
dialog: Oh god! You better leave!
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: I thought we were negotiating!
text: The hooker steps back as a flashy SUV rolls up. A big,

text: side, approaches Bryan.
speaker_heading: HOOKER
dialog: Anton! I swear it's not my fault!
dialog: I told him to fuck off...

text: Anton puts a finger on her lips.
speaker_heading: ANTON

speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: (to Bryan)
dialog: Why are you bothering the girl?
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: What's it your business?
speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: She is my business.
text: He crowds Bryan, towering over him.
speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: And if you are not spending money,
dialog: you are costing money.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: I was negotiating.
speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: There is no negotiating. The price
dialog: is the price. And now you also owe
dialog: me for two that got away.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON
text: Gregor in the car. Watching the little drama, not
text: understanding what is going on.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: I don't owe you...
text: Anton grabs Bryan by the front of his jacket, slams him
text: against the wall. Bryan grabs onto the lapels of Anton's
dialog: jacket.
speaker_heading: CLOSE UP
text: Bryan's hand. Attaching a small, almost imperceptible, bug
text: on the inside of the lapel.
speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: Fifty euros or I kick your ass.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: OK, ..OK...
text: Bryan reaches into his pocket, extracts some bills.
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Here's fifty.
text: Anton grabs the bills, takes an additional few.
speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: And another fifty for being an
dialog: asshole.
text: He shoves Bryan hard.
speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: Now get the fuck out of here. I see
dialog: you again, I kill you.
text: Bryan stumbles away, hurrying off. Over his shoulder, Anton

scene_heading: INT. BRYAN'S CAR - NIGHT

speaker_heading: GREGOR
dialog: Mr. Smith. I do not know what kind

dialog: but...
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: You were hired to translate.
text: Bryan takes a device out of his bag.
speaker_heading: GREGOR
dialog: Yes. But translate what?
text: Bryan switches the device on. Voices start coming out.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: That.
text: They both look out the windshield as Anton is speaking to
text: the man driving the SUV. An astonished Gregor hesitates for
text: a moment.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Translate.
text: Gregor begins to translate.
speaker_heading: GREGOR
dialog: They are talking about you.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: What about me?
speaker_heading: GREGOR
dialog: They are saying not nice things.
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Be specific.
speaker_heading: GREGOR
dialog: They are saying, excuse me, what an

speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Keep going.
speaker_heading: GREGOR
dialog: The other is suggesting something
dialog: his grandmother used to give him for
dialog: the same thing.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Do you really want to hear all this?
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Every word.
speaker_heading: GREGOR
dialog: Now they are talking football. You
dialog: are American?
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: GREGOR
dialog: It is different from what we call
dialog: football here. We play with the
dialog: foot.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: I know that. Now what are they
dialog: saying?
speaker_heading: GREGOR
dialog: Still about football. They are
dialog: talking about the game between Lazio
dialog: and Marseilles. They lost money on
dialog: the betting.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: GREGOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Now they are talking about someone
dialog: they know who made fifty thousand on
dialog: one game and then lost it. Perhaps
dialog: if I knew what the purpose was...
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: You're better off not knowing. Is
dialog: it still football?
speaker_heading: GREGOR
text: One is on the phone. He has to go
dialog: to a job at the Freeway. Something
dialog: about the fresh merchandise giving
dialog: problems.
text: Bryan's eyes open, suddenly engaged.
speaker_heading: GREGOR
dialog: I don't understand any of this.
text: Bryan sees Anton's SUV pulling out down the street.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: You're not supposed to. Thank you.
text: Bryan leans over, opens Gregor's door.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Good bye.
text: Gregor looks at him askance, is about to exit the car.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: I asked for a English Albanian
dialog: dictionary. Did you bring it?
text: Gregor hands him a book.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Thank you.
text: Gregor exits the car. He is barely out, when Bryan jams his

scene_heading: EXT. PORTE DE CLICHY - NIGHT
text: Gregor watches as Bryan speeds away.
text: POV someone else also watching both Bryan and Gregor.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON
text: A figure, shrouded in shadows, in a car, watching through
text: the windshield.
dialog: 62.
scene_heading: EXT. FREEWAY CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT
text: A huge construction project operating twenty four hours a
text: day, seven days a week. With all the attendant mountains of
text: mud and grit and massive earth moving equipment.
text: Tons of earth is moved, tons of cement is produced, miles of
text: steel is welded. Day and night, the work never stops, shifts
text: of men come on, others go off. But the work never stops.
text: Giant cranes stand like creatures from another planet, moving
text: under the glare of oversized braces of construction lights.
text: Under which a hundred men labor at the backbreaking work of
dialog: highway construction.
text: Surreal is the only way to describe the scene.
text: Lining the shadowed perimeter of the site are rows and rows
text: of trailers, some offices, most dormitories, long mobile
text: caravans, housing the transitory work force of (mostly)
dialog: immigrant laborers.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON
text: Anton's SUV. Waits outside a very long trailer where thirty
text: workmen wait ina line to enter. A huge Albanian thug stands
text: guard at the door, a card board box next to him.
text: AS a man exits the trailer, buttoning up his work suit, he
text: hands a plastic card with a number on it to the Albanian,
text: who beckons the next man in the line to step forward. The
text: man hands him money, the Albanian hands him the number, and
text: a small towel from the cardboard box. The man steps into
dialog: the trailer.
text: A moment later Anton comes out, jokes with the Huge Albanian,
text: takes a wad of money from him and walks off towards his car.
text: As he passes the line of workers, one man close to the front
text: of the line, turns away. As Anton enters his car, he turns
text: back. It is Bryan. In worker's clothes. Two workers come
text: out of the trailer.
speaker_heading: ALBANIAN
dialog: Next ! .
text: Bryan and the man in front of him step up and take a number,
text: and a towel, enter the trailer.
scene_heading: INT. TRAILER - NIGHT
text: Bryan enters the trailer, and what he sees is: a long aisle
text: with five cubicles on either side. Long wires with blankets
text: hanging from them afford dubious privacy to each cubicle.
text: Numbers are pinned to each blanket.
dialog: 63.
text: Bryan looks at his number. Finds the corresponding blanket,
text: goes behind it. What he finds is a young girl, laying ona
text: cot with soiled sheets, drugged up, dulled, wearing nothing
text: but an unbuttoned blouse. Half a dozen discarded small towels
text: fill a small cardboard box in the corner. Next to the bed,
text: Bryan's eyes go to a bucket, with a half dozen used condoms
dialog: in it.
text: The girl looks up at Bryan, holds a condom up ina lazy,
text: indifferent hand, and mechanically spreads her legs. Bryan
text: Fights back his revulsion, retreats.
text: Back out in the corridor, Bryan collects himself, uses all
text: his will power to keep from throwing up, remembers why he is
text: there, goes to the next blanket, pulls it aside, sees...
text: Another girl laying on a cot, naked, with dull drugged eyes,
text: and a man just unbuttoning his pants.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Hey !
text: Bryan lets the blanket drop. He moves on to the next blanket,
text: pulls it aside to another dazed, naked girl, laying on a
text: soiled cot, and another man, just pulling his pants on, using
text: the towel to wipe himself off.
text: Bryan quickly withdraws.
text: Bryan pulls the next blanket aside: a man fucking yet another
text: girl, who just lays there, a far away glaze in her eyes,
text: while he pounds away.
text: Out in the corridor again, Bryan moves on. Pulls the next
text: blanket, finds a man about to mount another of the glazed
text: over girls, whose face he cannot see. Is about to withdraw
text: again, when he sees, on the floor by the bed, a Jean jacket,
text: with the word DOLLFACE, sequined on the back.
speaker_heading: FLASH
text: Bryan sees Kim rushing off with Amanda down the plane
text: concourse. The lights reflecting off the sequined word
text: DOLLFACE on the back of her jacket.
text: Bryan springs forward, grabs the man by the back of his shirt,
text: pulls him off the girl...
dialog: What the...???
text: Before another word can come out of his mouth, Bryan has
text: knocked him out with a sharp blow to the jaw.
text: Bryan turns immediately to the girl expecting to find Kin,
text: but instead finds a complete stranger.
dialog: 64,
text: Bryan lifts the jean jacket to the girl's unfocused eyes.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Where did you get this?
text: The girl looks at him, uncomprehending. Bryan sees a series
text: of fresh needle tracks on her arms. Her response is to hold
text: up a condom, spread her legs. Bryan takes the soiled sheet
text: and covers her.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Where did you get this?
text: Trying to get her to focus.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: (garbled)
dialog: I am good...
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Who gave it to you?
text: The girl lapses into her drugged state.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Who gave this to you?
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: I am good...
text: Suddenly, the blanket is ripped aside, and the Huge Albanian
text: is standing there. Before he can say a word, Bryan has lashed
text: out with a kick that sends him staggering back.
text: The Albanian falls back, crashes into the blankets on the
text: other side of the corridor, grasps onto the wire holding the
text: blankets, pulls down the whole row.
text: The men behind the blankets start to yell. The naked girls
text: begin to stir from their dazed states.
text: Bryan gets the girl up, grabs her discarded clothes.
text: The Albanian rises from the floor, draws a gun from his
text: jacket, is about to fire, when Bryan takes the bed sheet and
text: whips it toward his hand. The gun flies from his hand.
text: Men leap from the cubicles, pulling on their clothes, running
text: for the exit. The girls rise and stagger about, lost, stoned.
text: The Albanian charges Bryan. Bryan side steps and with three
text: lethal moves puts the man out for good. He then turns back
text: to the girl, lifts her from the bed |
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: I am good...
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Yes you are. Now come on. I'm going
dialog: to take you someplace safe.
text: Bryan gets the jacket around her. She can barely stand.
text: He starts to head for the door, shepherding the girl through
text: the crowd of naked, stoned women, wobbling around, through
text: the men rushing for the exit. When three more Albanians
text: come charging through the door. Seeing the chaos, they key
text: on Bryan and the girl under his arm. They attack.
text: Bryan puts the girl aside and meets the first attack,
text: dispatching the man with one chop to the throat, he spins
text: into the second, with a palm hand to the nose. The third
text: has drawn his gun, fires, hits a woman in front of Bryan.
text: As her chest explodes, Bryan leaps, takes the man out with a
text: Flying kick.
scene_heading: INT. ANOTHER TRAILER - NIGHT
text: Anton and three other Albanian thugs are playing cards, when
text: they hear the gunshot.
scene_heading: INT. TRAILER - NIGHT
text: Bryan runs back for the girl, who has now gone unconscious.
text: He lifts her in his arms, heads for the exit.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT
text: Workers are running off into the night, half a dozen stoned
text: women are wandering about.
text: Bryan hustles the girl out, and into the back seat of an
text: SUV. He lays her down, straps her in with both sets of seat
text: belts, is about to hop in the front seat, when he sees a can
text: of gasoline by the side of a shed.
text: Bryan tears the sleeve off his construction outfit, stuffs
text: it into the top of the can, lights the make shift fuse, takes
text: a running start and flings the can with all his might. The
text: can sails through the air, rag/fuse leaving a flaming trail
text: behind. The can hits the trailer, explodes.
text: The security men, the gathered construction workers, even
text: some of the stoned girls, jump as the entire trailer goes up
text: in flames.
text: A REAL ATTENTION GETTER THAT.
text: Bryan is about to get into the SUV, when a shot shatters the
text: Side window. He looks up to four very banged up construction
text: Site SUV's's, led by Anton's unblemished one, racing towards
dialog: him. |
dialog: 66.
text: Anton hangs out the window, fires his gun at Bryan. Who
text: jumps into the SUV, takes off.
scene_heading: EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT
text: The banged up SUV's push past Anton's , training their
text: headlights on Bryan's vehicle. Anton's SUV veers off, out
dialog: of sight.
text: Bryan races across the muddied rutted terrain, with the SUV's
text: racing after him like a pack of predatory jackals. One of
text: the SUV's shoots past the others, comes right up on Bryan's
dialog: rear,
text: Bryan looks in his rear view mirror, sees the man in the SUV
text: pulling a gun,
text: Bryan turns the wheel sharply, heads down an impossibly steep
text: grade, spewing gravel and mud.
text: The SUV jumps off the grade, follows.
text: Bryan's car veers sideways as he struggles to control the
text: wheel. The SUV gains on him. Bryan sees the grade bottoming
text: out, spins the wheel so the car is straight. As he hits the
text: bottom, he hits the brakes hard. Stops abruptly. The SUV
text: so close, does not anticipate. Smashes right into the rear
text: of Bryan's car. The driver flies right through his
text: windshield, shattering both the window and his face.
text: Bryan guns the SUV, takes off again because the other two
text: SUV's have come around the side of the grade and are closing
text: fast. Bryan looks ahead, sees up above on a plateau, four
text: Massive earth movers pushing tons of dirt and rock down into
dialog: a depression.
text: Bryan races right towards the landslide about to happen.
text: The SUV's race to catch him.
text: Bryan keeps watching the movement up above. Slows down just
text: enough for the SUV's to come closer, maneuvers right under
text: the landslide of earth coming down.
text: The dirt starts to hit his windshield, making visibility
text: precarious. He slows even more. Checks the SUV's in the
text: mirror, sees the men on them pulling their guns, not looking
text: up, just intent on their prey.
text: And then, just as the SUV's have Bryan in range, a rumbling
text: distracts them and they see a landslide of earth coming down.
text: Bryan guns his SUV, rockets just ahead of the massive slide,
text: driving blind in the cascading debris and dirt.
text: The SUV's, caught in the middle of the slide, unprotected by
text: glass and steel, are doomed.
dialog: 67.
text: The first earth hits them, blinds them, and then buries them.
text: Bryan drives blind, but manages to come out the other side
dialog: of the slide.
text: Only to see, right in front of him, bearing down, Anton in
text: his SUV, leaning out his window, firing his gun.
text: Bryan's windshield takes two hits; Anton's SUV shows no signs
text: of slowing. To avoid the head on collision, Bryan veers off
text: to the left. Anton skids hard, follows.
text: Bryan races into a series of cranes lifting large steel beams.
text: Anton follows him.
text: Spinning his wheel around the giant cranes and their swinging
text: loads, Bryan kicks up mud and gravel, splattering Anton's
text: windshield, making it hard for him to see.
text: Bryan sees a load of steel beams being lifted off the ground,
text: swinging left to right. He cuts hard around them. Tips
text: them with his front fender. The beams spin around fast.
text: Anton, barely able to see through the debris and mud
text: splattering on his windshield, does not see the beam end
text: that crashes through his windshield, until it is too late.
text: It crushes his chest.
text: Bryan looks back, sees the beam jammed through Anton's
text: windshield, looks over at the back seat at the unconscious
dialog: girl.
text: Sirens are sounding in the distance. Bryan looks up and
text: sees the flashing lights of police cars approaching. He
text: drives off in the opposite direction.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON
text: A car parked in the shadows. The driver watching, puts his
text: car in gear, follows Bryan.

speaker_heading: END FLASH
text: Bryan looks in his rear view mirror, sees the car that has
text: been following him is two car lengths behind.
text: Bryan looks up ahead, sees a traffic light turning red, sees
text: two cars ahead of him.
text: Just as the light turns red, Bryan accelerates, cuts around
text: the two cars between him and the light, makes a tire
text: screeching u turn, cutting off the traffic coming the other
text: way, heads up the other side of the avenue, sees the car
text: that has been following, caught, trapped. Sees the driver,

speaker_heading: FLASH
text: Held down by three men, struggling, she is handcuffed to a

speaker_heading: FLASH
text: A man fucks the handcuffed girl as she lays in a semi

speaker_heading: FLASH
text: The same thing occurs in rapid succession. Shot administered,
dialog: men fucking her.
speaker_heading: GIRL
text: Over and over.
text: She begins to cry.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: I am good girl...
text: Bryan is shaken to his very core. He wipes the girl's tears.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: What about her?
text: Holds up Kim's picture.
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: What about this girl?
speaker_heading: FLASH
text: The girl lays on a bed shaking. Kim is pushed into the room.
text: Kim sees her pitiful state, lays her jacket over the girl.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Did they...
text: He can't even bring himself to think about the possibility.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: What happened to her?
speaker_heading: FLASH
text: Kim, drugged, semi conscious, is held down on the bed, her

speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Do you know where the house is?
speaker_heading: GIRL

speaker_heading: FLASH
text: The girl is in a car, under the influence of drugs, her eyes

speaker_heading: RUE PARADIS
scene_heading: EXT. RUE PARADIS - DAY
text: A house with a red door, just like any other house on the
text: street, innocuous, well kept, quiet, set back from the street.
text: On the small porch, two Albanian thugs play cards, come to
dialog: attention when...
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Good morning.
text: Cleaned up, looking very official in a suit, enters the yard.
speaker_heading: ALBANIAN
dialog: I help you?
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: I'm here to see your boss.
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: ALBANTAN
dialog: No boss.
text: Bryan hands him the card he took from Jean-Claude. The thug
text: looks at it. Is a bit taken aback.
speaker_heading: ALBANIAN
dialog: We are doing nothing wrong here.
text: Bryan takes out his cell phone, has his finger poised over
text: the keypad.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: I push one button and thirty agents
dialog: will be here before you can scratch
dialog: your worthless balls. Now stop
dialog: fucking around, before I shut you
dialog: down for wasting my time.
speaker_heading: ALBANIAN
dialog: (rattled)
dialog: Wait here.
text: He enters the house, leaving Bryan under the watchful eye of
text: his cohort. Bryan scans the house, taking note of the
dialog: details: windows, doors, utilities.
text: The first thug reappears.
speaker_heading: ALBANIAN
dialog: You have weapon?
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: You're holding it.
text: He alludes to the card.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE - DAY
text: Bryan is led down a narrow hallway toward the kitchen. On
text: the way, he passes a room where four men are playing cards.
text: He passes a staircase, where a man is descending, buttoning
text: his pants, another is ascending. Bryan looks past the man
text: descending, to the top of the stairs. Then he locks eyes
dialog: with the man.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: (challenging)
dialog: What?
text: It is all Bryan can do to reach up and rip his throat out.
text: But he doesn't. He moves on.
dialog: 76.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
text: The Man who led him in stands by the stove. Four other
text: Albanians sit at a table drinking coffee. All have mustaches,
text: all have tattoos of a crescent and a star on their right
text: hand between the thumb and the forefinger.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Black, one sugar, please.
text: Alludes to the coffee pot. One of the men at the table nods
text: to the thug who brought Bryan in. He gets the coffee.
speaker_heading: MAN 1
dialog: What is it you want?
text: He speaks with a lisp.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: I'm here to negotiate the rates.
speaker_heading: MAN 1
dialog: We have already negotiated the rates
dialog: with Mr. Macon.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
text: Mr. Macon has moved to another
dialog: division. I am here for the re
dialog: negotiation.
text: The Men say nothing, look at each other, then back at Bryan,
text: who takes a sip of the coffee.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Very nice coffee.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Unless you think I am being
dialog: unreasonable, let me explain our
dialog: position. We have you under satellite
dialog: surveillance twenty four hours a
dialog: day.
text: The Men all look up to the ceiling, out the windows.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: We hear everything you say, we know
dialog: everything you do. Do you have any
dialog: idea what it cost just to change the
text: angle of the lens on a satellite
dialog: orbiting 200 miles above the Earth?
dialog: And those costs have gone up. Our
dialog: costs go up, your costs go up. It
dialog: is only logical.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: By the way, which one of you is Marko?
dialog: He speaks
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: MAN 2
dialog: Why do you want to know?
text: with a very high voice.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: I was told Marko is in charge.
speaker_heading: MAN 1
dialog: We are all Marko.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Marko from Skopje.
speaker_heading: MAN 2
dialog: We are all from Skopje.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: If that is the game you want to play,
dialog: the rate just went up ten percent.
speaker_heading: MAN 2
dialog: If you are trying to make extortion
dialog: on us because we are immigrants, we
dialog: know the law.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: I am extorting you because you are
dialog: breaking the law. Now which charge
dialog: would you like to be arrested for?
dialog: The drugs? The kidnapping? Or the
dialog: prostitution?
text: The men look from one to the other.
dialog: Again the
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: You come to our country, take
dialog: advantage of our system, and think
dialog: because we are tolerant, we are weak,
dialog: and helpless. Your arrogance offends
dialog: me. And for that, the rate just
dialog: went up another ten percent.
text: men trade a look.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: You want to get down to business?
dialog: Or you want to keep playing?
text: The atmosphere grows more tense by the moment. Bryan stares
text: at the Albanians, the Albanians stare back. The thug behind
dialog: Bryan has
text: his hand tucked into his coat. Then the tension
text: is broken by...
speaker_heading: MAN 1
dialog: How much?
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Better. Twenty percent.
text: The Man blinks.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: And you have my word it will not go
dialog: up
dialog: (beat )
dialog: For a year.
text: Bryan goes to scoop sugar in his coffee from a pot on the
text: table. Addresses the third man.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: How do you say sugar in your language?
speaker_heading: MAN 3
dialog: (Albanian)
dialog: sugar.
text: His voice is very deep. Bryan repeats the word.
speaker_heading: MAN 1
dialog: And what does the extra twenty percent
dialog: buy us?
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: It buys you the future.
text: Again the men look at each other. Man 1 pulls out a wad of
text: bills, counts some bills, puts them on the table.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: You've made a very good investment.
text: He takes the money, pockets it, finishes his coffee...
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: See you in a month.
text: Gets up to go. Then, as if forgetting something, he takes a
text: piece of paper out of his pocket, the paper he copied words
text: on from the Albanian dictionary. He turns to the fourth
text: man, who has said nothing.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: A friend gave this to me. It's
dialog: Albanian. You mind translating it
dialog: for me?
text: The man stares at the paper, suspicious, looks at the others.
text: The others shrug. He reads from the paper, translates...
speaker_heading: MAN 4
dialog: Good luck.
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: FLASH
text: The mustached mouth saying:
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Good luck.
speaker_heading: FLASH
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Good luck.
text: Into Kim's phone. Same voice. Being replayed on Bryan's
dialog: recorder over and over:
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Good luck.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: You don't remember me.
text: Marko looks at him, uncomprehending.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: We spoke on the phone three days
dialog: ago.
text: Marko doesn't understand.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: I told you I would find you.
text: Now Marko remembers. He reaches into his jacket. In the
text: flash of an eye, before he can get his weapon out, Bryan
text: lashes out, chops his throat.
text: The other men go for their weapons. But Bryan is like
text: lightning. He grabs the two knives from a plate where they
text: were previously cutting sausage and cheese, flings them
dialog: simultaneously.
text: One knife catches one man in the heart, the other man through
dialog: the eye.
text: The third man has his gun out. Bryan breaks his neck before
dialog: he can get a shot off. |
text: Bryan takes the gun. Deliberately fires a shot into the
dialog: ceiling.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE - DAY
text: In the front room, the men playing cards hear the shot.
dialog: 80.
scene_heading: INT. UPSTAIRS - DAY
text: Two men come running out of rooms, pulling up their pants,
text: pulling out their guns.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - DAY
text: The men from the front room come rushing in to find bodies,
text: blood everywhere. But before they can understand that there
text: is one more body than there were men in the room, one of the
text: bodies rises.
text: Bryan shoots so fast, the men are dead before they know it.
text: Bryan heads out of the kitchen.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
text: The two men from upstairs come running down the stairs, run
text: to the kitchen. Find the bodies. Hear a noise of feet
text: running up stairs behind them.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
text: The two men come running back the way they came, the footsteps
text: still sounding on the stairs.
text: As they turn the corner to head up the stairs, they come
text: face to face with Bryan, stamping his feet on the stairs in
text: the cadence of someone walking. Their momentary surprise is
dialog: ail he needs to shoot them dead.
text: Bryan turns and heads up the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. UPSTAIRS ~- DAY
text: Cautiously, Bryan comes to a line of closed doors. His nerves
text: keening, he moves forward to the first door. He opens it
text: slowly. Finds a half naked woman, out of it on drugs,
text: handcuffed to a bed.
text: He opens another door. Finds another girl in the same
dialog: condition.
text: His stomach knotting, he opens a third door. In the dim
text: light, Bryan cannot make out the face. The woman bears a
dialog: Similarity to Kim,
text: Bryan hurries over to her, turns her head into the light.
dialog: It is not Kim.
text: Bryan rushes out.
text: IN A SERIES OF QUICK CUTS:
text: Bryan knocks down door after door, finding naked, drugged,
text: bound women in various states of ravaged. None of them is
dialog: Kim.
dialog: B81.
text: Bryan kicks down one last door, and finds...
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Amanda !
text: Amanda, hands tied to a post behind the bed, her eyes open,
text: staring into eternity. Foam drips out of the corner of her
text: slack mouth. A syringe is still inserted in her arm. She
text: is dead. A BLUR comes into focus.
speaker_heading: CLOSE UP
text: Kim's picture.
scene_heading: PULL BACK TO
text: Marko's face. Staring at Kim's picture.
scene_heading: PULL BACK FURTHER
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT - DAY
text: Light seeps in through the floor boards, creating a mix of
text: light and shadow.
text: Marko is trussed, spread eagled, naked on a rack that looks
text: like some sort of S&M sex device. Two wires run from his
text: groin to a light switch on the wall. Bryan's hand is on the
dialog: switch.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Where is she?
speaker_heading: MARKO
dialog: Fuck you.
text: Bryan sticks a cloth in Marko's mouth, his hand hits the
text: switch. A bare bulb goes on, flickers with the flow of
dialog: current.
text: Marko shrieks into the cloth, in absolute agony, as current
text: flows through his gonads.
text: Bryan turns the switch off. The room goes back into shadows
text: and strips of light.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: (calm)
dialog: You know we used to out source this
dialog: sort of thing. But what we found
dialog: was the countries we out sourced to
dialog: had unreliable power grids. Very
dialog: third world. Sometimes you'd turn
dialog: the switch on, there'd be no power
dialog: for hours.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: BRYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: And then tempers would get short,
dialog: people would resort to things like
text: pulling finger nails, acid drips on
dialog: bare skin. The whole exercise would
dialog: become...counter productive. But
dialog: here the power is stable, there's a
dialog: nice even flow. Here you can flip a
dialog: switch and the power stays on all
dialog: day.
text: He takes the cloth out of Marko's mouth.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Where is she?
speaker_heading: MARKO
dialog: I don't know.
text: Bryan stuffs the rag back in Marko's mouth, hits the switch,
text: leaves it on. Marko screams in unimaginable agony.
text: Bryan flips the switch off. Marko has snot running from his
text: nose, saliva from his mouth.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Now I don't have any more time to
dialog: waste Marko from Skopje. You either
dialog: give me what I need, or this switch
dialog: will stay on until they turn the
dialog: power off for lack of payment on the
dialog: bill. Where is my daughter?
speaker_heading: MARKO
dialog: (weakly)
dialog: We do not keep virgin. We sell them.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: You sold my daughter?
text: Marko nods.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: To who?
speaker_heading: MARKO
dialog: I don't know.
text: Bryan goes to stuff the rag back in his mouth.
speaker_heading: MARKO
dialog: St. Clair!
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: St. Clair. Is that a person? A
dialog: place?
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: MARKO |
dialog: St. Clair. St. Clair. Person.
dialog: Patrice St. Clair!
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Where do I find this person Patrice
dialog: St. Clair?
speaker_heading: MARKO
dialog: Don't know.
text: Bryan's hand goes to the switch.
speaker_heading: MARKO
dialog: Don't know! Don't know! Please!
dialog: Don't know!
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: I believe you.
text: He gives Marko a pat on the back.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: But it's not going to save you.
text: He does not bother to put the rag in Marko's mouth, just
text: hits the switch. The light bulb keeps flickering.
text: Bryan walks out of the room to the most horrendous screams
dialog: ever to come from a human throat.

speaker_heading: TSABELLE
dialog: Jean!
speaker_heading: JEAN - CLAUDE |
dialog: My salary is X. My expenses are Y.
dialog: I do not know where the difference
dialog: between the two comes from. As long
dialog: as my family is provided for, I do
dialog: not care where the difference comes
dialog: from. That is my entire involvement.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: And what about my family Jean?
speaker_heading: JEAN - CLAUDE

dialog: 87.
text: Bryan opens his hand, drops the bullets from the gun on the
dialog: table.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: No I'm not.
text: Jean-Claude pulls the trigger. Click click.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: That's what happens when you sit
dialog: behind a desk. You stop paying
dialog: attention to the details. You forget
text: things. Like the weight in the hand
text: of a gun that is loaded and one that
dialog: is not.
text: In the flash of an eye, Bryan takes out his own gun. Shoots
text: Isabelle in the shoulder. She falls to the floor screaming.
text: Jean-Claude goes to move. Bryan takes him to the table with
text: an immobilizing arm lock, presses the gun to his head.
speaker_heading: JEAN - CLAUDE

speaker_heading: BRYAN

speaker_heading: PULL BACK
text: To Jean-Claude at his home computer with Bryan over his
text: shoulder. As the dossier rolls out on the screen...
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: You could have made this much less

dialog: Please.
text: Bryan opens the bottle. Begins to pour.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I have two...
text: From his vantage point, Bryan can see several other rooms
text: just like the one he is in facing the stage. A voice comes
text: over a loudspeaker.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Sold for Two hundred thousand.
text: Applause comes from behind the walls. The window goes black.
text: Ali makes a note ina book. Dials on his cell, speaks in
dialog: Arabic.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: The last item.
text: The light comes on. Ali's attention turns to the window
text: where the next girl is brought in. He drains his glass,
text: holds it out for another pour, not taking his eyes off the
text: window. Bryan pours, but also keeps his eyes on the window.
text: As before, the girl is wearing a silk robe, her back is to

text: He hopes against hope.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Hey!
text: Bryan looks down, sees he has poured over the rim of the
text: glass, soaked Ali's sleeve.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Get out.
text: He pays Ali no mind. Because his worst nightmare has come
text: true. The robe is removed, the girl is turned. Standing
text: there, with dulled drugged eyes, naked, for sale to the
dialog: highest bidder, is Kim.
text: The music comes on, Kim, prodded by the man behind her, starts
text: to dance listlessly.
speaker_heading: ALT
dialog: I said...
text: Bryan pulls a gun. Puts it right to Ali's forehead.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: I heard what you said. Buy her.
text: Ali hesitates.
speaker_heading: VOICE

text: A moment.
speaker_heading: VOICE

speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: You will never get away with this.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: If you want to live, you'll make
dialog: sure I do. Move.
text: He pushes Ali toward the door.
scene_heading: INT. CIRCULAR HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: The door opens. Ali exits, Bryan right behind him. Because
text: the walls are curved, Bryan has no field of vision. No sooner
text: has Bryan stepped out, then two blackjacks from both sides
text: of the curved wall come crashing down on his head.
scene_heading: INT. MECHANICAL SHOP - NIGHT
text: Bryan's vision clears. He finds himself in a tool shop,
text: handcuffed to an overhead pipe, facing four Security men
dialog: and...
scene_heading: ST. CLAIR
dialog: Now Mr...
text: He looks at Bryan's fake ID...
scene_heading: ST. CLAIR
dialog: Well, we know you are not Mr. Jean-
dialog: Claude.
text: He holds up the ID, peels Bryan's picture off.
dialog: 93.
scene_heading: sT. CLAIR
dialog: So what do we call you?
text: Bryan says nothing.
scene_heading: ST. CLAIR
dialog: Doesn't matter what we call you
dialog: really. What does matter is what
dialog: you are doing here. Would you care
dialog: to tell me what you are doing here?
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: The last girl. I'm her father.
text: This causes some disquiet among the men.
scene_heading: ST. CLAIR
dialog: Oh my.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Give her to me.
scene_heading: ST. CLAIR
dialog: IT wish I could, honestly. I'ma
text: father also. Two sons and a daughter.
dialog: But let me explain something to you
dialog: Mr...whoever you are. This is a
dialog: business. A very unique business
dialog: with a very unique clientele.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: T'll pay.
scene_heading: ST. CLAIR
dialog: In this business there are no refunds,
dialog: no returns, no discounts, no buy
dialog: backs. All sales are final. Besides
dialog: discretion, it is the only rule we
dialog: have. As a father, my heart goes
dialog: out to you. It really does. Asa
dialog: businessman, I must accept the
dialog: reality. I'm sorry.
text: St. Clair turns to go.
speaker_heading: SECURITY
dialog: What should we do with him?
text: At the door...
scene_heading: ST. CLAIR
dialog: Kill him.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Quietly. I have guests.
text: St. Clair exits with one of the Security men. The other
text: three men look at each other. }
dialog: 94.
text: Then at Bryan, who glares at them.
speaker_heading: MAN 1
dialog: Gag him.
text: Man 3 takes out a cloth, the other two take out knives. Man
text: 3 advances on Bryan. As he gets within range, Bryan pulls
text: down with all his might on the pipe he is handcuffed to,
text: snaps it. The open pipe spews a blast of steam right into
text: Man 3's face. He staggers back, blinded, scalded.
text: Steam begins to fill the room. Man 2 rushes Bryan, leading
text: with his knife. Bryan wraps the handcuffs around his forearm,
text: spins halfway, breaks his arm.
text: When, from behind, Man 1 pulls a garrote tight around Bryan's
text: throat. Bryan reverses fast, gets his handcuffs around the
text: man's neck, pulls hard, snaps his neck like a twig.
text: Man 3 has recovered and charges Bryan with his knife drawn.
text: Bryan reverses him with a swift deflection and drives him
text: forward, right into the dangling steam pipe. The pipe pierces
text: his back and protrudes through his chest; blood sprays in
text: every direction. As he dies, steam shoots out of the pipe.
text: Bryan reaches over, removes a gun from the holster of one of
text: the dead men, shoots the handcuffs off.
scene_heading: INT. GARAGE - NIGHT
text: St. Clair is waiting for the lift, when he hears the shot.
speaker_heading: ST. CLATR
dialog: Would you please go and see which
dialog: part of the word quietly they did
dialog: not understand?
speaker_heading: SECURITY
dialog: Yes sir.
text: The Security Man heads back toward the rear door, when the
text: door swings open and a burst of steam envelops him. Out of
text: the steam a gun fires, blowing a hole in his face.
text: St. Clair stares, stunned, as Bryan emerges from the steam,
text: armed. Fire in his eyes.
scene_heading: ST. CLAIR
dialog: (panicked)
dialog: We can resolve this.
text: Bryan says nothing, keeps advancing. St. Clair backs up
text: against the lift door.
scene_heading: ST. CLAIR
dialog: I know how you feel. We should talk.
dialog: We'll work it out.
dialog: 95.
text: The lift door opens, St. Clair stumbles in , tries to push
text: the button. Bryan fires one shot, wounding him in his
text: shoulder. St. Clair slumps against the wall, Bryan stands
text: over him.
scene_heading: ST. CLAIR
dialog: You have no idea...
text: Bryan puts a bullet in his other shoulder. St. Clair screams.
text: Bryan aims the gun at his leg.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Where is she?
scene_heading: ST. CLAIR
dialog: Please you must try to understand...
text: Bryan puts a bullet in his leg.
scene_heading: ST. CLAIR
dialog: There's a boat by the quay! Please
dialog: understand. It was all business.
dialog: It wasn't personal.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: To you it was all business. To me
dialog: it was all personal.
text: He pumps the entire clip of bullets into St. Clair. Presses
text: the lift button. The doors close. The lift rises.
scene_heading: INT. MANSION - NIGHT
text: The guests are mingling, chatting, being so pleasantly social,
text: when the lift arrives, opens, and St. Clair's lifeless, bloody
text: body topples out. A real party ender.
scene_heading: EXT. MANSION - NIGHT
text: Guests are rushing out of the mansion, hampering the Security
text: men trying to rush in.
dialog: Suddenly...
speaker_heading: CRASH!
text: One of the luxury cars from the garage comes smashing through
text: the garage doors to the side of the main building, Bryan
text: behind the wheel.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - NIGHT
text: Bryan veers off, avoiding hitting the people scurrying around.
text: The Security draw guns, try to get a bead on him, but Bryan
text: jerks the car to the left, without taking his foot off the
text: accelerator, sending the car crashing through a high hedge.
dialog: 96.
scene_heading: EXT. GARDENS - NIGHT
text: Bryan races the car through the formal gardens of the mansion,
text: destroying a large fountain, tearing up the plantings,
text: obliterating several benches and a glass gazebo, smashing
text: through the wall surrounding the whole estate, before he
text: careens onto the road.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - NIGHT
text: Bryan emerges onto the top of the Avenue, sees in the
text: distance, on the river below, a grand boat, built in the
text: Twenties, made all of wood and gleaming chrome, lit up, with
text: several cars approaching.
text: Bryan hits the accelerator, takes a road to the lower quai.
scene_heading: EXT. BOAT - NIGHT
text: Ali and his bodyguards bring Kim and two other drugged out
text: girls onto the boat. More bodyguards greet them on deck.
scene_heading: EAT. SMALL QUAI - NIGHT
text: Bryan races along the river on the lower roadway, sees that
text: the boat has left the quai and moved out into the river.
text: Bryan screeches to a stop as the road dead ends, throws the
text: Car into reverse, goes barreling up the road the way he came.
scene_heading: KAT. ROADWAY - NIGHT
text: On the top of the roadway, traffic runs in the opposite
text: direction. Out of nowhere, Bryan's car blows out of the
text: lower roadway and onto the high quai road. AGAINST THE FLOW
speaker_heading: OF TRAFFIC,
text: Cars screech, bang into each other. Bryan sees from his
text: vantage point that the boat has pulled away from the quai
text: and is starting to head out into the river.
text: Bryan jams the gear shift into low, and takes off after the
text: boat. AGAINST THE FLOW OF TRAFFIC.
text: TRACK WITH Bryan as he races against the traffic, keeping
text: one eye on the boat cruising in the middle of the river, and
text: the other eye on the cars trying to get out of his way as he
text: barrels full speed right at them.
text: Cars careen left and right, slamming into each other, running
text: up on the shoulders of the road, taking out lampposts, guard
dialog: rails.
text: Bryan pulls even with the boat, still racing headlong into
text: the traffic. Oblivious to the mayhem he is causing, he looks
text: over toward the boat, see several crewmen on deck, but no
text: Sign of Ali or Kim.
dialog: 97.
scene_heading: INT. BOAT - NIGHT
text: Ali enters a stateroom where an older man in Traditional
text: robes, SHEIKH RAHMAN, is reclining on a huge bed.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: (Arabic)
dialog: They are being prepared sir.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - NIGHT
text: Bryan races down the road until he comes to a bridge ahead
text: of the boat. He brakes hard, gets out, and starts running
text: to the center of the bridge.
text: He perches right at the rail, waiting for the boat to come
dialog: closer.
text: On the quai road, the sound of police sirens and the sight
text: of flashing lights heading right towards him draws Bryan's
text: attention for a moment.
scene_heading: INT. BOAT - NIGHT
text: Ali, walking along a corridor hears the noise outside, peers
text: out a window, sees the police cars rushing up the quai, thinks
text: nothing of it, heads for a door at the end of the hall.
scene_heading: INT. BRIDGE - NIGHT
text: Bryan watches the boat passing underneath the bridge some
text: thirty fee below. He takes a breath, jumps.
scene_heading: INT. ROOM - NIGHT
text: Ali watches as two Arabic women are dressing Kim and the two
text: other spaced out girls in very chic, but very revealing gowns.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Show time!
text: And then he hears a loud thump on the deck above.
scene_heading: EXT. BOAT - NIGHT
text: Bryan has hit the deck hard, injuring his ankle. Taking a
text: moment to collect himself, he looks up to see three crewmen
text: running towards him, two have clubs, the third a shovel.
text: Bryan manages to find his feet just as they attack.
text: The first man swings his club. Bryan disarms him, crippling
text: him with a blow to the throat. He raises the club just as
text: the shovel comes crashing down, blocking the sharp edge of
text: it and driving the club into the man's jaw in one swift move.
dialog: 98.
text: The third man catches him with the club across the back.
text: Bryan buckles a bit from the blow. The man is about to land
text: another, when Bryan kicks out from the floor, shattering the
text: man's knee.
text: The man goes down, screaming in pain. Bryan puts him out of
text: his misery with a reverse elbow strike to the face.
scene_heading: INT. BOAT - CORRIDOR - NIGHT
text: Ali moves through the corridor, the three dazed girls being
text: hustled along by two other men, when he sees, through the
text: narrow window above him, a man hitting the deck, blood
text: spurting from his mouth.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: You!
text: He motions to one man.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: Come with me!
text: Motions to the other.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: You deliver the girls!
text: Ali and one of the men run off.
scene_heading: EXT. BOAT - NIGHT
text: Bryan makes his way along the deck, favoring his injured
text: ankle, when suddenly a door opens behind him and two men
text: rush out, one with an ax, the other with a machete.
text: Bryan grabs the only weapon available: the oar from a life
dialog: boat.
text: Bryan battles both men, skillfully using the oar to deflect
text: the blows from the ax and the machete, spinning, feinting,
text: blocking, striking, until the man with the machete snaps the
text: Oar in two with one downward cut.
text: Just then the man with the ax swings at Bryan. Bryan blocks
text: the blow with one end of the oar, jams the jagged other end
text: into his chest. In one swift circular move, Bryan grabs the
text: ax, Spins, and buries the blade into the chest of the machete
dialog: wielder.
text: Bryan hears a noise behind him, turns just as two more men
text: emerge, firing guns. Bryan pulls the man he just axed in
text: Front of him. The bullets riddle his body.
text: Bryan spins with the corpse, grabbing the machete, swinging
text: down at the shooter's hands. Chops one man's hand clean
text: off. Severs the second shooter's throat.
dialog: 99.
text: Another man emerges from the cabin, spraying with an
text: automatic. Bryan pushes the corpse into him, clambers up
text: and over the cabin roof.
text: ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DECK
text: Bryan drops back down onto the deck, his ankle crumbling
text: underneath him. He rises, painfully, only to find another
text: three crew, armed with clubs, and knives, charging.
text: The first man attacks with a knife. Bryan lets the knife
text: pass inches from his side, then spins the man and drives the
text: knife into the second man who is charging right behind him.
text: The third man swings down with his club, catches Bryan on
text: the shoulder, sends him staggering almost over the side of
dialog: the boat.
text: The Clubber swings again, Bryan rolls over the rail, latches
text: onto a rope attached to the side, uses the rope to block the
text: next blow. He wraps the rope around the man's wrist and
text: pulls. The man flies over the rail, into the river.
text: Bryan clambers back onto the deck, barely has time to catch
text: his breath, when a bullet smashes into the wall next to his
text: head. He turns to the two gunmen, and Ali, coming over the
text: top of the roof. With nowhere to run, he dives through the
text: window leading inside the boat.
scene_heading: INT. BOAT - NIGHT
text: Bryan lands in the interior corridor, just as two more men
text: come around the corner, with automatic weapons.
text: They fire. Bryan yanks open a door, which takes the barrage
dialog: of bullets.
text: When the smoke clears, there is no movement from behind the
text: door. The men rush the door, swing it open. There is no
dialog: one there. |
text: The men run forward, turn the corner, right into two grappling
text: hooks, that embed in their chests. Each hook held in one of
text: Bryan's hands.
text: Bryan sees a door at the far end of the corridor, grabs one
text: of the automatic weapons from the men he just dispatched,
text: heads towards the door as fast as his bum ankle will carry
dialog: him.
text: Suddenly from outside on the deck, gunfire shatters the
text: windows, rakes the corridor, tearing the wooden walls.
text: Bryan runs, returns the fire through the windows as he goes.
text: One man outside falls, another falls. Then Bryan takes a
text: bullet in the arm, loses his weapon as he hits the floor.
dialog: 100.
text: Bryan struggles up, his arm bleeding, pulls himself up on
text: the shredded wood of the wall, when Ali drops down the stairs,
text: pistol in hand.
speaker_heading: ALI
dialog: You!
text: He raises his pistol to fire. Bryan's hand, clutching the
text: wooden wall, yanks a board free, and just as Ali fires, he
text: dives forward, somersaults, and comes up right in front of
text: Ali, buries the board in his hand in Ali's forehead. The
text: exposed nails pierce Ali's brain.
text: Ali's eyes stare into Bryan's, go lifeless. Bryan pushes
text: him aside, ignores his own wound, picks up Ali's pistol and
text: limps for the door at the end of the hall.
text: Just as he approaches the door, a shot rings out from inside,
text: pierces the door. Bryan falls.
text: The door opens, and Sheikh Rahman appears, pistol in hand.
text: Behind him, Kim and the other girls are huddled on the bed.
text: Rahman stands over Bryan, regards him for a moment, then
text: turns back to the room. He hears a noise. Turns again to
text: Bryan, standing, bloodied.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
text: Party's over.
text: Rahman raises his pistol. Not as fast as Bryan. Bryan drills
text: one shot right through Rahman's forehead. Rahman falls to
text: the floor, dead.
text: Bryan steps into the room, sees Kim on the bed. She looks
text: at him with glazed, drugged eyes. He goes to her.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Kim.
text: She looks up at him, uncomprehending at first, then...
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Daddy...
text: Her eyes light with recognition.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: You came for me.
text: She starts to cry.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: You came for me.

dialog: 101.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: I told you I would.
text: He holds her close.
speaker_heading: FADE TO
scene_heading: INT. LAX - DAY
text: The doors to Customs open.
text: Kim emerges, runs into the arms of Lenore. Stuart stands

speaker_heading: STUART

speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: If it's OK with you, I think I'm

speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Honey. It's OK. You don't have to.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: I know I don't have to.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I want to.
text: A small smile breaks across Bryan's lips, nothing in
text: comparison to the one that fills his heart.
text: Kim puts her arm through his. They walk off, arm in arm.
