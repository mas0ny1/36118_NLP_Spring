scene_heading: INT. THE BARTOK PARTY- NIGHT
text: We open on a large white, pristine hall filled with people. We close in on
text: two such people, SETH BRUNDLE and VERONICA QUAIFE. They are mid-conversation:
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: What am I working on? Uh... I'm working on something that'll change the world
dialog: and human life as we know it.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Change it a lot or just a bit? You'll have to be more specific.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: What, you want me to be specific here, in this room, with, uh... half the
dialog: scientific community of North America eavesdropping?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Is there another way?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: You could come back to my lab. Listen, I'll make you cappuccino. I have a
dialog: Faema of my very own. You know what that is? It's not the Dilettante's
dialog: plastic kitchen model. It's one of those, uh uh., wh, real restaurant
text: espresso machines with a-an eagle on top and...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Somehow I get the feeling you don't get out much.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: You can tell that?
speaker_heading: VERONCA
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: I think you're making a mistake. I think you really want to talk to me.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Sorry, I have three other interviews to do before this party's over.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Yeah, but they're not working on something that'll change the world as we
dialog: know it.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: They say they are.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Yeah, but they're lying I'm not.
scene_heading: INT. VERONICA'S CAR- NIGHT
text: We close in on Veronica's car as it speeds down the street. It appears that
text: Brundle is ill.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Are you sick?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: No. Sure.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: You're not a very accomplished drunk.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: No, no, I'm always like this. It's, uh... motion sickness. When I was a kid,
dialog: I, uh... puked on my tricycle. I hate vehicles.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Should I drive more slowly?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: No, no, no. Just turn left. We're almost there.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: This is it?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
text: It's cleaner on the inside.
scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE STAIRWAY-NIGHT
text: Veronica and Brundle climb the warped wooden stairs to the fourth floor.
text: Brundle is breathing hard, very out of shape. He uses the ornate railing to
text: haul himself from step to step.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Nice railings.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE (BREATHING HARD)
dialog: Yeah. They're original.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: You doing marine experiments?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: No, why?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: That fishy smell.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE:
dialog: Oh, that. Used to be a packing house for fish. It's deserted right now except
dialog: for me. I've got the whole fourth floor. The top floor.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Want me to carry you?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Maybe next time.
scene_heading: INT. BRUNDLES LAB- NIGHT
text: Brundle and Veronica enter BRUNDLES LAB. It seems very tidy and organised as
dialog: well as being extremely Spacious.
text: Brundle sits down and begins playing on his Piano.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Listen, uh... maybe this is a bad idea.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: No, it's too late. You've already see them. Can't let you leave here alive.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: I haven't seen anything.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Those.
text: Brundle motions towards two gray pods either side of the room.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Designer phone booths. Very cute. Hey, I bet you have a really neat jukebox
dialog: in here, too, someplace, huh? Over there maybe?
text: Veronica points toward a third object, covered in tarpaulin. Brundle reveals
text: it as a third pod.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: No. This is the prototype of... those. The first one I had made. It, uh... it
dialog: works, but it's clunky. I call them telepods. They're controlled by this.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Thank God for that. So, uh, what do they do, the phone booths?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Telepods. Uh okay. I need an object. Um... say, do you have something, uh,
dialog: 
dialog: on you that's... uh, personal... that I could use? Something uniquely you?
dialog: Uh... an item of clothing or jewelry?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: What, are you kidding?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: No, I'm serious.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Okay. Here goes.
text: Veronica removes her stocking and hands it to Brundle.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: I don't wear jewelry.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: It's nice.
text: Brundle places the stocking into a pod and closes the door. He then goes back
text: to the computer and speaks into the microphone.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Uh... Brundle, Seth.
text: COMPUTER (Relaying and testing Brundle's voice pattern)
dialog: Uh, Brundle, Seth. Uh, Brundle, Seth. Uh, Brundle, Seth.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
text: Begin teleportation sequence.
text: The computer goes through it's teleportation protocol and the pod containing
text: the stocking flashes, this flash is repeated by the second pod on the
text: opposite side of the room.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Well?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Great. The world's largest microwave oven. I-I'm glade I didn't give you my
dialog: Rolex. If I had Rolex.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: No, you're missing the point. Look.
text: Veronica glaces at the Computer, which reads "Teleportation successful."
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Teleportation?
text: Brundle leads Ronnie to the Second Pod where she discovers the Stocking.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Oh... wait a minute. Is that a hologram? Where's my stocking?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: That's it. The real one. Go ahead, pick it up.
text: Veronica reaches in and retrieves the stocking.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: I don't think I get it. What happened?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: You get it, all right. You just can't handle it. Um... your stocking has just
text: been teleported... from one pod... to another. Uh, disintegrated... there and
dialog: re-integrated there. Mmm, sort of. It'll change the world as we know it,
dialog: right?
text: As she speaks, Veronica pulls a dictaphone from her pocket and begins
text: recording the conversation.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Oh, no! This is, uh... This is incredible! I mean, it's not possible, is it?
dialog: How have you managed to keep this quiet?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Please sit down.
text: The enter the kitchen area and Veronica sits down at the table. Brundle
text: begins working with his cappuchino machine.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: How could you do this alone?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Well, I don't work alone. There's a lot of stuff in there I don't even
dialog: understand. I'm really,uh... a systems management man. I farm... bits and
dialog: pieces, uh, out to guys who are much more brilliant than I am. I say...
dialog: "Build me a laser this, design me a molecular analyzer that," and they do,
dialog: and I just stick'em together. But, uh, none of them knows what the project
dialog: really is. So...
text: Brundle shows off the eagle from his Cappuchino machine.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Wow! And, uh,the money? Bartok Science Industries financed this?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Mm-hmm, But th-they leave me alone â€˜cause I'm not expensive. And, uh, they
dialog: know they'll end up owning it all, whatever it is. So...
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: You haven't told them?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: When I'm ready.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Oh... wait a second.
text: The tape on Veronica's dictaphone has run out, so she begins to change sides.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: What's that? What are you doing?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Well... you want me to get the quotes right, don't you?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Quotes? No, no. I thought this was personal. You can't write about this.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: What are you talking about? I'm a journalist.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Oh, no, no, no,..!
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: You knew that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Uh... I'm sorry. I apologize. I made a mistake. I shouldn't have shown you
dialog: this. I'm very, very sorry.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Listen... Particle magazine sent me to that party to get a story. And this is
dialog: the most exciting thing... I've ever seen.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: No, no! Absolutely not. In fact, I'm gonna have to ask you for that.
dialog: please.
dialog: tape,
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Hey, you can't do that!
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Don't you dare write a story! I'd never have told and of this stuff to a
dialog: journalist.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: But you did tell this stuff to a journalist.
text: Veronica begins to exit the lab.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Well, yeah, in a way I suppose i did, but that...
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: You sure did.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Now wait a minute, wait a minute! Wait! Come here! What about your...
dialog: stocking!
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Keep it for good luck.
text: Veronica leaves Seth standing alone in his lab.
scene_heading: INT. STATHIS'S OFFICE
text: Veronica is sat with STATHIS BORANS, her Editor. They listen to the tape.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Well... that's it. What do you think?
speaker_heading: STATHIS
dialog: It's a joke.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: STATHIS
dialog: He's conning you. Oh, it's an old nightclub routine. The two cabinets. And
dialog: you fell for it.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Wait a minute. That was no nightclub.
text: Stathis's phone rings.
speaker_heading: STATHIS
dialog: Are we having lunch?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Listen, that was no nightclub routine! I was there! I saw it!
text: Stathis talks to his assistant over the phone.
speaker_heading: STATHIS
dialog: Yeah? Sure... send him in.
dialog: You must have made an impression.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: STATHIS
dialog: Your magician has followed you here.
text: STATHIS'S ASSISTANT shows Seth in.
speaker_heading: STATHIS
dialog: I'm Stathis Borans. I'm the editor of Particle magazine.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Uh, Seth Brundle. Uh...
speaker_heading: STATHIS
dialog: Oh, I know who you are... Uh, listen, uh... why don't you two use my office?
dialog: I've gotta run. If you plan to make anything disappear, please... let me
dialog: know. I've got an assistant editor who's outlived his usefulness.
text: Stathis leaves.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: You didn't waste any time.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: I'm not getting any younger.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: He didn't seem, he wasn't impressed by your tape?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: He thinks you're a con man.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Excellent!
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Yeah? Well let's see what the people at Omni think about it.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: No, no! Uh, listen, Veronica... I've come here to say one magic word to you.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Cheeseburger.
scene_heading: INT. A FAST FOOD RESTURANT- DAY
text: In a busy fast food resturant, we close in on Brundle and Veronica, who are
text: sat eating and conversing.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: I've been working alone too long. I have a strong urge, uh,
dialog: to talk about what I'm doing. But, um, if this gets out now... Veronica,
dialog: it'll kill me. The Bartok people'll kill me... my colleagues'll kill me. It's
dialog: not ready yet.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: It seems to work okay.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: No, something important's missing.
speaker_heading: BERONICA
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Which is?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: I can only teleport inanimate objects.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Well, what happens when you try to teleport living things?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Not while we're eating.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Can't be worse than this. Listen, you're not doing a very good job of
dialog: convincing me. I think the world should know about it now and I think I
dialog: should be the one to tell it.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: You should tell it, but, uh... not yet. Look, what do you got so far?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Enough to make you nervous.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Why not get more? let me become your major project. I'm talking about a book.
dialog: Not a magazine article. Follow me and my work day by day in as much detail as
dialog: you can stand. I don't have a life, so there's nothing for you to...
dialog: interfere with. Research the background. Cover the process.
dialog: The complete record of the most... earth-shattering invention ever. The one
dialog: that ended all concepts of transport, of borders and frontiers, of time and
dialog: space. And the book'll end... with me... transporting myself fifteen feet
text: through space from one telepod to another. That's what's really missing...
dialog: Wait for me that long.
scene_heading: INT. VERONICA'S APARTMENT
text: Veronica enters her apartment and hears the distant sound of a shower from
text: her bathroom. She enters the rooom to discover Stathis taking a shower.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: What are you doing in my apartment?
speaker_heading: STATHIS
dialog: I just happened to be in the neighbourhood. Felt a bit scummy. Rough day.
text: As Veronica leaves she flushes the toilet and Stathis screams.
text: CUT TO: Stathis and Veronica in Veronica's living room. Stathis is drying his
dialog: hair while sat down.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: How did you get in?
speaker_heading: STATHIS
dialog: I have a key, remember? You gave it to me.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: I knew I should have changed the lock.
speaker_heading: STATHIS
dialog: I knew you wouldn't.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: STATHIS
dialog: Yeah. That's because... unconsciously... you still want me to come back, move
dialog: in again.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: No. That's because, very consciously, I'm lazy and disorganized.
speaker_heading: STATHIS
dialog: Your new playmate's an interesting guy.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: What playmate?
speaker_heading: STATHIS
text: The nightclub act. Brundle.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: STATHIS
dialog: Yeah. Yeah, I was wrong. He's really... quite brilliant. He was the leader
dialog: of the F-three-two team. Remember that? An inch away from the Nobel Prize for
dialog: physics. He was only twenty at the time.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Um... I don't even think I'm gonna do Brundle. I'm still considering the
dialog: Psychology Today gig.
speaker_heading: STATHIS
dialog: That's not like you.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Are you getting out or am I?
speaker_heading: STATHIS
dialog: I'll go. I have to put this issue to bed. You want me to come back later and
dialog: tuck you... in?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: No. Key.
speaker_heading: STATHIS
dialog: I'll keep it... for old time's sake.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: You're a petty schmuck!
scene_heading: INT. BRUNDLES LAB
text: Brundle is sat typing at his Computer as Veronica films him . We see a baboon
text: sat in Telepod 1. Brundle finishes typing.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
text: Initiate in five seconds.
text: After 5 seconds, The baboon teleports into Pod 2. Veronica is still filming
text: as Brundle trys to peer through the smoke into the recieving pod. Suddenly a
text: blood soaked paw smashes against the window. Seth reluctantly opens the pod
text: to discover the mangled, spasming remains of the dying baboon.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Seth stands behind Pod 2 as Veronica focuses the Camera on him.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: We've got to do this Seth. Talk to the tape, get in the habit. the world will
dialog: want to know what you're thinking.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Fuck is what I'm thinking!
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Good. The World will want to know that. What else? Why didn't it work?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: I think it turned the baboon inside out.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
text: It can't deal with he flesh. It only seems to work with inanimate objects
dialog: nothing that's living. It must be my fault.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Computers are dumb, they only know what you tell them. I must not know enough
dialog: about the flesh myself, I'm going to have to learn. I don't want to talk
dialog: anymore.
text: Seth turns and walks away
scene_heading: INT. BRUNDLES BEDROOM- NIGHT
text: Brundle is laid out on his bed and Veronica is sat gently swaying on a
text: rocking chair in the corner of the room.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Do you ever change your clothes?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Your clothes, you're always wearing the same clothes.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: No, these are clean. I change my clothes every day.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Five sets of exactly the same clothes?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Ordered from Einstein. This ways I don't have to spend any thought on what
dialog: I'm going to wear, I just grab the next set on the rack.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: I bought some steaks. Can I make you one?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: We could go out?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: "Cheeseburger"?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: No. We don't have to go there.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: You're very cute, you know that?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Am I?
text: Veronica and Brundle begin to Kiss.
scene_heading: INT. BRUNDLES BEDROOM- NIGHT
text: We pan in on Brundle and Veronica making love on Brundle's bed. Brundle lays
text: back on the bed and jumps up in pain suddenly.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Ohh Ahh, My back.
text: Veronica examines Seth's back to discover a small Computer chip stuck to it.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Oh god, Something's stuck to your back.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Well pull it off.
text: Veronica slowly pulls out the chip and Shows it to Brundle.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: I wondered what happened to that!
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Do you have any disinfectant?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: No, it's okay.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: I'm going to kiss it for you!
text: Veronica kisses Brundle's back and playfully bites his arm.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: I'm sorry. I just want to eat you up. You know, that's why old ladies pinch
dialog: babies cheeks. It's the flesh. it just makes you crazy.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Ronnie, Ronnie. You want to try an experiment?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Sure.
scene_heading: INT. BRUNDLES KITCHEN- NIGHT
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Eat this. I need an objective opinion. Yes?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Well, it could use some Finesse, but it tastes like a steak.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Okay, Now try this, teleported half.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Are you serious? A monkey just came apart in there!
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Baboon. Eat.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Ohh, it tastes funny.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Funny how?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: It tastes, synthetic. So what have we proved?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
text: The computer is giving us it's interpretation of a steak. It's translating it
dialog: for us, it's re-thinking it rather than reproducing it, and something's
text: getting lost in the translation.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Me. I'm lost.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: The flesh. It should make the computer crazy, like those old ladies pinching
dialog: babies. But it doesn't, not yet. I haven't tought it to be made crazy by the
dialog: flesh, the poultry, the steak. So I'm going to start teaching it now!
scene_heading: INT. A CLOTHES SHOP- DAY

dialog: Why didn't I believe you? I wonder.
text: Stathis takes the jacket.
speaker_heading: STATHIS
dialog: Oh yeah. I think he'd look great in this, Don't you? I mean, for your "Time
dialog: Magazine" cover, you've got to look good right?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Don't you get it? I am finally onto something that's big. Huge.
speaker_heading: STATHIS
dialog: Oh yeah? What? His Cock?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Crude Stathis. Very crude.
speaker_heading: STATHIS
dialog: Too perfect to believe! You're a goddess! Thank you for making my most
dialog: paranoid fantasies come true!
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: I don't have to report to you, you creep!
speaker_heading: STATHIS
dialog: Ronnie! You've got to talk to me!
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: I don't have to do anything! We're finished, remember? I'll spend the night

speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Could be weeks.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Yeah. Why?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Well I was thinking, that we could take a Holiday.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: We could?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Yeah. Like an old married couple. Old man's got a couple of weeks off so they
dialog: go to Florida. Someplace warm. Just the two of us?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Just you and me?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Yeah, why? Is there someone else you were thinking of Bringing along?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: No, No. Is this a romance we're having, is that what it is?

dialog: 
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Oh no.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Oh nothing, it's just personal bullshit.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: I thought old married couples shared all their personal bullshit, that's how
dialog: they stayed old and married.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Listen Seth, Don't rush it.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: What are you talking about "Rush it"?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Look, I have to go out for a few hours.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Now? No, Ronnie! Spicy Egg plant, the champagne!
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Just for a few hours. I still have the residue of another life, you know, I
dialog: have to scrape it off my shoe and get rid of it once and for all.

speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Hi.
scene_heading: INT. STATHIS'S OFFICE- NIGHT
text: Veronica enters Stathis's office, and throws the folder onto his desk
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: What's this supposed to mean?
speaker_heading: STATHIS
dialog: It means that I'm your editor and I'm shaping your material into a story.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: You're the one who told me there was no story. You said Brundle was a Con
dialog: man.
speaker_heading: STATHIS
dialog: I've decided to trust your Journalistic instincts.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Thanks very much. But this is not your story. It's mine.
speaker_heading: STATHIS
dialog: Says who? I sent you to the Bartok party to see what you could find. Your
dialog: discovery is my discovery. I have a LOT of background on Brundle. He's been
dialog: working on this thing for 6 years. There's material out there if you dig
dialog: deep. I dug.

speaker_heading: VERONICA

speaker_heading: STATHIS
dialog: I don't want you to disappear from my life.
speaker_heading: VERONICA

speaker_heading: STATHIS

speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
text: Residue means her old Boyfriend. Stathis Borans is her old boyfriend. "from

text: She's working for her old boyfriend. Now she runs out late to see him. What
dialog: is this, "The Ronnie Game"? I'm catching on, I'm catching on. I didn't mean
dialog: to kill your brother. But he didn't die in vain, if that's of any comfort.
dialog: And as the general said; "There's nothing I'd ask you to that I wouldn't do
dialog: myself boys." Hey you're alright. Looking at you I can tell you're okay. What
dialog: are we waiting for? Let's do it.
text: Brundle slams down his glass and heads for the computer.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

text: door shoots and locks.
text: The baboon jumps up and over to the Pod, it peers through at Brundle,
text: who smiles and reaches out. The fly, meanwhile rests in the viewing port,
text: safe out of reach.
text: The telepod boots up and Brundle prepares himself. Suddenly, The Fly
text: moves out of the port and into the pod. Brundle is teleported.
text: The baboon shifts it's gaze o Pod 2, from where Brundle emerges.
text: Into Brundle's arms jumps the baboon.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: How're you doing? Now you tell me. Am I different somehow? Is it live or is

scene_heading: INT. BRUNDLES BEDROOM- NIGHT
text: Veronica enters the Bedroom and sits next to Brundle, who wakes.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: I missed you last night.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: It's still night. I came back. You had to celebrate without me. I'm sorry
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: I went through last night.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: You went through? Without testing the baboon?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: I-I-I was... drunk. I was a bit upset.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: You could have killed yourself!
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Are you sleeping with Stathis Borans?
text: Brundle wraps the sheet around himself and stands up.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: I-I-I don't know. I-I just, um, get that feeling.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: That's why you were upset?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: I got jealous.
text: Brundle takes a seat in the kitchen and Veronica sits on his lap.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Oh, God. Seth... you don't have to be jealous. He's an old boy... friend. He
dialog: was teaching at college. I was a science major. He got me started in
dialog: journalism.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Is he still in love with you?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: How could he not be? Hey... wh-what about our deal? You went through
dialog: and I wasn't there.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Don't worry. I taped it for you.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: You did?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Yeah.
text: They begin kissing and Veronica slides her hand down his back, she doesn't
text: notice the small hairs that are beginning to protude from the cut in his
dialog: back.
scene_heading: INT. BRUNDLES LAB- DAY
text: Brundle and Veronica are laid next to each other in Bed. They Both appear to
text: be asleep. Suddenly Brundles hand reaches out and grabs the air. Brundle
text: opens his eyes and his fist to see that he caught a house fly. He looks
text: around, then gets out of bed.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Time passes and Veronica wakes up. She slips on a shirt and goes into the
text: lab. She sits down and watches as Brundle excersises on a chait. He uses his
text: hands on the arms to lift himself up and down. He then goes over to a steel
text: bar which stretches across part of the lab and swings back and forth on it.
text: He appears to be very energetic and experienced at what he is doing. He lifts
text: himself up, and then swings back down onto the floor. He turns around to See
text: Veronica, who stand up and rests her hand on Brundle's chest.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: T.V. IMAGES From time to time we cut to the live (film) version of these same
text: images. When we are live, we also see reactions from Veronica. Brundle is
text: being interviewed in CLOSE-UP; VERONICA SPEAKS OFF-CAMERA.
speaker_heading: VERONICA (OC:
text: We've just seen the first teleportation of a human being. Dr. Seth Brundle,
dialog: how did it feel going through? What did it feel like?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE (ON TAPE:
text: It feels like a stutter.
speaker_heading: VERONICA:
dialog: A what?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE:
text: A stutter. A hiccup. A slight dislocation of my physical life. Not
text: unpleasant. Just a little interuption of rhythym. For a second I thought it
dialog: didn't work. I thought I was in the same telepod I started out in.
speaker_heading: VERONICA (OC):
dialog: And did you feel at all different?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE (ON TAPE):
dialog: A little...unbalanced. That's all.
speaker_heading: VERONICA (OC):
dialog: And now?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE (ON TAPE)
text: I should feel exactly the same as before, but I don't. I'm not complaining.
text: I feel very co-ordinated. And very energized. I feel as though I work better,
text: physically. Everthing seems to just - work together better than it ever did
dialog: before.
speaker_heading: VERONICA (OC):
dialog: Why should that be?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE (ON TAPE):
dialog: It's possible that the teleporter has somehow...improved me.
speaker_heading: VERONICA (OC):
dialog: But that's fantastic! How is it possible?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE (ON TAPE):
dialog: In reassembling me it might have - this is just a guess - but it might have
dialog: just - seen where things could be improved - theoretically, and it did it. I
dialog: told it to be creative, and I guess it has been.
speaker_heading: VERONICA (OC):
dialog: Could this ever be dangerous?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE:
dialog: Well, it's certainly unexpected. The monkeys haven't shown any change from
dialog: their norm. We'll see when they come back from testing.
speaker_heading: VERONICA:
dialog: You still haven't answered me. Could this ever be dangerous?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE (ON TAPE):
dialog: It feels too perfect to be dangerous.
speaker_heading: VERONICA:
dialog: You like the way it feels?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE (ON TAPE):
dialog: Yes, I do. (BIG SMILE) Want to try it?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

scene_heading: EXT. THE STREETS- DAY
text: Brundle and Veronica walk down the busy street. They stop at a small
text: jewellers in a market and Brundle picks out a neckelace for Veronica.
scene_heading: INT. COFFEE SHOP- DAY
text: Veronica and Brundle are sat opposite each other in a small coffee shop.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: So, I asked the computer if it improved me and it said it didn't know what I
dialog: was talking about. And that's made me think very carefully about what I've
dialog: been feeling, and why. And I'm beginning to think that the sheer process of
text: being taken apart atom by atom and put back together again, why it's like
text: coffee being put through a filter. It's somehow a purifying process. It's
dialog: purified me, it's cleansed me. And I tell you, I think it's going to allow me
dialog: to realise the personal potential, I've been neglecting all these years. That
dialog: I've been obsessively pursuing goal after goal.
text: Veronica notices that Brundle has filled his cup almost to the top with
dialog: sugar.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Do you normally take coffee with your sugar?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: What? Heh. You know I just don't think I've ever given me, a chance to be me.
dialog: But, of course Interestingly, and the exact same moment that I achieved what
dialog: will probably prove to be my life's work, that's the moment when I started
dialog: being the real me finally. Listen, not to wax messianic. It may be true that
text: the synchronicity of those two events might blur the resultant individual
dialog: effect of either individual. But it is nevertheless it is also certainly
dialog: true, I will say now however subjectively; that Human teleportation,
text: molecular decimation, breakdown and reformation is inherently purging. It
dialog: makes a man a King. From the moment I walked out of the pod I felt like a
dialog: million bucks. You know , I think I am gonna have a cemoli after all. Waiter!
dialog: I mean, What an accomplishment.
dialog: But, what have I really done? All I've done is say to the world, "Lets go,
dialog: Move. Catch me if you can". Waiter. Jesus Christ!
scene_heading: INT. BRUNDLES LAB- DAY
text: We pan through Brundle's lab to discover Brundle and Veronica making love on
text: the couch. Veronica is half wearing a dressing gown.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: How? How can you keep going? You can't have... have any fluid left in your
dialog: body. We've been doing this for hours.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Uhhhh, I'm not ready to quit yet. Hey, come on.
speaker_heading: VERONICA]
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Come on.
text: Veronica moves her hand down Brundle's back and finds think hairs protruding
text: from the cuts in his back, left by the computer chip.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: What's this?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: It's an attempt to distract me, that's what it is.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: No, really, what is it? It's like, hairs or something.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: I don't know. It's... It happens when you get older. Weird hair
dialog: configurations. I don't know.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: They are really coarse.
speaker_heading: BRUNCLE
dialog: Well, I've never really been hairy enough. You know what I mean? Always
dialog: too... boyish. I'm looking forward to a hairy body.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: No, I...
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: It's one of the compensations of old age. Come here. Where are you going?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: No, let me go.
text: Veronica stands up and Wraps the dressing gown around her. She stands up and
text: goes into the kitchen. Brundle puts underwear on and gets some ice cream from
text: the freezer. He sits down and begins eating. Veronica, using a pair of
text: scissors, tried to cut the hairs from his back.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Okay. Hey, hey, hey! Not my new hairs. What are you doing?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Relax, Brundle. I don't really think you want a body covered with these. God!
dialog: They're... really tough.
text: Suddenly, Brundle drops the spoon and stands up. As he talks he walks with
text: Ronnie towards the telepods.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Listen... I want you to go through. I want to teleport you as soon as
dialog: possible. Right now! You'll feel incredible. Ronnie... I hardly need to sleep
dialog: anymore and I feel wonderful. It's like a drug, but a perfectly pure and
dialog: benign drug. The power I feel surging inside me! And I won't be able to wear
dialog: you out. We'll be the perfect couple. The dynamic duo! Come on, right now!
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: No! Hey, wait! Don't give me that born-again teleportation rap. I-I told you
dialog: I'm scared to do it! What more do I have to say? I'm... not gonna do it!!!
text: Veronica pulls herself away.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: You're a fucking drag, you know that?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Something went wrong, Seth. When you went through, something went wrong.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: No? Not you? If you're too chickenshit to be a member of the dynamic duo
dialog: club, okay then, great. I'll find somebody else. Somebody who can keep up
dialog: with me.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Seth, you have to listen to me.
text: Brundle gets dressed and heads for the door.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: You're afraid to dive into the plasma pool, aren't you? You're afraid to be
dialog: destroyed and recreated, aren't you? I'll bet you think that you woke me up
dialog: about the flesh, don't you? But you only know society's straight line about
dialog: the flesh. You can't penetrate beyond society's sick gray fear of the flesh!
dialog: Drink deep or taste not the plasma spring! You see what I'm saying? I'm not
dialog: just talking about sex and penetration, I'm talking about penetration beyond
text: the veil of the flesh! A deep, penetrating dive into the plasma pool!
text: Brundle leaves Veronica standing shocked in the lab. As he walks down the
text: corridor he jumps up and hits a light shade.
scene_heading: EXT. THE STREETS- NIGHT
text: Brundle walks down the street, from his pocket he pulls a chocolate bar
text: which he begins to eat.
scene_heading: INT. A BAR- NIGHT
text: Brundle enters the Bar. Sitting at the Bar itself is TAWNY, meanwhile MARKY
text: and MAN IN BAR are armwrestling.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: I'll have a scotch.
dialog: Who's winning?
speaker_heading: TAWNY
dialog: I don't know. I hope it's Marky.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: How come?
speaker_heading: TAWNY
dialog: Because; I like Marky tonight.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Well, I like you tonight. Maybe I should get involved in this too.
speaker_heading: MARKY
dialog: Hey pal. You're disturbing us.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: I got a hundred bucks says I can beat either one of you.
speaker_heading: MARKY
dialog: Take a hike, asshole!
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Here. Here's my hundred. And, I get to take the lady home for the night if I
dialog: win.
speaker_heading: TAWNY
dialog: Says Who? do I look like a hooker to you?
speaker_heading: MARKY
dialog: Hey Tawny, it's an easy hundred. Come on pal, let's get it over with.
speaker_heading: MAN IN BAR
dialog: You better watch out. He eats chocolate bars.
speaker_heading: MARKY
dialog: Yeah, So I noticed.
text: Brundle and Marky start the armwrestle. Marky begins to look worried and a
text: white pus seems to be coming from Brundle's hand. With a flip of his hand,
text: Brundle snaps the bone in Marky's wrist. Brundle stands up, grabs Tawny, and
dialog: leaves.
scene_heading: EXT. THE STREETS- NIGHT
text: Brundle and Tawny walk down the street chatting.
speaker_heading: TAWNY
dialog: Are you a body builder or something?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Yeah I build bodies. I take them apart and then I put them back together
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: TAWNY
dialog: Why, you certainly took Marky apart.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Let's go back to my place.
speaker_heading: TAWNY
dialog: Your place? Yeah Well, I live with my Mother anyway. But can we maybe go to a
dialog: few more bars first? It's a little too early to quit.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Sure a few more bars.
scene_heading: EXT. BRUNDLES LAB- EARLY MORNING
text: A taxi pulls up outside Brundle's lab. From it emerge Brundle and Tawny.
scene_heading: INT. BRUNDLES LAB- EARLY MORNING
text: Brundle and Tawny are walking up the stairs to Brundle's apartment. Tawny

speaker_heading: TAWNY

speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Oh there's an elevator.
text: Brundle picks Tawny up.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: There. Don't you feel elevated?
text: Brundle runs at a fast, continuous pace up the stairs with Tawny in his arms.
speaker_heading: TAWNY
dialog: Woah!
scene_heading: INT. BRUNDLES LAB- EARLY MORNING
text: While Tawny Watches, Brundle teleports himself. He emerges naked and stands
dialog: before Tawny.
speaker_heading: TAWNY
dialog: Wow. Are you some sort of a magician?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Yes.
text: Brundle lays on Tawny and begins to kiss her.
scene_heading: INT. BRUNDLES LAB- DAY
text: Tawny and Seth are Sat on Seth's bed. Tawny appears to be rather laid back
text: but Brundle is the opposite; he is hunched over and has a tight look on hid
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: TAWNY
dialog: So, are we going to breakfast or not?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: It's your turn.
speaker_heading: TAWNY
dialog: To do what?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: I want you to go through.
speaker_heading: TAWNY
dialog: No. I don't want to try that.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Why not? It'll make you feel sexy
speaker_heading: TAWNY
dialog: I already feel sexy. How about... A nice alcohol rub?
text: Tawny Pours some alchohol onto her hand but Brundle knocks the bottle onto
dialog: the floor.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Don't do that, it hurts!
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Sorry Hon'. I didn't know you had the skin of a Princess. You're real
dialog: sensitive huh?
text: Tawny tries to massage Brundle's back, but he pulls her away and tries to
text: drag her into the lab area. He doesn't realise that Veronica has entered the
dialog: lab.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Okay, okay! Now you're going to like it!
speaker_heading: TAWNY
dialog: I don't want to! I'm afraid!
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Don't be afraid!
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: No. Be afraid. Be very afraid.
speaker_heading: TAWNY
dialog: Who's this?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Oh, I forgot to tell you, I live with my mother, too. Mum, meet Tawny.
speaker_heading: TAWNY
dialog: I gotta go. Thanks for a wonderful time.
text: Tawny picks up her clothes and leaves.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Why'd you scare her off? Jealous?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: You're changing. Seth. Everything about you is changing. You look bad. You
dialog: smell bad.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: I've never been much of a bather.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Those... weird hairs that were growing out of your back, I took them to a
dialog: lab. I had them analyzed.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: The hairs? Oh... yeah, that's a strange thing to do.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
text: Not as strange as the results. The guy at the lab had trouble identifying
dialog: them. He finally came to the conclusion... that they were definitely not
dialog: human.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Oh! Very good.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Not human... Seth. In fact... very likely insect hairs.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: That's silly. That's ridiculous.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Look. Now there's more. Uh, look at your face! Something happened when you
dialog: went through, Seth. You've got to get some help. I think you must be sick.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: You're jealous!!! I've become free, I've been released, and you can't stand
dialog: it! You'll so anything to bring me down. Look at me. Does this look sick?
dialog: Does this look like a sick man to you?
text: Brundle starts punching a support beam attatched to the corner of the wall.
text: As he punches it parts of it exlode out, and buckle.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: No! Stop it!
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Do you know any sick men who can do that? Come here!
text: Brundle pulls Veronica and throws her out of the door.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: No... Seth!
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: The deal is off! I don't need you anymore.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: No, wait! Seth, please, wait! Seth!
text: Brundle pulls the door shut and locks it.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Don't come back!
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Oh, God! Oh, my God.
text: We stay with Veronica as she slowly walks down the corridor.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Brundle enters his Bathroom and seems worried when he examines himself in the
text: mirror. He tries to shave with an electric razor, which hurts so Brundle
text: throws it into the bath and destroys it.
text: He then looks back in the mirror and bites his nail, which comes off
text: in his teeth, He squeezes the end which projects a white liquid onto the
text: mirror. He then pulls another nail off before sitting on the rim of his bath
dialog: tub.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Am I dying? Is this how it starts, am I dying?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Brundle is sat at his computer with a pair of gloves on.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Give me a disc. I need the first teleportation: S. Brundle
text: The computers shows the log of Seth's first teleportation, which also shows a
text: second object in the telepod. When Brundle asks what the secondary object is,
dialog: the computers replies "Secondary element is..... Not-Brundle".
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Run Sequence.
text: The computer runs through several scans of the "Secondary element", and it
text: becomes clear that it is a fly. Brundle asks the computer, through typing,
text: what happened to the fly. The Computer soon responds with, "Fusion". Brundle
text: finally asks if he absorbed and assimilated the fly. The Computer tells him;
text: "Negative, Fusion of Brundle and Fly at molecular Genetic level."
scene_heading: INT. RONNIES APARTMENT- NIGHT
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: (Mumbles)
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Seth! Seth, I've been trying to reach you. Where are you?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: For the last four weeks I've been afraid to see you. Now, I'm afraid not to.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Where are you? Are you at home?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Veronica. You don't know how right you were. I've gotten, much much worse.
dialog: Please come see me. Please come now.
scene_heading: INT. BRUNDLES LAB- NIGHT
text: Veronica enters the Lab, which appears to be empty.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Seth? I'm here.

dialog: exposed.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Stop!
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Seth!
text: Seth Brundle, now walking on Canes, shows himself after a month of self
dialog: induced insolation. He is much worse than when we last met him and alot of
text: his hair has fallen out. His skin has a gray colour to it and is covered in
text: small lumps and spots. He wears gloves.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: You were right. I'm diseased and, uh... it might be contagious somehow. I
dialog: wouldn't want to infect you. And it's been accelerating. It's unrelenting.
dialog: Every time I look in the mirror, there's someone different, someone hideous,
dialog: repulsive.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: I know an old lady who swallowed a fly perhaps she'll die.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Seth... please.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: I was not pure. The teleporter insists on inner purity. I was not pure.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: I don't know what you mean.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: A fly got into the transmitter pod with me that first time when i was alone.
dialog: Uh, the computer got confused; there weren't supposed to be two separate
dialog: genetic patterns and it decided to splice us together. It mated us, me and
text: the fly. We hadn't even been properly introduced. My teleporter turned her
dialog: into a gene splicer. And a very good one. Now I'm not Seth Brundle anymore.
dialog: I'm the offspring of, um, Brundle and housefly.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Oh, God!
text: Veronica moves closer to Brundle, who jumps up from his seat.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Oh, God!
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Please.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Seth!
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: You look so pretty.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: What will happen?
text: Brundle sits back down in another chair.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Oh, I think it's showing itself as a bizarre form of cancer.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: And general cellular chaos and revolution. I'm, just gonna have to
text: disintegrate. In a novel way, no doubt. And then I'll die. And then it will
dialog: be all over.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: No, no, no. I don't accept that. There must be something we can do, you know,
dialog: somebody we can go to, tests that can be done.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: No! Um, I won't be just another tumorous bore talking endlessly about his
text: hair falling out and his lost lymph nodes.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Well, then what do you want me to do? Why did you call me?
text: Brundle picks up a donut and vomits a white liquid over it. Veronica utters a
text: small scream and puts her hand over her mouth.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Oh, that's disgusting.
text: He puts the donut down and touches his ear, which falls onto the floor.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: My ear, No! I'm scared.
text: Seth and Veronics hug.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Help me. Please, please help me.

speaker_heading: STATHIS
dialog: Don't go back to him.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: That's it? that's your advice?
speaker_heading: STATHIS
dialog: He's right, don't you see. It could be contagious. It could turn into an
dialog: epidemic.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: I have to go back to him.
speaker_heading: STATHIS
dialog: I don't believe this.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: If you could see how scared, and angry and desperate he is...
speaker_heading: STATHIS
dialog: I'm sure typhoid Mary was a very nice person too, when you saw her socially.
dialog: Listen, I do not want.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: I don't care what you want!
speaker_heading: STATHIS
dialog: Alright! Fine! Do I have permission to clean your body when this is all over?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Oh god...
speaker_heading: STATHIS
dialog: Look, how about this - You say "If only I saw him". Show me. Tape him, show
dialog: me. Let me think about it. I'll come up with something.
scene_heading: INT. BRUNDLES LAB- DAY
text: We see from the roof as Veronica enters the Lab.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Seth? Seth?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: No, no. Up here.
text: Veronics is shocked to look up and see Brundle walking on all fours on the
text: ceiling. He moves very well and seems quite used to it.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: I've gotten pretty good at it haven't I? You know it's almost second nature.
dialog: Stopped biting my nails. Oh look at this, what's this? I don't know. I seem
dialog: to be stricken by a disease with a purpose wouldn't you say? Maybe not such a
dialog: bad purpose after all.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: I can't stay.
text: Brundle is now horizontal and stuck to the door. He jumps down and walks
text: close to Veronica.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Why not? Why can't you?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: I can't take it. It's too much.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: What's there to take? The disease has just revealed it's purpose. We don't
dialog: have to worry about contagion anymore, I know what the disease wants.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: What does the disease want?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: It wants to turn me into something else. That's not too terrible is it? Most
dialog: people would give anything to be turned into something else.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Turned into what?
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: What do you think a fly? Am I becoming a hundred and eighty five pound fly?
dialog: No, I'm becoming something that's never existed before. I'm becoming
dialog: "Brundlefly", don't you think that's worth a Nobel prize or two? Here.
text: Brundle brings the camera near to the table in front of Veronica.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: I'm going to give a demonstration that I think you'll want to record for
dialog: prosperity.
text: Brundle throws alot of the Rubbish off of the table and sits in front of the
dialog: Camera.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: I think we must chronicle the life and times of Brundlefly, don't you? At
dialog: the very least it should make a fabulous, Children's book. You seem tired.
dialog: You got me there? How does Brundlefly eat? Well, he found out the very hard
text: and painful way that he eats very much the same way a fly eats. His teeth are
text: now useless because although he can chew up solid food, he can't digest it,
text: solid food hurts. So like a fly, Brundlefly breaks down the solid with a
text: corrosive enzyme, pleasurably called "Vomit drop". He regurgitates on his
dialog: food, it liquifies, and then he sucks it back up. You ready for a
dialog: demonstration kids? Here goes...
scene_heading: INT. VERONICAS APARTMENT- NIGHT
text: We see Brundle on the screen in Veronica's apartment as Stathis watches it.
speaker_heading: STATHIS
dialog: My God. My God.
text: Suddenly Veronica enters and goes straight down the corridor in tears.
speaker_heading: STATHIS
dialog: Hey, Ronnie. Ronnie?
text: Stathis follows and Discovers her sat down crying. He kneels down next to
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: STATHIS
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: I'm pregnant.
speaker_heading: STATHIS
dialog: No!? Oh no...
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: I'm pregnant with Seth's baby.
speaker_heading: STATHIS
dialog: What do you want to do?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: I don't know. I just, I don't know...
scene_heading: INT. BRUNDLES LAB- NIGHT
text: We are close on Brundle's fingers as they dance over the keys of the computer
text: keyboard. Brundle has cut the fingers off a pair of yellow rubber kitchen
text: gloves and jammed them down over his fingertips, so that his fingers won't
dialog: stick to the keyboard.
speaker_heading: CU MONITOR which reads:
scene_heading: GENE-SPLICING PROGRAM NOW IN PLACE
scene_heading: TELEPOD 1: TRANSMITTER POD SUBJECT A
scene_heading: TELEPOD 2: TRANSMITTER POD SUBJECT B
scene_heading: TELEPOD 3: RECEIVER POD FOR GENETICALLY FUSED A-B COMBINATION SUBJECT
text: We pull back to see that in front of Brundle and his keyboard stand not two,
text: but THREE telepods, the third one of a somewhat older and more handbuilt
text: vintage than the other two- the original PROTOTYPE TELEPOD which has been
text: sitting in a corner of the lab under a tarpaulin and was noticed by Veronica
text: on her first visit to the lab. In TELEPOD A sits a monkey, in TELEPOD B an
text: alley cat. TELEPOD C, the old prototype receiver, is empty. Brundle operates
text: the machine. The monitor says, READY FOR FUSION Brundle presses the ACCEPT
text: button. The telepods go through their normal disintegration routine as the
text: animals' outlines appear on the monitor in split screen fashion. But now, as
text: the reintegration process begins, a stream of data concerning this new
text: experiment, the fusion of monkey and cat, floods the screen. The basic
dialog: message that gets across to us through all the hi-tech compu-talk is:
scene_heading: PERCENTAGE OF MONKEY-63 PERCENTAGE OF CAT-37
text: These numbers fluctuate as the machine tries to strike a molecular
text: balance between the two creatures. Finally, an outline of the fused creature
text: begind to form on the screen. brundle looks up to see the actual creature
text: forming, and it is indeed grotesque: two heads- one monkey, one cat- at odd
text: angles to each other, six legs which are not quite symmetrically placed on
text: the monkey torso, cat tail. As the creature solidifies and the light goes
text: off, it sits there in the telepod for a moment, half-reclining as though
text: crippled. Brundle gets up, goes to the third telepod, and with great
text: apprehension, opens the door. The thing just sits there, slumped for a beat,
text: then SUDDENLY LEAPS UP AT HIM, its two heads SHREIKING! It jumps on his arm,
text: clinging, snarling, then drops to the floor. The two heads begin to bite each
text: other, blood begins to flow- the thing now running around in mad floppy
text: circles, smearing blood everywhere. Brundle is horrified. He grabs a metal
text: rod leaning in a corner and begins to smash at the deformed thing. He keeps
text: smashing at it until it stops its hideous screeching and lies dead, mangled
text: on the floor. Brundle wraps it up in a towel and throws it into the
text: refrigerator. He draws the old torn sheet over the third telepod so he
text: doesn't have to look at it again. Back at the monitor, the screen is flashing
scene_heading: the words: FUSION SUCCESSFUL RECEIVER TELEPOD 3
text: Brundle puts his face in his hands for a few moments, then pulls himself
text: together. He pulls the rubber fingertips off his fingers and throws them to
text: the ground. Brundle has now developed some insect-like tics and mannerisms,
text: his head twitching with nervous little jerks and his long fingers in constant
text: motion. We see clearly now that all of Brundle's fly characteristics have
text: been accentuated even further. The metallic-green hair which completely
text: covers his face is much thicker than before, and the hernia-like bulge in his
text: side is more protuberant now, stretched to the bursting point and obviously
text: causing Brundle some pain. Brundle looks at the skylight. The sky is clear,
text: the moon is a scimitar. On an impulse, he jumps up on the wall, sticking
text: there for a beat. Then, with incredible agility, he ascends the wall, crosses
text: the celing toward the skylight. ON THE CEILING Brundle glides on all fours,
text: upside down, towards the skylight. Once there, he crawls into it and opens it
dialog: up.
scene_heading: EXT. LAB ROOFTOP-NIGHT
text: Brundle clambers out of the skylight onto the roof. The night is gorgeous,
text: clean and bright, the sky packed with stars. Brundle breathes deeply. He is
text: still alive, isn't he? He can still respond to the beauty of the night, can't
dialog: he?
scene_heading: EXT. MONTAGE- BRUNDLE'S TRAVELS- NIGHT
text: We follow Brundle on his solitary sojourn in a MONTAGE SEQUENCE. He climbs
text: walls with amazing ability, leaps from rooftop to rooftop, hangs upside down
text: from ledges and lampposts, eavesdropping on the city life around and below
text: him, the inhabitants unaware of the unusual and shadowy observer in their
text: midst. He scurries along the girder of a bridge, gazing down on the traffic
text: and the river below him. These moments should be poetic, even beautiful,
text: joyous. The moon is luminous, the dark night exquisite. Resigned to his fate
text: and momentarily forgetful of his future, Brundle seems to be reveling in his
text: unique powers. A brief euphoric fling.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: Brundle leaps across a narrow alleyway to the wall of the building opposite
text: him. He smiles with smug satisfaction at his feat, then suddenly winces,
text: grabbing his side with one of his hands. WE HEAR A CRACKING, SPLITTING SOUND.
text: Brundle muffles a startled cry, and losing his balance, slides several feet
text: down the wall before regaining hold. He looks down at the huge bulge in his
text: side and sees that it is starting to split open!
text: Brundle is horrified and in pain. He starts to quickly move down the side of
text: the building but the pain impedes his progress. He manages to get down at
text: least another floor before he's hit with another sharp pain. He doubles up
text: and his tenuous grip on the wall causes him to slide another several feet
text: downward before he regains his grip. The side is gaping wide now and
text: SOMETHING is starting to protrude. Brundle is in shock. another ripple of
text: pain causes him to release his grasp entirely and he falls to the ground in a
text: dirty narrow alley, where he writhes in pain, as a STRANGE, HAIRY STICKLIKE
text: APPENDAGE--ACTUALLY THE BEGINNINGS OF A FLYLIKE LEG-- begins to unfold
text: awkwardly out of his side.Despite his excrutiating pain, Brundle watches with
text: fixated, wide-eyed terror at his latest transformation! The insect leg now
text: begins to probe around, function like a real leg, almost with a mind of its
text: own. Grotesque as Brundle has become, he can't accept the next step towards
text: real insectness which this new leg represents. He screams at the leg.
scene_heading: BRUNDLE (SCREAMING AT THE LEG)
dialog: No! No, I won't! I won't, I won't, I won't..!
text: Brundle grabs at the leg, holds it, subdues it and then begins to gnaw at it
text: with his teeth at its base, twisting himself into an agonized ball in order
text: to do it. The leg begins to lever at his back, small hooklike protrusions all
text: along its underside catching in the flesh of Brundle's back, tearing it in
text: protest against Brundle's attempt at amputation. Finally, Brundle has severed
text: the leg with his teeth. The leg drops off leaving a strand or two of stringy
text: gristle hanging from the knobby stump in Brundle's side. The leg twitches on
text: the ground, tries to extend itself. Brundle looks at the leg in shock, his
text: eyes crazed, like an animal who has been caught in a leg-trap and has had to
text: gnaw off the leg to be free. Brundle tries to steady himself, then staggers
text: away down the alley. As he goes, he wipes the insect blood from his lips with
text: his two forearms In exactly the same way that flies clean their faces.

speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: There's more?
speaker_heading: GYNACOLOGIST
dialog: Yeah. I mean a lot more. Okay. You're going to have to help us. Come on, you

speaker_heading: GYNACOLOGIST

scene_heading: INT. BRUNDLES LAB- NIGHT
text: Brundle is stood at his computer typing. After reading the displayed text
text: regarding a cure by gene-Splicing Brundle asks for information:
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: I want a disk. Give me preliminary integration.
text: The computers scrolls "Voice Not recognised down the side of the screen"
text: Brundle stops it and bites on his pencil, which causes his front teeth to
text: fall out onto the keyboard. He counts his teeth with his tounge and sighs.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Brundle stumbles into the Bathroom and opens his medicine cabinet, which is
text: full of body parts which have fallen off. Brundle talks to his teeth before
text: confinding them to the cabinet.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: You're relics. Yes you are. Vestigial, archeological, redundant. Artifacts of
text: a bygone era. Of historical interest only.
text: As Brundle closes the cabinet, he catches sight of Veronica, who has entered
text: the Lab and is standing opposite Brundle, with Brundle's bedroom in between
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: You've missed some good moments. Is that why you're here? To catch up?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: I wanted
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
text: My teeth have begun to fall out. The... medicine cabinet's now the Brundle

speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Then... what do you want?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
text: I came to tell you... uh... I, uh, I just... I wanted to see you... before...
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: You have to leave now... and never come back here. Have you ever heard of...
dialog: insect politics? Neither have I. Insects... don't have politics. They're very
dialog: brutal. No compassion, no compromise. We can't trust the insect. I'd like to
dialog: become... the first insect politician. You see, I'd like to, um... but,...
dialog: I'm afraid of...
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: I don't know what you're trying to say.
text: Brundle Steps forward, Veronica takes a step back and Brundle gazes up
text: through the skylight.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: I'm saying... I'm saying I-I'm an insect... who dreamt he was a man... and
text: loved it. But now the dream is over... and the insect is awake.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: No... no, Seth...
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: I'm saying... I'll hurt you if you stay.

scene_heading: EXT. BRUNDLES LAB- NIGHT
text: Veronica runs crying out of the lab. She is met by Stathis, who stands by the

speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Let's go! Let's do it now!
speaker_heading: STATHIS
dialog: Now? Wait, what did he say?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: I couldn't tell him! Let's go, damn it!
speaker_heading: STATHIS
dialog: No! I think we should wait a few days, i don't think you're in the right
dialog: frame of mind.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: No! I want it out of my body now! you should have seen him, there could be
dialog: anything in here! In me! In my body!
speaker_heading: STATHIS
dialog: I don't know if I can arrange it now, right now, tonight. Why do we have to
text: run around in the dark like a couple of...
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Because I don't want it in my body! Do you understand me? I don't want it in
dialog: my body!
text: As Veronica and Stathis drive off, we cut up to See Brundle watching from the

scene_heading: INT. DR. CHEEVERS OFFICE- NIGHT
text: DR CHEEVERS is sat at his Desk, while Veronica stares out of the Window.
text: Stathis stands behind her.
speaker_heading: CHEEVERS
dialog: Well, okay, what's the story?
speaker_heading: STATHIS
text: She's pregnant and she wants to have an abortion.
speaker_heading: CHEEVERS
dialog: In the middle of the night?
speaker_heading: STATHIS
dialog: We have good reason to believe that this child will be deformed.
speaker_heading: CHEEVERS
dialog: Yes, but in the middle of the night?
speaker_heading: STATHIS
dialog: Look Brent, Please.
speaker_heading: CHEEVERS
dialog: Is it your child?
speaker_heading: STATHIS
dialog: No, it's the... it's the child of a man who is deformed.
speaker_heading: CHEEVERS
dialog: Listen, I don't mean to interfere, but I detect a certain... uncertainty
dialog: here. You know there are tests we can do that determine whether or not...
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: I don't want tests done. Tests can't guarantee anything. The baby could start
dialog: off normal then become... I want an abortion, I'll do it myself if I have to.
text: CUT TO: THE OPERATING ROOM
speaker_heading: CHEEVERS
dialog: Okay if you can just slip into that, we'll be on our way in no time.
text: Stathis and Cheevers go into the other room, leaving Veronica alone.
text: Suddenly Brundle jumps through the window and walks towards Veronica.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Wait, Seth. No!
text: Brundle picks up Veronica and runs back out. Stathis runs into the room just
text: in time to glimple Brundle escape with Veronica.
scene_heading: EXT. A ROOFTOP- NIGHT
text: Brundle slowly puts Veronica down, and the talk.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Why did you want to kill Brundle? The baby might be all that's left of the

speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: I can't have it. I'm afraid.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Please, have the baby.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: I can't! I can't!
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Too bad. Too bad.
scene_heading: INT. BRUNDLES LAB- NIGHT
text: The door of Brundles lab slides open and Stathis Borans enters. He slides the
text: door shut behind him and we pan around to discover the lab is empty.
text: Stathis slowly walks, disgusted by his surroundings and the horrific
dialog: stench of the Lab.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Stathis opens his case and reveals a shotgun, which he loads and arms himself
text: with. He slowly walks over to Brundle's computer and presses a button which
dialog: brings down the fusion program:
dialog: Telepod 1: Transmitter of Subject A
dialog: Telepod 2: Transmitter of Subject B
dialog: Telepod 3: Recieve of genetically fused A-B combination Subject.
text: Stathis stares at the pods and behind him we glimpse the shadow of Brundlefly
text: on the roof above him. Brundle drops from the roof screaming and knocks
text: Stathis to the ground. Stathis looks up and is horrified by Brundle's
text: appearance. He tries to shoot, but Brundle overpowers him and pulls him to
text: his feet by clenching his wrist.
text: Brundle then proceeds to vomit onto Stathis's hand, which melts away
text: as Stathis screams. Brundle drops Stathis to the ground and then repeats the
text: process on Stathis's ankle, to which he then pulls away the foot.
text: Brundle stands up and raises his head above Stathis's He opens his
text: mouth and prepares to Vomit on Stathis's face.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: No! Don't! Don't please! Please...
text: Brundle stops and sees Veronica screaming from the skylight above him. He
text: moves quickly across the kitchen and slides up the wall and across the
text: ceiling on all fours until he is facing Veronica.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Help me. Help me be human.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Brundle, holding onto Veronica, jumps down into the lab. He puts her down
text: onto her feet and, holding her hand, explains the plan.
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: Well. I go there .and, uh you. go there. We come apart, then and then we
dialog: .come together there. You me and the baby; together!
text: Brundle starts the countdown for the fusion program.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: BRUNDLE
dialog: We'll be the ultimate family. A family of three joined together in one body.
dialog: More human than I am alone.
text: As Veronica tries to Pull away from Brundle, she rips his jaw off and flings
text: it to the floor, screaming. This starts of a chain reaction as Brundle dead
text: outer layer of Skin falls away to reveal the inner result of this mutation.
text: Brundle throws Veronica into Pod 1 and begins to climb into Pod 2.
text: Meanwhile, as the computer counts down, Stathis manages to prop
text: himself up a support beam.
text: When Brundle is locked inside the pod, Stathis shoots the cable
text: connecting Veronica's Pod to the computer, eliminating her from the fusion
dialog: program.
text: Stathis falls to the floor and crawls across to Veronica.
text: Brundle, meanwhile tries to escape from his pod by punching the glass
text: away. He succeeds, but as he opens the door and steps out, the computer
text: teleports him along with part of the door frame and telepod.
text: Veronica is freed from the pod and she helps Stathis sit up against
text: Pod 2. She picks up the shotgun as Brundle arrives in Pod 3. The door opens,
text: and out falls the helpless Brundle, physically fused with part of the door.
text: He slowsly crawls across to Veronica, who is in tears. He slowly places the
text: barrel of the shitgun to his forehead, indicating what he wants Veronica to
dialog: do.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: No, I can't.
text: Brundle voices a slow, painful moan.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: No, I can't. No... No, God!
text: Veronica pulls the trigger, killing Seth. She falls to the floor and begins
dialog: to sob.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT
dialog:
