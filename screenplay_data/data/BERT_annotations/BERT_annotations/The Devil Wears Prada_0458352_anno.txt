text: 1A A drawer filled with about forty lipsticks slides into 1A
text: frame... One of the GIRLS carefully applies shiny lip gloss
text: with a brush... ANDY puts on cherry Chapstick...
text: 1B&amp;C A lacy thong floats through the air... one of the GIRLS pulls 1B&amp;C
text: it up her glossy legs... A comfy cotton pair of Jockey
text: bikinis is tugged out of a pile... ANDY pulls them on...
text: 1D A gorgeous pair of slingback heels. One of the GIRLS pulls 1D
text: the shoes on while her model handsome boyfriend reclines on
text: crisp white sheets, watching her.
text: 1E A pair of comfortable wedges... ANDY dresses while NATE, 1E
text: rumpled, unshowered, wearing an old Alice in Chains t-shirt,
text: watches her, reclining in mismatched bed-in-a-bag sheets...
text: 1F&amp;G A series of quick cuts... ANDY eats a full breakfast -- eggs, 1F&amp;G
text: bacon, bagel... One of the GIRLS carefully counts out seven
text: almonds and pours a huge cup of black coffee...
text: 1H&amp;I ANDY straightens a pile of newspaper clips from the Daily 1H&amp;I
text: Northwestern with the byline ANDREA SACHS and proudly tucks

scene_heading: 2 EXT. NEW YORK CITY -- DAY 2

text: She gets to an intersection, starts to cross the street...
text: ...and just misses being decked by a bike messenger.
scene_heading: 5 EXT. ELIAS-CLARKE -- DAY 5
text: ANDY sees a tower looming in front of her. Elias-Clarke.

scene_heading: 8 INT. ELIAS-CLARKE HUMAN RESOURCES OFFICE -- DAY 8
text: ANDY sits across from SHERRY, 40's. On the wall are covers

speaker_heading: ANDY

speaker_heading: EMILY (O.S.)
dialog: Andrea Sachs?
text: (EMILY (and MIRANDA, later) pronounce ANDREA Ahn-DRAY-a. ANDY
dialog: refers to herself as AN-dree-a.)
text: ANDY turns and sees a taller, thinner and, amazingly, more
text: groomed CLACKER. This is EMILY. She looks the part of the

speaker_heading: EMILY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Yes. Of course. Who's Miranda?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: (eyes widening)
dialog: You didn't just ask me that. She's the
dialog: editor in chief of Runway. Not to
dialog: mention a legend. Work a year for her
dialog: and you can get a job at any magazine
dialog: you want. A million girls would kill
dialog: for this job.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Sounds great. I'd love to be
dialog: considered.
text: She smiles. EMILY tries to think how to break it to her.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Andrea, Runway is a fashion magazine.
dialog: An interest in fashion is crucial.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: What makes you think I'm not
dialog: interested in fashion?
text: EMILY gives her a look. ANDY smiles, like she has no idea

speaker_heading: EMILY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: NIGEL

speaker_heading: CLACKER
dialog: Sorry, Miranda.
text: MIRANDA doesn't acknowledge her existence.
scene_heading: 16 INT. RUNWAY - BULLPEN -- DAY 16

speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT'D)
dialog: (to the BARTENDER)
dialog: She'll have the punch.
dialog: (hands her the punch)

speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN

speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: Did you mention my good looks and

speaker_heading: ANDY

speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN

speaker_heading: ANDY

speaker_heading: ANDY

speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT'D)
dialog: I didn't want to do, say, a blonde in

scene_heading: 106 INT. RUNWAY - MIRANDA'S OFFICE -- DAY 106
text: We see the steak, prettily arranged on MIRANDA'S china. ANDY

speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: What is that doing here? I ordered it

speaker_heading: MIRANDA (CONT'D)

text: ANDY carries a tray with all the food on it into the kitchen.
text: A beat. She looks down at the tray. And suppresses an urge to

dialog: All right, well, thanks for trying.

speaker_heading: ANDY

scene_heading: 115A INT. RUNWAY - MIRANDA'S OFFICE -- DAY. 115A
text: MIRANDA, looking at the envelope.
text: And then we see ANDY. She stands there, quiet, calm.
text: And if MIRANDA is amazed by what ANDY did, she doesn't show
text: it. She opens the envelope, looks in.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: One copy? What are my twins supposed
dialog: to do with that... share?
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Actually I made two copies. And had
text: them color-copied, re-set and bound so

speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: After I called you, I realized... It

speaker_heading: NATE (CONT'D)
dialog: Let's see... How to buy a custom-made

speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: I get the point, Nate.

speaker_heading: ANDY

speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Come on, darling, let's get something

speaker_heading: EMILY

speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: I have to be at work in ten minutes.
dialog: What's up?
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: I just wanted to say...
text: She gathers her nerve.
speaker_heading: ANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Nate, you were right. About
dialog: everything. I turned my back on my
dialog: friends, my family, on everything I
dialog: believed in. And for what?
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Shoes. And jackets and belts and--
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Nate, I'm just... I'm so sorry.
text: Beat. He looks at her.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: I flew up to Boston while you were
text: gone. Interviewed at the Oak Room.
speaker_heading: ANDY

speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: You're looking at their new sous-chef.
dialog: I'm moving up there in a few weeks.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: That's great, I... congratulations.
text: A moment. As it sinks in what this means.
speaker_heading: ANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't know what I'm going to do
dialog: without those late night grilled
dialog: cheeses.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: They have bread in Boston. Might even
dialog: have Jarlsberg. We might be able to
dialog: figure something out.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: You think?
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: You never know.
text: They smile at each other. Friends, at least, for now.
speaker_heading: NATE (CONT'D)
dialog: So, how about you? What are you going
dialog: to do now?
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Not sure.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: I'm not worried about you. Anything
dialog: you try, you're gonna kick ass.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: You think so?
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: No. I know it.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Thanks. I actually have a job
dialog: interview today.
text: Beat. He looks her up and down.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: And that's what you're wearing?
dialog: 106A.

scene_heading: 195 INT. OFFICE -- DAY 195
text: ANDY sits across from a scruffy guy in his early forties.
speaker_heading: EDITOR
dialog: You know our pay is crap.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 107.

speaker_heading: 195 CONTINUED: 195
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: That's fine.
speaker_heading: EDITOR
dialog: Your clips were excellent. That thing
dialog: on the janitor's union... that's
dialog: exactly what we do here.
text: She smiles, humble now.
speaker_heading: EDITOR (CONT'D)
dialog: My only question is... Runway? What
dialog: the hell kind of blip was that?
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Learned a lot. In the end, though, I
dialog: kind of screwed it up.
speaker_heading: EDITOR
dialog: That's not what I hear.
text: ANDY looks at him, confused.
speaker_heading: EDITOR (CONT'D)
dialog: I called over there for a reference,
text: left word with some snooty girl, next
dialog: thing you know I got a fax from
dialog: Miranda Priestly herself--
text: ANDY blanches.
speaker_heading: EDITOR (CONT'D)
dialog: ...saying that of all the assistants
dialog: she had, you were by far her biggest
dialog: disappointment.
text: ANDY takes a deep breath...
speaker_heading: EDITOR (CONT'D)
dialog: And that if I don't hire you I'm an
dialog: idiot.
text: On ANDY, stunned.
speaker_heading: EDITOR (CONT'D)
dialog: You must have done something right.

scene_heading: 197 EXT. ELIAS CLARKE -- DAY 197
text: ANDY walks over to the Elias-Clarke building, looking at a
text: place that was, in its way, a home to her.
text: Her eyes sweep up the building to the Runway offices.
text: She takes out her cell phone.
scene_heading: 198 INT. RUNWAY - BULLPEN -- DAY 198
text: We see EMILY, back at her desk. The camera widens out so we
text: can see... a new SECOND ASSISTANT, eager and nervous. She is
text: showing EMILY a letter.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: My God, you call this a letter? Can
dialog: you spell any word in the English
dialog: language?
text: The phone rings. EMILY picks up.
speaker_heading: EMILY (CONT'D)
text: Miranda Priestly's office.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Emily, it's Andy. Don't hang up. I
dialog: have a favor to ask you.
scene_heading: 198A INT. RUNWAY -- BULLPEN -- DAY 198A
text: EMILY looks incredulous.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: You're joking. YOU have a favor to
dialog: ask of ME?
scene_heading: 198B EXT. STREET -- DAY 198B
text: ANDY is walking up the street, on her cell phone.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Thing is, I have all these clothes
dialog: from Paris and I don't have
dialog: anyplace to wear them, so I was
dialog: wondering... is there any way you
dialog: could take them off my hands?
text: Beat. EMILY realizes what ANDY is offering, but she won't let
dialog: that show...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 108A.
text: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
speaker_heading: 198B CONTINUED: 198B
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Well, I don't know. It is a huge
dialog: imposition, but I suppose I could
dialog: help you out... I'll have Roy pick
dialog: them up this afternoon.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Thanks, Emily. I appreciate it.
scene_heading: 198C INT. RUNWAY -- DAY 198C
text: And without a goodbye, EMILY hangs up. The slightest smile
text: creeps across EMILY'S face, but she quickly recovers, hands
text: the ASSISTANT the letter.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Why can't you be more like Andy?
scene_heading: 199 EXT. STREET -- DAY 199
text: ANDY hangs up her phone and smiles. And suddenly she sees
text: MIRANDA walk out of the building, on the phone.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: ...I don't understand why it's so
dialog: challenging to get a car when I ask
dialog: for one.
speaker_heading: EMILY (O.S.)
dialog: It should be there any second.
text: And at that moment the car edges into view. MIRANDA hangs up
text: and strides towards it.
text: And just then something catches MIRANDA'S eyes. ANDY,
text: watching her. They look at each other.
text: A beat.
text: And then ANDY nods her head -- in thanks, in salutation, and
dialog: in farewell...
text: But MIRANDA does not react. She gets into the car.
text: ANDY shakes her head. That's MIRANDA. She smiles, then turns
text: and starts to walk down the street.
dialog: 108B.
text: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
scene_heading: 200 INT. CAR -- DAY 200
text: MIRANDA gets in, sits back in her seat. Through her window
text: she can see ANDY, a bounce in her step, walking away...
text: And MIRANDA, alone, where no one can see her, finally breaks
text: into a real smile.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 109.
text: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
speaker_heading: 200 CONTINUED: 200
text: She nods to her driver. Let's go.
scene_heading: 201 EXT. STREET -- DAY 201
text: ANDY walks away, smiles, shakes her head, the whole thing
text: almost like a dream. And as she continues moving confidently
dialog: in the opposite direction from MIRANDA we...
