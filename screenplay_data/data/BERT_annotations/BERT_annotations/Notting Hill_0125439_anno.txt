dialog: Title
scene_heading: EXT. VARIOUS DAYS
dialog: 'She' plays through the credits.
dialog: Exquisite footage of Anna Scott -- the great movie star of our
dialog: time -- an ideal -- the perfect star and woman -- her life full of
dialog: glamour and sophistication and mystery.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY
dialog: Mix through to William, 35, relaxed, pleasant, informal. We
text: follow him as he walks down Portobello Road, carrying a load of
dialog: bread. It is spring.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM (V.O.)
dialog: Of course, I've seen her films and
dialog: always thought she was, well,
dialog: fabulous -- but, you know,
dialog: million miles from the world I live
dialog: in. Which is here -- Notting Hill
dialog: -- not a bad place to be...
scene_heading: EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAY
dialog: It's a full fruit market day.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM (V.O.)
dialog: There's the market on weekdays,
dialog: selling every fruit and vegetable
dialog: known to man...
scene_heading: EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAY
text: A man in denims exits the tattoo studio.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM (V.O.)
dialog: The tattoo parlour -- with a guy
dialog: outside who got drunk and now can't
dialog: remember why he chose 'I Love Ken'...
scene_heading: EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAY
speaker_heading: WILLIAM (V.O.)
dialog: The racial hair-dressers where
text: everyone comes out looking like the
dialog: Cookie Monster, whether they like
dialog: it or not...
text: Sure enough, a girl exits with a huge threaded blue bouffant.
scene_heading: EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - SATURDAY
speaker_heading: WILLIAM (V.O.)
dialog: Then suddenly it's the weekend, and
dialog: from break of day, hundreds of stalls
text: appears out of nowhere, filling
dialog: Portobello Road right up to Notting
dialog: Hill Gate...
text: A frantic crowded Portobello market.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM (V.O.)
dialog: ... and thousands of people buy
dialog: millions of antiques, some genuine...
text: The camera finally settles on a stall selling beautiful stained
text: glass windows of various sizes, some featuring biblical scenes
dialog: and saints.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM (V.O.)
dialog: ... and some not so genuine.
scene_heading: EXT. GOLBORNE ROAD - DAY
speaker_heading: WILLIAM (V.O.)
dialog: And what's great is that lots of
dialog: friends have ended up in this part of
dialog: London -- that's Tony, architect
dialog: turned chef, who recently invested
dialog: all the money he ever earned in a new
dialog: restaurant...
text: Shot of Tony proudly setting out a board outside his restaurant,
text: the sign still being painted. He receives and approves a huge
dialog: fresh salmon.
scene_heading: EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAY
speaker_heading: WILLIAM (V.O.)
dialog: So this is where I spend my days
dialog: and years -- in this small village in
text: the middle of a city -- in a house
dialog: with a blue door that my wife and I
dialog: bought together... before she left
dialog: me for a man who looked like Harrison
dialog: Ford, only even handsomer...
text: We arrive outside his blue-doored house just off Portobello.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM (V.O.)
dialog: ... and where I now lead a strange
dialog: half-life with a lodger called...
scene_heading: INT. WILLIAM'S HOUSE - DAY
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Spike!
dialog: The house has far too many things in it. Definitely two-
dialog: bachelor flat.
text: Spike appears. An unusual looking fellow. He has unusual
dialog: hair, unusual facial hair and an unusual Welsh accent: very
text: white, as though his flesh has never seen the sun. He wears
dialog: only shorts.
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: Even he. Hey, you couldn't help me
dialog: with an incredibly important
dialog: decision, could you?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: This is important in comparison to,
dialog: let's say, whether they should
dialog: cancel third world debt?
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: That's right -- I'm at last going out
dialog: on a date with the great Janine and I
dialog: just want to be sure I've picked the
dialog: right t-shirt.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: What are the choices?
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: Well... wait for it...
text: (He pulls on a t-shirt)
dialog: First there's this one...
text: The t-shirt is white with a horrible looking plastic alien
text: coming out of it, jaws open, blood everywhere. It says 'I Love
dialog: Blood.'
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Yes -- might make it hard to strike a
dialog: really romantic note.
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: Point taken.
text: He heads back up the stairs... talks as he changes...
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: I suspect you'll prefer the next one.
text: And he re-enters in a white t-shirt, with a large arrow,
dialog: pointing down to his flies, saying, 'Get It Here.'
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: Cool, huh?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Yes -- she might think you don't have
dialog: true love on your mind.
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: Wouldn't want that...
dialog: (and back up he goes)
dialog: Okay -- just one more.
dialog: He comes down wearing it. Lots of hearts, saying, 'You're the
dialog: most beautiful woman in the world.'
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Well, yes, that's perfect. Well
dialog: done.
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: Thanks. Great. Wish me luck.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Good luck.
text: Spike turns and walks upstairs proudly. Revealing that on the
text: back of the t-shirt, also printed in big letters, is written
dialog: 'Fancy a fuck?'
scene_heading: EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAY
speaker_heading: WILLIAM (V.O.)
dialog: And so it was just another hopeless
dialog: Wednesday, as I set off through the
dialog: market to work, little suspecting
dialog: that this was the day which would
dialog: change my life forever. This is
dialog: work, by the way, my little travel
dialog: book shop...
dialog: A small unpretentious store... named 'The Travel Book Co.'
speaker_heading: WILLIAM (V.O.)
dialog: ... which, well, sells travel books
dialog: -- and, to be frank with you, doesn't
dialog: always sell many of those.
text: William enters.
scene_heading: INT. THE BOOKSHOP - DAY
text: It is a small shop, slightly chaotic, bookshelves everywhere,
text: with little secret bits round corners with even more books.
text: Martin, William's sole employee, is waiting enthusiastically.
text: He is very keen, an uncrushable optimist. Perhaps without
text: cause. A few seconds later, William stands gloomily behind the
dialog: desk.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Classic. Absolutely classic.
dialog: Profit from major sales push -- minus
speaker_heading: £347.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Shall I go get a cappuccino? Ease the
dialog: pain.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Yes, better get me a half. All I can
dialog: afford.
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: I get your logic. Demi-capu coming up.
text: He salutes and bolts out the door -- as he does, a woman walks in.
dialog: We only just glimpse her.
text: Cut to William working. He looks up casually. And sees
text: something. His reaction is hard to read. After a pause...
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Can I help you?
dialog: It is Anna Scott, the biggest movie star in the world -- here --
text: in his shop. The most divine, subtle, beautiful woman on earth.
text: When she speaks she is very self-assured and self-contained.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: No, thanks. I'll just look around.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Fine.
text: She wanders over to a shelf as he watches her -- and picks out a
dialog: quite smart coffee table book.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: That book's really not good -- just
dialog: in case, you know, browsing turned to
dialog: buying. You'd be wasting your money.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Yes. This one though is... very
dialog: good.
text: He picks up a book on the counter.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: I think the man who wrote it has
dialog: actually been to Turkey, which helps.
dialog: There's also a very amusing incident
text: with a kebab.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Thanks. I'll think about it.
text: William suddenly spies something odd on the small TV monitor
dialog: beside him.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: If you could just give me a second.
text: Her eyes follow him as he moves toward the back of the shop and
text: approaches a man in slightly ill-fitting clothes.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Excuse me.
speaker_heading: THIEF
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Bad news.
speaker_heading: THIEF
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: We've got a security camera in this
dialog: bit of the shop.
speaker_heading: THIEF
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: So, I saw you put that book down your
dialog: trousers.
speaker_heading: THIEF
dialog: What book?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: The one down your trousers.
speaker_heading: THIEF
dialog: I haven't got a book down my trousers.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Right -- well, then we have something
dialog: of an impasse. I tell you what --
dialog: I'll call the police -- and, what can
dialog: I say? -- If I'm wrong about the whole
dialog: book-down-the-trousers scenario, I
dialog: really apologize.
speaker_heading: THIEF
dialog: Okay -- what if I did have a book down
dialog: my trousers?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Well, ideally, when I went back to
dialog: the desk, you'd remove the Cadogan
dialog: guide to Bali from your trousers, and
dialog: either wipe it and put it back, or
dialog: buy it. See you in a sec.
text: He returns to his desk. In the monitor we just glimpse, as does
text: William, the book coming out of the trousers and put back on the
text: shelves. The thief drifts out towards the door. Anna, who has
text: observed all this, is looking at a blue book on the counter.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Sorry about that...
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: No, that's fine. I was going to
dialog: steal one myself but now I've changed
dialog: my mind. Signed by the author, I see.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Yes, we couldn't stop him. If you
dialog: can find an unsigned copy, it's
dialog: worth an absolute fortune.
text: She smiles. Suddenly the thief is there.
speaker_heading: THIEF
dialog: Excuse me.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: THIEF
dialog: Can I have your autograph?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: What's your name?
speaker_heading: THIEF
dialog: Rufus.
text: She signs his scruffy piece of paper. He tries to read it.
speaker_heading: THIEF
dialog: What does it say?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Well, that's the signature -- and
dialog: above, it says 'Dear Rufus -- you
dialog: belong in jail.'
speaker_heading: THIEF
dialog: Nice one. Would you like my phone
dialog: number?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Tempting but... no, thank you.
text: Thief leaves.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I think I will try this one.
text: She hands William a £20 note and the book he said was rubbish.
text: He talks as he handles the transaction.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Oh -- right -- on second thoughts
dialog: maybe it wasn't that bad. Actually
dialog: -- it's a sort of masterpiece really.
dialog: None of those childish kebab
dialog: stories you get in so many travel
dialog: books these days. And I'll throw in
dialog: one of these for free.
text: He drops in one of the signed books.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Very useful for lighting fires,
dialog: wrapping fish, that sort of things.
text: She looks at him with a slight smile.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Thanks.
text: And leaves. She's out of his life forever. William is a little
text: dazed. Seconds later Martin comes back in.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Cappuccino as ordered.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Thanks. I don't think you'll believe
dialog: who was just in here.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Who? Someone famous?
text: But William's innate natural English discretion takes over.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: No. No-one -- no-one.
text: They set about drinking their coffees.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Would be exciting if someone famous
dialog: did come into the shop though,
dialog: wouldn't it? Do you know -- this is
dialog: pretty incredible actually -- I once
dialog: saw Ringo Starr. Or at least I think
dialog: it was Ringo. It might have been
dialog: that broke from 'Fiddler On The Roof,'
dialog: Toppy.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Topol.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: That's right -- Topol.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: But Ringo Starr doesn't look
dialog: anything like Topol.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: No, well... he was quite a long way
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: So it could have been neither of them?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: I suppose so.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Right. It's not a classic anecdotes,
dialog: is it?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Not classic, no.
text: Martin shakes his head. William drains his cappuccino.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Right -- want another one?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Yes. No, wait -- let's go crazy --
dialog: I'll have an orange juice.
scene_heading: EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAY
text: William sets off.
scene_heading: INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY
text: William collects his juice in a coffee shop on Westbourne Park
dialog: Road.
scene_heading: EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAY
text: William swings out of the little shop -- he turns the corner of
text: Portobello Road and bumps straight into Anna. The orange
text: juice, in its foam cup, flies. It soaks Anna.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Oh Jesus.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Here, let me help.
text: He grabs some paper napkins and starts to clean it off -- getting
text: far too near her breasts in the panic of it...
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: What are you doing?!
text: He jumps back.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Nothing, nothing... Look, I live just
dialog: over the street -- you could get
dialog: cleaned up.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: No thank you. I need to get my car
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: I also have a phone. I'm confident
dialog: that in five minutes we can have you
text: spick and span and back on the street
dialog: again... in the non-prostitute sense
dialog: obviously.
text: In his diffident way, he is confident, despite her being
text: genuinely annoyed. She turns and looks at him.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Okay. So what does 'just over the
dialog: street' mean -- give it to me in yards.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Eighteen yards. That's my house
dialog: there.
text: He doesn't lie -- it is eighteen yards away. She looks down.
text: She looks up at him.
scene_heading: INT. WILLIAM'S HOUSE - CORRIDOR - DAY
text: They enter. She carries a few stylish bags.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Come on in. I'll just...
text: William runs in further -- it's a mess. He kicks some old shoes
text: under the stairs, bins an unfinished pizza and hides a plate of
text: breakfast in a cupboard. She enters the kitchen.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: It's not that tidy, I fear.
text: And he guides her up the stairs, after taking the bag of books
dialog: from her...
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
text: The bathroom is right at the top of
text: the stairs and there's a phone on the
dialog: desk up there.
text: She heads upstairs.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - DAY
text: William is tidying up frantically. Then he hears Anna's feet on
text: the stairs. She walks down, wearing a short, sparkling black
text: top beneath her leather jacket. With her trainers still on. He
text: is dazzled by the sight of her.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Would you like a cup of tea before
dialog: you go?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: No thanks.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Coffee?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Orange juice -- probably not.
text: He moves to his very empty fridge -- and offers its only contents.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Something else cold -- coke, water,
dialog: some disgusting sugary drink
dialog: pretending to have something to do
dialog: with fruits of the forest?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Really, no.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Would you like something to nibble --
dialog: apricots, soaked in honey -- quite
dialog: why, no one knows -- because it stops
dialog: them tasting of apricots, and makes
dialog: them taste like honey, and if you
dialog: wanted honey, you'd just buy honey,
dialog: instead of apricots, but nevertheless
dialog: -- there we go -- yours if you want
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Do you always say 'no' to everything?
text: Pause. She looks at him deep.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: No.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I better be going. Thanks for your
dialog: help.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: You're welcome and, may I also say...
dialog: heavenly.
dialog: It has taken a lot to get this out loud. He is not a smooth-
dialog: talking man.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Take my one chance to say it. After
dialog: you've read that terrible book,
dialog: you're certainly not going to be
text: coming back to the shop.
text: She smiles. She's cool.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Yes. Well. My pleasure.
text: He guides her towards the door.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Nice to meet you. Surreal but nice.
text: In a slightly awkward moment, he shows her out the door. He
text: closes the door and shakes his head in wonder. Then...
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: 'Surreal but nice.' What was I
dialog: thinking?
text: ... He shakes his head again in horror and wanders back along
text: the corridor in silence. There's a knock on the door. He moves
dialog: back, casually...
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Coming.
text: He opens the door. It's her.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Oh hi. Forget something?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I forgot my bag.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Oh right.
text: He shoots into the kitchen and picks up the forgotten shopping
text: bag. Then returns and hands it to her.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Here we go.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Thanks. Well...
text: They stand in that corridor -- in that small space. Second time
text: saying goodbye. A strange feeling of intimacy. She leans
text: forward and she kisses him. Total silence. A real sense of the
text: strangeness of those lips, those famous lips on his. They part.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: I apologize for the 'surreal but nice'
dialog: comment. Disaster...
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Don't worry about it. I thought the
dialog: apricot and honey business was the
dialog: real lowpoint.
text: Suddenly there is a clicking of a key in the lock.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Oh my God. My flatmate. I'm sorry --
dialog: there's no excuse for him.
text: Spike walks in.
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Hi.
text: Spike walks past unsuspiciously and heads into the kitchen.
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: I'm just going to go into the kitchen
dialog: to get some food -- and then I'm going
dialog: to tell you a story that will make your
text: balls shrink to the size of raisins.
text: And leaves them in the corridor.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Probably best not tell anyone about
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Right. No one. I mean, I'll tell
dialog: myself sometimes but... don't worry
dialog: -- I won't believe it.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Bye.
text: And she leaves, with just a touch of William's hand. Spike
text: comes out of the kitchen, eating something white out of a
text: styrofoam container with a spoon.
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: There's something wrong with this
dialog: yogurt.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: It's not yogurt -- it's mayonnaise.
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: Well, there you go.
dialog: (takes another big spoonful)
dialog: On for a video fest tonight? I've
dialog: got some absolute classic.
scene_heading: INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: The lights are off. William and Spike on the couch, just the
text: light from the TV playing on their faces. Cut to the TV full
text: screen. There is Anna. She is in a stylish Woody Allen type
text: modern romantic comedy, 'Gramercy Park,' in black and white.
scene_heading: INT. MANHATTAN ART GALLERY - DAY
text: Anna's character -- Woody Anna -- is walking around the gallery
dialog: with her famous co-star, Michael. They should be the perfect
text: couple, but there is tension. Anna is not happy.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Smile.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Smile.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I've got nothing to smile about.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Okay in about 7 seconds, I'm going to
dialog: ask you to marry me.
text: And after a couple of seconds -- wow -- she smiles.
scene_heading: INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: Imagine -- somewhere in the world
dialog: there's a man who's allowed to kiss
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Yes, she is fairly fabulous.
scene_heading: INT. BOOKSHOP - DAY
text: The next day. William and Martin quietly co-existing. An annoy-
text: ing customer enters. Mr. Smith.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: Do you have any books by Dickens?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: No, we're a travel bookshop. We only
dialog: sell travel books.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: Oh right. How about that new John
dialog: Grisham thriller?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: No, that's a novel too.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: Oh right. Have you got a copy of
dialog: 'Winnie the Pooh'?
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Martin -- your customer.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Can I help you?
text: William looks up. At that moment the entire window is suddenly
text: taken up by the huge side of a bus, obscuring the light -- and
text: entirely covered with a portrait of Anna -- from her new film,
dialog: 'Helix.'
scene_heading: INT. WILLIAM'S HOUSE - CONDOR/LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: William heads upstairs and pauses. Spike coming down, wearing
text: full body scuba diving gear.
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Hi...
scene_heading: INT. WILLIAM'S KITCHEN - DAY
text: The two of them fixing a cup of tea in the kitchen.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Just incidentally -- why are you
dialog: wearing that?
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: Ahm -- combination of factors really.
dialog: No clean clothes...
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: There never will be, you know, unless
dialog: you actually clean your clothes.
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: Right. Vicious circle. And then I was
dialog: like rooting around in your things,
dialog: and found this, and I thought -- cool.
dialog: Kind of spacey.
scene_heading: EXT. WILLIAM'S TERRACE - DAY
text: The two of them on the rooftop terrace, passing the day.
text: William is reading 'The bookseller.' The terrace is small and
dialog: the plants aren't great -- but it overlooks London in a rather
text: wonderful way. Spike still in scuba gear, goggles on.
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: There's something wrong with the
dialog: goggles though...
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: No, they were prescription, so I could
dialog: see all the fishes properly.
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: Groovy. You should do more of this
dialog: stuff.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: So -- any messages?
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: Yeh, I wrote a couple down.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Two? That's it?
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: You want me to write down all your
dialog: messages?
text: William closes his eyes in exasperation.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Who were the ones you didn't write
dialog: down from?
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: Ahm let's see -- ahm. No. Gone
dialog: completely. Oh no, wait. There was --
dialog: one from your mum: she said don't
dialog: forget lunch and her leg's hurting
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Right. No one else?
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: Absolutely not.
text: Spike leans back and relaxes.
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: Though if we're going for this
dialog: obsessive writing-down-all-messages
dialog: thing -- some American girl called
dialog: Anna called a few days ago.
text: William freezes -- then looks at Spike.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: What did she say?
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: Well, it was genuinely bizarre...
dialog: she said, hi -- it's Anna -- and then
dialog: she said, call me at the Ritz -- and
dialog: then gave herself a completely
dialog: different name.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Which was?
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: Absolutely no idea. Remembering one
dialog: name's bad enough...
scene_heading: INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: William on the phone. We hear the formal man at the other end of
text: the phone. And then intercut with him.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: RITZ MAN (V.O.)
dialog: May I help you, sir?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Ahm, look this is a very odd
dialog: situation. I'm a friend of Anna
dialog: Scott's -- and she rang me at home the
dialog: day before yesterday -- and left a
dialog: message saying she's staying with
dialog: you...
scene_heading: INT. RITZ RECEPTION - DAY
speaker_heading: RITZ MAN
dialog: I'm sorry, we don't have anyone of
dialog: that name here, sir.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: No, that's right -- I know that. She
dialog: said she's using another name -- but
dialog: the problem is she left the message
dialog: with my flatmate, which was a serious
dialog: mistake.
scene_heading: INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM
speaker_heading: WILLIAM (cont'd)
dialog: Imagine if you will the stupidest
dialog: person you've ever met -- are you
dialog: doing that...?
text: Spike happens to be in the foreground of this shot. He's read-
dialog: ing a newspaper.
speaker_heading: RITZ MAN
dialog: Yes, sir. I have him in my mind.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: And then double it -- and that is the
dialog: -- what can I say -- git I'm living
dialog: with and he cannot remember...
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: Try 'Flintstone.'
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: (to Spike)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: I think she said her name was
dialog: 'Flintstone.'
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Does 'Flintstone' mean anything to
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: RITZ MAN
dialog: I'll put you right through, sir.
dialog: Flintstone is indeed the magic word.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Oh my God.
dialog: He practices how to sound.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Hello. Hi. Hi.
speaker_heading: ANNA (V.O.)
dialog: Hi.
dialog: We hear her voice -- don't see her.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: (caught out)
dialog: Oh hi. It's William Thacker. We,
dialog: ahm I work in a bookshop.
speaker_heading: ANNA (V.O.)
dialog: You played it pretty cool here,
dialog: waiting for three days to call.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: No, I've never played anything cool
dialog: in my entire life. Spike, who I'll
dialog: stab to death later, never gave me the
dialog: message.
speaker_heading: ANNA (V.O.)
dialog: Oh -- Okay.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Perhaps I could drop round for tea or
dialog: something?
speaker_heading: ANNA (V.O.)
dialog: Yeh -- unfortunately, things are
dialog: going to be pretty busy, but... okay,
dialog: let's give it a try. Four o'clock
dialog: could be good.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Right. Great.
dialog: (he hangs up)
dialog: Classic. Classic.
scene_heading: EXT. RITZ - DAY
text: William jumps off a bus and walks toward the Ritz. He carries a
text: small bunch of roses.
scene_heading: INT. RITZ HOTEL - DAY
text: He approaches the lifts. At the lift, he pushes the button and
text: the doors open. As he is getting in, William is joined by a young
dialog: man. His name is Tarquin.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Which floor?
speaker_heading: TARQUIN
dialog: Three.
text: William pushes the button. They wait for the doors to close.
scene_heading: INT. RITZ CORRIDOR - DAY
text: The lift lands. William gets out. So does Tarquin. Rooms
text: 30-35 are to the left. 35-39 to the right. William heads right.
dialog: So does Tarquin.
text: William is puzzled. He slows down as he approaches room 38. So
text: does Tarquin. William spots, so does Tarquin. William points
dialog: at the number.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Are you sure you...?
speaker_heading: TARQUIN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Oh. Right.
text: He knocks. A bright, well-tailored American girl opens the door.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Hello, I'm Karen. Sorry -- things
dialog: are running a bit late. Here's the
dialog: thing...
text: She hands them a very slick, expensively produced press kits,
dialog: with the poster picture of Anna, for the film 'Helix.'
scene_heading: INT. THE TRAFALGAR SUITE ANTE-ROOM - DAY
text: A few seconds later -- they enter the main waiting room. There
text: are a number of journalists waiting for their audience.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: What did you think of the film?
speaker_heading: TARQUIN
dialog: Marvellous. 'Close Encounters'
dialog: meets 'Jean De Florette.' Oscar-
dialog: winning stuff.
text: They both turn to William for his opinion.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: I agree.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: I'm sorry. I didn't get down what
dialog: magazines you're from.
speaker_heading: TARQUIN
dialog: 'Time Out.'
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Great. And you...
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: (seeing it on a coffee
dialog: table)
dialog: 'Horse and Hound.' The name's
dialog: William Whacker. I think she might
dialog: be expecting me.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Okay -- take a seat. I'll check.
text: They sit down as Karen goes off.
speaker_heading: TARQUIN
dialog: You've brought her flowers?
text: William goes for the cover-up.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: No -- they're... for my grandmother.
text: She's in a hospital nearby. Thought
dialog: I'd kill two birds with one stone.
speaker_heading: TARQUIN
dialog: I'm sorry. Which hospital?
dialog: Pause. He's in trouble.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Do you mind me not saying -- it's a
dialog: rather distressing disease and the
dialog: name of the hospital rather gives it
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: TARQUIN
dialog: Oh sure. Of course.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Mr. Thacker.
text: Saved by the bell.
scene_heading: INT. TRAFALGAR SUIT CORRIDOR - DAY
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: You've got five minutes.
text: He is shown in through big golden doors. Karen stays outside.
scene_heading: INT. THE TRAFALGAR SUITE SITTING ROOM - DAY
text: There Anna is, framed in the window. Glorious.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: I brought these, but clearly...
text: There are lots of other flowers in the room.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Oh no, ho -- these are great.
dialog: A fair amount of tension. These two people hardly know each
dialog: other -- and the first and last time they met, they kissed.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Sorry about not ringing back. The
dialog: whole two-names concept was totally too
dialog: much for my flatman's pea-sized
dialog: intellect.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: No, it's a stupid privacy thing. I
dialog: always choose a cartoon character --
dialog: last time out, I was Mrs. Bambi.
text: At which moment Jeremy, Karen's boss, comes in. A fairly grave,
text: authoritative fifty-year-old PR man consulting a list.
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: Everything okay?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Yes, thanks.
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: And you are from 'Horse and Hound'
dialog: magazine?
dialog: William nods.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Is that so?
text: William shrugs his shoulders. Jeremy settles at a little desk
text: in the corner and makes notes. A pause. William feels he has to
text: act the part. They sit in chairs opposite each other.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: So I'll just fire away, shall I?
dialog: Anna nods.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Right. Ahm... the film's great...
dialog: and I just wondered -- whether you
dialog: ever thought of having more...
dialog: horses in it?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to
dialog: -- but it was difficult, obviously,
text: being set in space.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Obviously. Very difficult.
dialog: Jeremy leaves.
text: William puts his head in his hands. He was panic.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: I'm sorry -- I arrived outside -- they
dialog: thrust this thing into my hand -- I
dialog: didn't know what to do.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: No, it's my fault, I thought this
dialog: would all be over by now. I just
dialog: wanted to sort of apologize for the
dialog: kissing thing. I seriously don't
dialog: know what got in to me. I just wanted
dialog: to make sure you were fine about it.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Absolutely fine about it.
dialog: Re-enter Jeremy.
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: Do remember that Miss Scott is also
dialog: keen to talk about her next project,
text: which is shooting later in the summer.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Oh yes -- excellent. Ahm -- any horses
dialog: in that one? Or hounds, of course. Our
dialog: readers are equally intrigued by both
dialog: species.
speaker_heading: ANNA
text: It takes place on a submarine.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Yes. Right... But if there were horses,
dialog: would you be riding them yourself or
dialog: would you be getting a stunt horse person
dialog: double sort of thing?
dialog: Jeremy exits.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: I'm just a complete moron. Sorry.
dialog: This is the sort of thing that happens
dialog: in dreams -- not in real life. Good
dialog: dreams, obviously -- it's a dream to
dialog: see you.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: And what happens next in the dream?
dialog: It's a challenge.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Well, I suppose in the dream dream
dialog: scenario. I just... ahm, change my
dialog: personality, because you can do that
text: in dreams, and walk across and kiss the
dialog: girl but you know it'll never happen.
text: Pause. Then they move towards each other when... Jeremy
dialog: enters.
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: Time's up, I'm afraid. Sorry it was
dialog: so short. Did you get what you wanted?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Very nearly.
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: Maybe time for one last question?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Right.
dialog: Jeremy goes out -- it's their last seconds.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Are you busy tonight?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Yes.
text: They look at each other. Jeremy enters, with another journalists
text: in tow. Anna and William stand and shake hands formally.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Well, it was nice to meet you.
dialog: Surreal but nice.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Thank you. You are 'Horse and Hound's'
dialog: favorite actress. You and Black
dialog: Beauty. Tied.
scene_heading: INT. TRAFALGAR SUITE CORRIDOR - DAY
text: William exits fairly despondent and heads for the door. Tarquin
text: is in the corridor calling on his mobile phone.
speaker_heading: TARQUIN
dialog: How was she?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Fabulous.
speaker_heading: TARQUIN
dialog: Wait a minute -- she took your
dialog: grandmother's flowers?
dialog: William can't think his way out of this.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Yes. That's right. Bitch.
text: He turns to go, but is accosted by Karen.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: If you'd like to come with me we can
dialog: rush you through the others.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: The others?
scene_heading: INT. RITZ INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Mr. Thacker's from 'Horse and Hound.'
text: A forty-year-old actor with great presence warmly shakes
text: William's hand.
speaker_heading: MALE LEAD
dialog: Pleased to meet you. Did you like the
dialog: film?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Ah... yes, enormously.
speaker_heading: MALE LEAD
dialog: Well, fire away.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Right, right. Ahm -- did you enjoy
dialog: making the film?
speaker_heading: MALE LEAD
dialog: I did.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Any bit in particular?
speaker_heading: MALE LEAD
dialog: Well, you tell me which bit you liked
dialog: most -- and I'll tell you if I enjoyed
dialog: making it.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Ahm right, right, I liked the bit in
dialog: space very much. Did you enjoy
dialog: making that bit?
scene_heading: INT. RITZ INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY
text: Same room same seat, minutes later, with a monolingual foreign
dialog: actor and an interpreter.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Did you identify with the character
dialog: you were playing?
speaker_heading: INTERPRETER
dialog: Te identicaste con el personaje que
dialog: interpretabas?
speaker_heading: FOREIGN ACTOR
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: INTERPRETER
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Ah. Why not?
speaker_heading: INTERPRETER
dialog: Por que no?
speaker_heading: FOREIGN ACTOR
dialog: Porque es un robot carnivoro
dialog: psicopata.
speaker_heading: INTERPRETER
text: Because he is playing a psychopathic
text: flesh-eating robot.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Classic.
scene_heading: INT. RITZ INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY
text: And now William is sitting opposite an eleven-year-old American
dialog: girl.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Is this your first film?
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: No -- it's my 22nd.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Of course it is. Any favourite among
dialog: the 22?
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Working with Leonardo.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Da Vinci?
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Di Caprio.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Of course. And is he your favourite
dialog: Italian film director?
scene_heading: INT. RITZ CORRIDOR - DAY
text: William emerges traumatized into the corridor. It is full of
dialog: camera crews. And there is Karen.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Mr. Thacker?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: (so weary)
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Have you got a moment?
scene_heading: INT. ANNA'S SUITE SITTING ROOM - DAY
text: They knock on her door.
speaker_heading: ANNA (V.O.)
dialog: Come in.
text: William enters. A certain nervousness. They are alone again.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Ahm. That thing I was doing tonight
dialog: -- I'm not doing it any more. I told
dialog: them I had to spend the evening with
dialog: Britain's premier equestrian
dialog: journalist.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Oh well, great. Perfect. Oh no --
dialog: shittity brickitty -- it's my sister's
dialog: birthday -- shit -- we're meant to be
dialog: having dinner.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Okay -- fine.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: But no, I'm sure I can get out of it.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: No, I mean, if it's fine with you,
dialog: I'll, you know, be your date.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: You'll be my date at my little sister's
dialog: birthday party?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: If that's all right.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: I'm sure it's all right. My friend
dialog: Max is cooking and he's acknowledged
dialog: to be the worst cook in the world, but
dialog: you know, you could hide the food in
dialog: your handbag or something.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Okay.
scene_heading: INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Bella and Max are in the kitchen.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: He's bringing a girl?
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: Miracles do happen.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Does the girl have a name?
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: He wouldn't say.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Christ, what is going on in there?
text: The oven seems to be smoking a little. Then the bell rings.
speaker_heading: MAX (cont'd)
dialog: Oh God.
text: It's bad timing. Max shoots out of the kitchen.
scene_heading: INT. MAX AND BELLA'S CORRIDOR - NIGHT
text: Max heads for the door impatiently. He opens it and turns back
text: without looking at William and Anna standing there.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Come on in. Vague food crisis.
text: William and Anna move along the corridor to the kitchen.
scene_heading: INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: Bella is there.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: Hiya -- sorry -- the guinea fowl is
dialog: proving more complicated than
dialog: expected.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: He's cooking guinea fowl?
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: Don't even ask.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: Hi. Good Lord -- you're the spitting
dialog: image of...
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Bella -- this is Anna.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: Right.
dialog: (pause)
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Okay. Crisis over.
text: He rises from his stove position.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Max. This is Anna.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Hello, Anna ahm...
dialog: (He recognizes her -- the
dialog: word just falls out)
dialog: Scott -- have some wine.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: Door bell goes.
scene_heading: INT. MAX AND BELLA'S CORRIDOR - NIGHT
text: Max opens the door -- it is Honey.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Hi.
text: She does a little pose, having worn a real party dress.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Yes, Happy Birthday.
text: They head back along the corridor.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Look, your brother has brought this
dialog: girl, and ahm...
scene_heading: INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: They enter the kitchen.
speaker_heading: HONEY
dialog: Hi guys.
dialog: (sees Anna)
dialog: Oh holy fuck.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Hun -- this is Anna. Anna -- this is
dialog: Honey -- she's my baby sitter.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Hiya.
speaker_heading: HONEY
dialog: Oh God this is one of those key moments
dialog: in life, when it's possible you can be
dialog: really, genuinely cool -- and I'm going
dialog: to fail a hundred percent. I absolutely
dialog: and totally and utterly adore you and I
dialog: think you're the most beautiful woman
dialog: in the world and more importantly I
dialog: genuinely believe and have believed for
dialog: some time now that we can be best
dialog: friends. What do you think?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Ahm... I think that sounds -- you know
dialog: -- lucky me. Happy Birthday.
text: She hands her a present.
speaker_heading: HONEY
dialog: Oh my God. You gave me a present.
dialog: We're best friends already. Marry
dialog: Will -- he's a really nice guy and
dialog: then we can be sisters.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I'll think about it.
text: The front door bell goes.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: That'll be Bernie.
text: He heads out into the corridor to the front door.
scene_heading: INT. MAX AND BELLA'S CORRIDOR - NIGHT
text: Max opens the door.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Hello, Bernie.
speaker_heading: BERNIE
dialog: I'm sorry I'm so late. Bollocksed up
dialog: at work again, I fear. Millions down
dialog: the drain.
scene_heading: INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: They enter the room.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Bernie -- this is Anna.
speaker_heading: BERNIE
dialog: Hello, Anna. Delighted to meet you.
text: Doesn't recognize her -- turns to Honey.
speaker_heading: BERNIE
dialog: Honey Bunny -- happy birthday to you.
dialog: (hands her a present)
dialog: It's a hat. You don't have to wear
dialog: it or anything.
scene_heading: INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: A minute or two later -- they are standing, drinking wine before
text: dinner. Bernie with Anna on their own -- William helping Max in
dialog: the kitchen.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You haven't slept with her, have you?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: That is a cheap question and the answer
dialog: is, of course, no comment.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: 'No comment' means 'yes.'
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: No, it doesn't.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Do you ever masturbate?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Definitely no comment.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You see -- it means 'yes.'
text: Then on to Bernie's conversation.
speaker_heading: BERNIE
dialog: So tell me Anna -- what do you do?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I'm an actress.
speaker_heading: BERNIE
dialog: Splendid. I'm actually in the stock-
dialog: market, so not really similar fields,
dialog: though I have done some amateur stuff
dialog: -- P.G. Wodehouse, you know -- farce,
dialog: all that. 'Ooh -- careful there,
dialog: vicar.' Always imagined it's a
dialog: pretty tough job, though, acting.
dialog: I mean the wages are a scandal,
dialog: aren't they?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Well, they can be.
speaker_heading: BERNIE
dialog: I see friends from university --
dialog: clever chaps -- been in the business
dialog: longer than you -- they're scraping
dialog: by on seven, eight thousand a year.
dialog: It's no life. What sort of acting
dialog: do you do?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Films mainly.
speaker_heading: BERNIE
dialog: Oh splendid. Well done. How's the
dialog: pay in movies? I mean, last film you
dialog: did, what did you get paid?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Fifteen million dollars.
speaker_heading: BERNIE
dialog: Right. Right. So that's... fairly
dialog: good. On the high side... have you
dialog: tried the nuts?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Right -- I think we're ready.
text: They all move towards the kitchen.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (to Bella)
dialog: I wonder if you could tell me where
dialog: the...?
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: Oh, it's just down the corridor on
dialog: the right.
speaker_heading: HONEY
dialog: I'll show you.
text: A moment's silence as they leave -- then in a split second the
dialog: others all turn to William.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: Quickly, quickly -- talk very quickly
dialog: what are you doing here with Anna
dialog: Scott?
speaker_heading: BERNIE
dialog: Anna Scott?
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: BERNIE
dialog: The movie star?
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: Yup.
speaker_heading: BERNIE
dialog: Oh God. Oh God. Oh Goddy God.
text: The horror of his remembered conversation slowly unfolds.
text: Honey re-enters.
speaker_heading: HONEY
dialog: I don't believe it. I walked into the
dialog: loo with her. I was still talking when
text: she started unbuttoning her jeans...
dialog: She had to ask me to leave.
scene_heading: INT. MAX AND BELLA'S CONSERVATORY - NIGHT
text: A little later. They are sat at dinner. Bella next to Anna.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: What do you think of the guinea fowl?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: I'm a vegetarian.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: Oh God.
scene_heading: INT. MAX AND BELLA'S CONSERVATORY - NIGHT
text: Moving on through the evening -- they are very relaxed, as they
text: eat dinner. A few seconds watching the evening going well -- Anna
text: is taking this in -- real friends -- relaxed -- easy, teasing.
text: And there's a cake. Honey wears Bernie's unsuitable hat. Anna
text: watches William laughing at something and then putting his head
text: in his hands with mock shame.
scene_heading: INT. MAX AND BELLA'S CONSERVATORY - NIGHT
dialog: Coffee time.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Having you here, Anna, firmly
dialog: establishes what I've long suspected,
dialog: that we really are the most desperate
dialog: hot of under-achievers.
speaker_heading: BERNIE
dialog: Shame!
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I'm not saying it's a bad thing, in
dialog: fact, I think it's something we should
dialog: take pride in. I'm going to give the
dialog: last brownie as a prize to the saddest
dialog: act here.
text: A little pause. Then William turns to Bernie.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Bernie.
speaker_heading: BERNIE
dialog: Well, obviously it's me, isn't it --
dialog: I work in the City in a job I don't
dialog: understand and everyone keeps getting
dialog: promoted above me. I haven't had a
dialog: girlfriends since... puberty and,
dialog: well, the long and short of it is,
dialog: nobody fancies me, and if these cheeks
dialog: get any chubbier, they never will.
speaker_heading: HONEY
dialog: Nonsense. I fancy you. Or I did
dialog: before you got so far.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You see -- and unless I'm much mistaken,
dialog: your job still pays you rather a lot of
dialog: money, while Honey here, she earns
text: nothing flogging her guts out at
dialog: London's seediest record store.
speaker_heading: HONEY
dialog: Yes. And I don't have hair -- I've got
dialog: feathers, and I've got funny goggly
dialog: eyes, and I'm attracted to cruel men and
dialog: ... no one'll ever marry me because my
dialog: boosies have actually started
dialog: shrinking.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You see -- incredibly sad.
speaker_heading: BELLA
text: On the other hand, her best friend is
dialog: Anna Scott.
speaker_heading: HONEY
dialog: That's true, I can't deny it. She
dialog: needs me, what can I say?
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: And most of her limbs work. Whereas
dialog: I'm stuck in its thing day and night,
dialog: in a house full of ramps. And to add
dialog: insult to serious injury -- I've
dialog: totally given up smoking, my favourite
dialog: thing, and the truth is... we can't
dialog: have a baby.
dialog: Dead silence.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Bella.
text: Bella shrugs her shoulders. Bernie is totally grief-struck.
speaker_heading: BERNIE
dialog: No. Not true...
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: C'est la vie... We're lucky in lots
dialog: of ways, but... Surely it's worth a
dialog: brownie.
text: William reaches for her hand. Max breaks the sombre mood.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Well, I don't know. Look at
dialog: William. Very unsuccessful
dialog: professionally. Divorced. Used to
dialog: be handsome, now kind of squidgy
dialog: around the edges -- and absolutely
dialog: certain never to hear from Anna again
dialog: after she's heard that his nickname
dialog: at school was Floppy.
text: They all laugh. Anna smiles across at William.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: So I get the brownie?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I think you do, yes.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Wait a minute. What about me?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I'm sorry? You think you deserve the
dialog: brownie?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Well... a shot at it.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: You'll have to prove it. This is a
dialog: great brownie and I'm going to fight
dialog: for it. State your claim.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Well, I've been on a diet since I was
dialog: nineteen, which means basically I've
dialog: been hungry for a decade. I've had a
dialog: sequence of not nice boyfriends -- one
dialog: of whom hit me: and every time my heart
dialog: gets broken it gets splashed across
dialog: the newspapers as entertainment.
dialog: Meantime, it cost millions to get me
dialog: looking like this...
speaker_heading: HONEY
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Really -- and one day, not long from
dialog: now...
text: While she says this, quiet settles around the table. The thing
dialog: is -- she sort of means it and is opening up to them.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: ... my looks will go, they'll find out
dialog: I can't act and I'll become a sad
dialog: middle-aged woman who looks a bit like
dialog: someone who was famous for a while.
text: Silence... they all look at her... then.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Nah!!! Nice try, gorgeous -- but you
dialog: don't fool anyone.
text: The mood is instantly broken. They all laugh.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Pathetic effort to hog the brownie.
scene_heading: INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM/CORRIDOR - NIGHT
text: Anna and William are leaving.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: That was such a great evening.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I'm delighted.
text: He holds out his hand to shake. She kisses him on the cheek.
text: He stumbles back with joy.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: And may I say that's a gorgeous tie.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Now you're lying.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You're right. I told you I was bad
dialog: at acting.
dialog: Max loves this.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (to Bella)
dialog: Lovely to meet you.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: And you. I'll wait till you've gone
dialog: before I tell him you're a
dialog: vegetarian.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Night, night, Honey.
speaker_heading: HONEY
dialog: I'm so sorry about the loo thing.
dialog: I meant to leave but I just...
dialog: look, ring me if you need someone to
dialog: go shopping with. I know lots of
dialog: nice, cheap places... not that money
dialog: necessarily...
dialog: (gives up)
dialog: nice to meet you.
text: And Honey gives her a huge hug.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You too -- from now on you are my
dialog: style guru.
text: Anna and William head out... Bernie tries to save some dignity.
speaker_heading: BERNIE
dialog: Love your work.
text: They move to the door and wave goodbye.
scene_heading: EXT. MAX AND BELLA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: William and Anna step outside. From inside they hear a massive
text: and hysterical scream of the friends letting out their true
text: feelings. William is a little embarrassed.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Sorry -- they always do that when I
dialog: leave the house.
text: The house is in Lansdowne Road, on the edge of Notting Hill.
text: They walk for a moment. A bit of silence.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Floppy, huh?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: It's the hair! It's to do with the
dialog: hair.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Why is she in a wheelchair?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: It was an accident -- about eighteen
dialog: months ago.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: And the pregnancy thing -- is that to
dialog: do with the accident?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: You know, I'm not sure. I don't
dialog: think they'd tried for kids before,
dialog: as fate would have it.
text: They walk in silence for a moment. Then...
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Would you like to come... my house is
dialog: just...?
text: She smiles and shakes her head.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Too complicated.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: That's fine.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Busy tomorrow?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: I thought you were leaving.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I was.
scene_heading: EXT. NOTTING HILL GARDEN - NIGHT
text: A little later in the walk.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: What's in there?
text: They are now walking by a five foot railing, with foliage
dialog: behind it.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Gardens. All these streets round
dialog: here have these mysterious communal
text: gardens in the middle of them.
dialog: They're like little villages.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Let's go in.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Ah no -- that's the point -- they're
dialog: private villages -- only the people
dialog: who live round the edges are allowed
dialog: in.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You abide by rules like that?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Ahm...
text: Her look makes it clear that she is waiting with interest on
dialog: the answer to this.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Heck no -- other people do -- but not
dialog: me -- I just do what I want.
text: He rattles the gate, then starts his climb -- but doesn't quite
text: make it, and falls back onto the pavement...
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: (casually)
dialog: Whoopsidaisies.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: What did you say?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Yes, you did.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: No, I didn't.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You said 'whoopsidaisies.'
dialog: Tiny pause.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: I don't think so. No one has said
dialog: 'whoopsidaisies,' do they -- I mean
dialog: unless they're...
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: There's no 'unless.' No one has said
dialog: "whoopsidaisies" for fifty years and
dialog: even then it was only little girls
dialog: with blonde ringlets.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Exactly. Here we go again.
text: He fails, and unfortunately, spontaneously...
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Whoopsidaisies.
text: They look at each other.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: It's a disease I've got -- it's a
dialog: clinical thing. I'm taking pills and
dialog: having injections -- it won't last
dialog: long.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Step aside.
text: She starts to climb.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Actually be careful Anna -- it's
dialog: harder than it looks...
text: But she's already almost over.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Oh no it's not -- it's easy.
text: A few seconds later. Anna jumps down into the garden.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Come on, Flops.
text: William clambers over with terrible difficulty, dusts himself
text: off, and heads towards where she stands.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Now seriously -- what in the world
dialog: in this garden could make that
dialog: ordeal worthwhile?
text: She leans forward -- and, for the firs time since the first
text: time -- she kisses him. This time a proper kiss. A tiny pause.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Nice garden.
scene_heading: EXT. MAGIC GARDEN - NIGHT
text: They walk around the garden. It's a moonlit dream. We see
text: the lights of the houses that surround the garden. They come
text: across a single, simple wooden bench.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: 'For June, who loved this garden --
dialog: from Joseph who always sat beside
dialog: her.'
text: We cut in and see an inscription carved into the wood. She
dialog: doesn't read the dates, carved below -- 'June Wetherby, 1917
text: - 1992.' She is slightly chocked by it.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Some people do spend their whole
dialog: lives together.
text: He nods. They are standing on either side of the bench,
text: looking at each other. The camera glides away from them, up
text: into the night sky, leaving them alone in the garden. Music
dialog: plays.
scene_heading: INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING
text: William in a towel rushes downstairs, having just had a shower.
text: He shoots past Spike.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Bollocks, bollocks, bollocks. Have
dialog: you seen my glasses?
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: No, 'fraid not.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Bollocks.
dialog: (still searching --
dialog: with no help from
dialog: Spike)
dialog: This happens every time I go to the
dialog: cinema. Average day, my glasses are
dialog: everywhere -- everywhere I look,
dialog: glasses. But the moment I need them
dialog: they disappear. It's one of life's
dialog: real cruelties.
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: That's compared to, like,
dialog: earthquakes in the Far East or
dialog: testicular cancer?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Oh shit, is that the time? I have to
dialog: go.
scene_heading: INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM/CORRIDOR - EVENING
text: He sprints downstairs, now fully dressed.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: (not meaning it)
dialog: Thanks for your help on the glasses
dialog: thing.
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: (sincerely)
dialog: You're welcome. Did you find them?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Sort of.
scene_heading: INT. CINEMA - NIGHT
text: Mid-film. We move across the audience. And there is in the
text: middle of it, we see Anna, watching the screen, and next to
text: her, William, watching the film keenly, through his scuba-
text: diving goggles.
scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
dialog: A very smart Japanese restaurant. We see Anna and William
text: sitting, near the end of their meal.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: So who left who?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: She left me.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: She saw through me.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Uh-oh. That's not good.
dialog: We've been aware of the conversation at a nearby table --
text: now we can hear it. Two slightly rowdy men.
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE
dialog: No - No- No! Give me Anna Scott any
dialog: day.
text: William and Anna look at each other.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: I didn't like that last film of hers.
dialog: Fast asleep from the moment the
dialog: lights went down.
dialog: Again -- Anna reacts.
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE
dialog: Don't really care what the films are
dialog: like. Any film with her in it --
dialog: fine by me.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: No -- not my type at all really. I
dialog: prefer that other one -- blonde --
dialog: sweet looking -- has an orgasm every
dialog: time you take her out for a cup of
dialog: coffee.
dialog: Anna mouths 'Meg Ryan.'
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE
dialog: Meg Ryan.
text: William and Anna smile -- they're enjoying it.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: Drug-induced, I hear -- I believe
dialog: she's actually in rehab as we speak.
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE
dialog: Whatever, she's so clearly up for it.
text: Anna's twinkle fades.
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE
dialog: You know -- some girls, they're all
dialog: 'stay away chum' but Anna, she's
dialog: absolutely gagging for it. Do you
dialog: know that in over fifty percent of
dialog: languages the word for "actress" is
dialog: the same as the word for "prostitute."
dialog: This is horrible.
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE
dialog: And Anna is your definitive actress
dialog: -- someone really filthy you can just
dialog: flip over...
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Right, that's it.
text: He gets up and goes round the corner to the men. There are in
text: fact four of them, the two meeker men, Gavin and Harry, hanging
text: on the other guys' witty words.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: I'm sorry to disturb you guys but --
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE
dialog: Can I help you?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Well, yes, I wish I hadn't overheard
dialog: your conversation -- but I did and I
dialog: just think, you know...
dialog: He's not a very convincing or frightening figure.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: ...the person you're talking about
dialog: is a real person and I think she
dialog: probably deserves a little bit more
dialog: consideration, rather than having
dialog: jerks like you drooling over her...
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE
dialog: Oh sod off, mate. What are you, her
dialog: dad?
text: Anna suddenly appears at his side and whips him away without
dialog: being recognized.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: No, that's fine. I love that you
dialog: tried... time was I'd have done the
dialog: same.
dialog: They walk on and then...
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: In fact -- give me a second.
text: And she walks straight back to their table.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE
dialog: Oh my God...
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I'm sorry about my friend -- he's
dialog: very sensitive.
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE
dialog: No, look, I'm sorry...
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Please, please -- let's just leave
dialog: it there. I'm sure you meant no harm,
dialog: and I'm sure it was just friendly
dialog: banter and I'm sure you dicks are all
dialog: the size of peanuts. A perfect match
dialog: for the size of your brains. Enjoy
dialog: your meal. The tuna's really good.
text: And she walks away. Gerald turns to Lawrence.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: You prick.
scene_heading: EXT. RITZ ARCADE - NIGHT
text: They are walking.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I shouldn't have done that. I
dialog: shouldn't have done that.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: No, you were brilliant
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I'm rash and I'm stupid and what
dialog: am I doing with you?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: I don't know, I'm afraid.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I don't know either.
text: They have arrived at the end of the arcade.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Here we are.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Do you want to come up?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: (he hoes)
dialog: There seem to be lots of reasons
dialog: why I shouldn't.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: There are lots of reasons. Do you
dialog: want to come up?
dialog: His look says yes.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Give me five minutes.
text: He watches her go -- and stands in the street. Music plays.
scene_heading: INT. RITZ CORRIDOR/ANNA'S SUITE - NIGHT
text: William coming along the hotel corridor. He knocks on the
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Hiya.
text: There's something slightly awry. He doesn't notice.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Hi.
text: He kisses her gently on the cheek.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: To be able to do that is such a
dialog: wonderful thing.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (pause)
dialog: You've got to go.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Because my boyfriend, who I thought
dialog: was in America, is in fact in the
dialog: next room.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Your boyfriend?
text: He is duly shocked. She's trying to be calm.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Yes...
speaker_heading: JEFF (V.O.)
dialog: Who is it?
text: Jeff drifts into view behind. He is a very famous film star and
text: looks the part -- well built, very handsome. Unshaven, he has
text: magic charm, whatever he says. Over a t-shirt, he wears a
text: shirt, which he unbuttons as he talks.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Ahm... room service.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: How you doing? I thought you guys
dialog: all wore those penguin coats.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Well, yes -- usually -- I'd just
dialog: changed to go home -- but I thought
dialog: I'd just deal with this final call.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Oh great. Could you do me a favour
dialog: and try to get us some really cold
dialog: water up here?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: I'll see what I can do.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Still, not sparkling.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Absolutely. Ice cold still water.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Unless it's illegal in the UK to
dialog: serve liquids below room temperature:
dialog: I don't want you going to jail just
dialog: to satisfy my whims...
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: No, I'm sure it'll be fine.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: And maybe you could just adios the
text: dishes and empty the trash.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Right.
text: And he does just that. Scoops up the two used plates and heads
dialog: to the bin.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Really -- don't do that -- I'm sure
dialog: this is not his job.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I'm sorry. Is this a problem?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Ah -- no. It's fine.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: What's your name?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Ahm... Bernie.
text: Jeff slips him a fiver.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Thank you, Bernie.
dialog: (to Anna)
dialog: Hey -- nice surprise, or nasty
dialog: surprise?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Nice surprise.
text: He kisses her.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Liar.
dialog: (to William)
dialog: She hates surprises. What are you
dialog: ordering?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I haven't decided.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Well, don't over-do it. I don't want
dialog: people saying, 'There goes that
dialog: famous actor with the big, fat
dialog: girlfriend."
text: He wanders off taking off his t-shirt.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: I better leave.
text: Anna just nods.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: -- this is a fairly strange reality
dialog: to be faced with. To be honest, I
dialog: don't realize...
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I'm sorry... I don't know what to
dialog: say.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: I think goodbye is traditional.
scene_heading: INT. RITZ CORRIDOR - NIGHT
text: William walks away.
scene_heading: EXT. RITZ - NIGHT
text: William walks down the arcade outside the hotel. He is
dialog: stunned.
scene_heading: EXT. LONDON BUS - NIGHT
text: William sits alone on a bus. We see him through the side
text: window. As it drives away, we see that the whole back of the
text: bus is taken up with a huge picture of Anna.
scene_heading: INT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: He gets into his room and sits on the bed.
scene_heading: INT. SPACESHIP - NIGHT
text: Space Anna, in the very hi-tech environment and a serious
text: moods, fastens the last clasps on her uniform. She takes a
text: helmet type thing, and places it on her head.
scene_heading: INT. CONNECT CINEMA - NIGHT
text: Cut round to the Coronet cinema where this film is showing.
text: It's not full. The camera moves and finds, sitting on his
text: own...William. Just watching. We see a momentous flash of
text: light from the screen explode, reflected in his eye.
scene_heading: INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING
text: William is looking out the window, lost in thought. Spike
dialog: enters.
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: Come on -- open up -- this is me --
dialog: Spikey -- I'm in contact with some
dialog: quite important spiritual vibrations.
dialog: What's wrong?
text: Spike settles on the arm of a chair. William decides to open
dialog: up a bit...
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Well, okay. There's this girl...
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: Aha! I'd been getting a female vibe.
dialog: Good. Speak on, dear friend.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: She's someone I just can't -- someone
dialog: who... self-evidently can't be mine --
dialog: and it's as if I've taken love-heroin
dialog: -- and now I can't even have it again.
dialog: I've opened Pandora's box. And there's
dialog: trouble inside.
text: Spike nods thoughtfully.
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: Yeh. Yeh... tricky... tricky... I
dialog: knew a girl at school called Pandora
dialog: ... never got to see her box though.
text: He roars with laughter. William smiles.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Thanks. Yes -- very helpful.
scene_heading: INT. TONY'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT
text: Only two tables are being used. William and his friends are
text: on their first course. Bernie reads an "Evening Standard,"
text: with a picture of Anna and Jeff at Heathrow Airport.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You didn't know she had a boyfriend?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: No -- did you?
dialog: Their looks make it obvious that everyone did.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Bloody hell, I can't believe it --
dialog: my whole life ruined because I don't
dialog: read 'Hello' magazine.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Let's face facts. This was always a
dialog: no-go situation. Anna's a goddess
dialog: and you know what happens to mortals
dialog: who get involved with the gods.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Buggered?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Every time. But don't despair -- I
dialog: think I have the solution to your
dialog: problems.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Really?
text: They all look to him for wise words.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Her name is Tessa and she works in
dialog: the contracts department. The hair,
dialog: I admit, is unfashionable frizzy --
text: but she's as bright as a button and
text: kisses like a nymphomaniac on death
dialog: row. Apparently.
scene_heading: INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: The kitchen. William is looking uneasy. A doorbell rings.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Now -- try.
text: William nods. Max heads off to the door. We stay with William
text: -- and just hear the door open and a voice come down the
dialog: corridor.
speaker_heading: TESSA (V.O.)
dialog: I got completely lost -- it's real
dialog: difficult, isn't it? Everything's
dialog: got the word 'Kensington' in it --
dialog: Kensington Park Road, Kensington
dialog: Gardens, Kensington bloody Park
dialog: Gardens...
text: They reach the kitchen. Tessa is a lush girl with huge hair.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Tessa -- this is Bella my wife.
speaker_heading: TESSA
dialog: Oh hello, you're in a wheelchair.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: And this is William.
speaker_heading: TESSA
dialog: Hello William. Max has told me
dialog: everything about you.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: (frightened)
dialog: Has he?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Wine?
speaker_heading: TESSA
dialog: Oh yes please. Come on, Willie, let's
dialog: get sloshed.
text: She turns to take the wine and William has a split second to send
text: a message of panic to Bella. She agrees -- it's bad.
scene_heading: INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/CONSERVATORY - NIGHT
text: Max walks over to the table. Honey, Bella, William and another
dialog: girl.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Keziah -- some woodcock?
speaker_heading: KEZIAH
dialog: No, thank you -- I'm a fruitarian.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I don't realize that.
text: It is left to William, who has been set up here, to fill the
dialog: pause.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: And ahm -- what's a fruitarian exactly?
speaker_heading: KEZIAH
dialog: We believe that fruits and vegetables
dialog: have feelings so we think cooking is
dialog: cruel. We only eat things that have
dialog: actually fallen from the tree or bush
dialog: -- that are, in fact, dead already.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Right. Right. Interesting stuff.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: So these carrots...
speaker_heading: KEZIAH
dialog: Have been murdered, yes.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Murdered? Poor carrots. How beastly.
scene_heading: INT. MAX AND BELLA'S CONSERVATORY - NIGHT
text: Time for coffee and chocolates. Beside William sits the final,
text: perfect girl. She is Rosie, quite young, smartly dressed,
text: open-hearted. It is just Max and William and Bella and her.
speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: Delicious coffee.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Thank you. I'm sorry about the lamb.
speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: No -- I thought it was really, you know,
dialog: interesting.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Interesting means inedible.
speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: Really inedible -- yes that's right.
dialog: They all laugh. It's going very well.
scene_heading: INT. MAX AND BELLA'S CORRIDOR - NIGHT
text: William is with Rosie by the door -- just about to say goodbye.
speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: Maybe we'll meet again some time.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Yes. That would be... great.
text: She kisses him gently on the cheek. He opens the door -- she
text: walks out. He shuts the door quietly and heads back into the
dialog: living room...
scene_heading: INT. MAX AND BELLA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Max and Bella wait excitedly.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Well?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: She's perfect, perfect.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: And?
text: William makes a gentle, exasperated gesture, then...
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: I think you have forgotten...
dialog: (he looks at them)
dialog: what an unusual situation you have
dialog: here -- to find someone you actually
dialog: love, who'll love you -- the chances
dialog: are... always miniscule. Look at me
dialog: -- not counting the American -- I've
dialog: only loved two girls in my whole life,
dialog: both total disasters.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: That's not fair.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: No really, one of them marries me and
dialog: then leaves me quicker than you can
dialog: say Indiana Jones -- and the other,
dialog: who seriously ought to have known
dialog: better, casually marries my best
dialog: friend.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Still loves you though.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
text: In a depressingly asexual way.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I never fancied you much actually...
text: They all roar with laughter.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: I mean I loved you -- you were terribly
dialog: funny. But all that kissing my ears...
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Oh no -- this is just getting worse.
dialog: I am going to find myself, 30 years
dialog: from now, still on this couch.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: Do you want to stay?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Why not -- all that awaits me at home
text: is a masturbating Welshman.
text: Music starts to play to take us through these silent scenes.
scene_heading: INT. MAX AND BELLA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Max lifts Bella off her couch and carries her upstairs.
text: Mix through -- William sits on the couch downstairs -- eyes wide
dialog: open -- thinking.
scene_heading: INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Morning. Max, all in his suit for the city... Bella kisses him
text: goodbye. William sees this from the kitchen. She is also
text: dressed for work -- and moves back into the kitchen to pack her
text: briefcase with law books from the kitchen table.
scene_heading: EXT. MAX AND BELLA'S HOUSE - DAY
text: William emerges from the house, a little ruffled from a night
text: away from home, a heads off.
scene_heading: EXT. NEWSAGENT - DAY
text: William walks past the newsagent, heading for home. We see,
text: though he doesn't, a rack of tabloid papers, all of which seem
dialog: to have very grainy, grabbed pictures of Anna on their front
dialog: page. Headlines --'Anna Stunna'-- 'It's Definitely Her!'
dialog: and 'Scott of Pantartica.'
scene_heading: INT. WILLIAM'S BATHROOM - DAY
text: William is shaving. The bell goes. He heads out to answer it.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. WILLIAM'S HOUSE -DAY
text: William arrives at the door and opens it. There stands a dark-
dialog: glassed Anna.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Hi. Can I come in?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Come in.
text: She moves inside. Her hair is a mess -- her eyes are tired.
dialog: Nothing idealized.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: The two of them.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: They were taken years ago -- I know
dialog: it was... well, I was poor and it
dialog: happens a lot -- that's not an excuse
dialog: -- but to make things worse, it now
dialog: appears someone was filming me as
dialog: well. So what was a stupid photo-
text: shoot now looks like a porno film.
dialog: And well... the pictures have been
dialog: solid and they're everywhere.
text: William shakes his head.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I don't know where to go. The hotel
text: is surrounded.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: This is the place.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Thank you. I'm just in London for two
dialog: days -- but, with your papers, it's the
dialog: worse place to be.
text: She's very shaken.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: These are such horrible pictures.
dialog: They're so grainy... they make me
dialog: look like...
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Don't think about it. We'll sort it
dialog: out. Now what would you like -- tea
dialog: ... bath...?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: A bath would be great.
scene_heading: INT. WILLIAM'S CORRIDOR - DAY
text: Spike enters through the front door. William doesn't hear him.
text: Spike is reading newspapers with the Anna pictures in it.
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: Christ alive... brilliant... fantastic
dialog: .... magnificent...
text: He heads up the stairs. Opens the bathroom door, walks in.
scene_heading: INT. WILLIAM'S BATHROOM - DAY
text: Spike heads for the toilet -- undoes his zip...
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You must be Spike.
text: She's in the bath. Spike turns in shock -- and sidles out of the
dialog: bathroom.
scene_heading: INT. WILLIAM'S CORRIDOR - DAY
text: Spike calms himself down. He then opens the bathroom door
text: again -- and looks in.
scene_heading: INT. WILLIAM'S BATHROOM - DAY
text: Anna is still lying low in the bath.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: Just checking.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
text: Spike comes back out into the corridor. Looks to heaven.
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: Thank you, God.
scene_heading: INT. WILLIAM'S KITCHEN - DAY
text: William and Anna at the kitchen table, eating toast, dringking
dialog: tea.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I'm really sorry about last time. He
dialog: just flew in -- I had no idea -- in fact,
dialog: I had no idea if he'd ever fly in again.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: No, that's fine. It's not often one
dialog: has the opportunity to adios the plates
dialog: of a major Hollywood star. It was a
dialog: thrill for me.
dialog: (she smiles. Pause)
dialog: How is he?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I don't know. It got to the point where
dialog: I couldn't remember any of the reasons
dialog: I loved him. And you... and love?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Well, there's a question -- without
dialog: an interesting answer.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I have thought about you.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Oh no no -- no.
dialog: He doesn't think she has to talk about this.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Just anytime I've tried to keep
dialog: things normal with anyone normal --
dialog: it's been a disaster.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: I appreciate that absolutely.
dialog: (changing subject
dialog: tactfully)
dialog: Is that the film you're doing?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Yes -- start in L.A. on Tuesday.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Would you like me to take you through
dialog: your lines?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Would you? It's all talk, talk, talk.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Hand it over. Basic plot?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I'm a difficult but brilliant junior
dialog: officer who in about twenty minutes
dialog: will save the world from nuclear
dialog: disaster.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Well done you.
scene_heading: EXT. TERRACE - DAY
text: A little later. They're in the thick of the script.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: 'Message from command. Would you like
dialog: them to send in the HKs?'
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: 'No, turn over 4 TRS's and tell them we
dialog: need radar feedback before the KFT's
dialog: return at 19 hundred -- then inform the
dialog: Pentagon that we'll be needing black
dialog: star cover from ten hundred through
dialog: 12.15' -- and don't you dare say one
dialog: word about how many mistakes I made in
dialog: that speech or I'll pelt you with
dialog: olives.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: 'Very well, captain -- I'll pass that
dialog: on straightaway.'
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: 'Thank you.' How many mistake did I
dialog: make?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Eleven.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Damn. 'And Wainwright...'
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Cartwright.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: 'Cartwright, Wainwright, whatever
dialog: your name is, I promised little Jimmy
dialog: I'd be home for his birthday -- could
dialog: you get a message through that I may
dialog: be a little late.'
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: 'Certainly. And little Johnny?'
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: My son's name is Johnny?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Yup.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Well, get a message through to him
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Brilliant.
dialog: (the scene's over)
dialog: Word perfect I'd say.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Gripping. It's not Jane Austen, it's
dialog: not Henry James, but it's gripping.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You think I should do Henry James
dialog: instead?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: I'm sure you'd be great in Henry James.
dialog: But, you know -- this writer's pretty
dialog: damn good too.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Yes -- I mean -- you never get anyone
dialog: in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve
dialog: to say 'inform the Pentagon that we
dialog: need black star cover.'
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: And I think the book is the poorer for
dialog: it.
text: Anna smiles her biggest smile of the day. He is helping.
scene_heading: INT. WILLIAM'S DINING ROOM
text: Anna and William. Sat down at table. There's a picture
text: hanging on the wall behind.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I can't believe you have that picture
dialog: on your wall.
text: It is a poster of a Chagall painting of a floating wedding couple,
dialog: with a goat as company.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: You like Chagall?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I do. It feels like how being in love
text: should be. Floating through a dark
dialog: blue sky.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
text: With a goat playing a violin.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Yes -- happiness wouldn't be happiness
text: without a violin-playing goat.
text: Spike enters with three pizzas.
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: Voila. Carnival Calypso, for the
dialog: Queen of Notting Hill -- pepperoni,
dialog: pineapple and a little more
dialog: pepperoni.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Fantastic.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: I don't mention that Anna's a
dialog: vegetarian, did I?
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I have some parsnip stew from last week.
dialog: If I just peel the skin off, it'll be
dialog: perfect.
scene_heading: INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Later in the evening. William and Anna on their own. They're
text: sipping coffee. A few seconds of just co-existing. Anna looks
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You've got big feet.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Yes. Always have had.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You know what they say about men with
dialog: big feet?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: No. What's that?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Big feet -- large shoes.
text: He laughs.
scene_heading: INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: A few hours later -- eating ice-cream out of the tub.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: The thing that's so irritating is that
dialog: now I'm so totally fierce when it comes
dialog: to nudity clauses.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: You actually have clauses in your
dialog: contact about nudity?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Definitely. 'You may show the dent at
text: the top of the artist's buttocks -- but
dialog: neither cheek. In the event of a stunt
dialog: person being used, the artist must have
dialog: full consultation.'
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: You have a stunt bottom?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I could have a stunt bottom, yes.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Would you be tempted to go for a
dialog: slightly better bottom than your own?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Definitely. Ths is important stuff.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: It's one hell of a job. What do you put
dialog: on your passport? Profession -- Mel
dialog: Gibson's bottom.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Actually, Mel does his own ass work.
dialog: Why wouldn't he? It's delicious.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: The ice cream or Mel Gibson's bottom?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Both.
scene_heading: INT. WILLIAM'S UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - NIGHT
text: They are walking up the stairs -- and stop at the top.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Today has ben a good day. Which under
dialog: the circumstances is... unexpected.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Well, thank you.
dialog: (awkward pause)
dialog: Anyway -- time for bed. Or...
dialog: sofa-bed.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Right.
text: Pause. She leans forward, kisses him gently, then steps into
text: the bedroom and closes the door.
scene_heading: INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: William downstairs -- on a sofa -- under a duvet. Eyes open.
text: Thinking. Pause and pause.
dialog: He waits and waits -- the ultimate 'yearn.' But nothing
text: happens. William gets off the sofa decisively. Sits on the
text: side of it. Then gets back in again.
text: Pause, pause, then... in the darkness, a stair creaks. There's
dialog: someone there.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Oh my God...
dialog: (then...)
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: Hello. I wonder if I could have a
dialog: little word.
text: He drifts round the corner, half-naked.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Spike.
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: I don't want to interfere, or anything
dialog: ... but she's split up from her boy-
dialog: friend, that's right isn't it?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Maybe.
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: And she's in your house.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: And you get on very well.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: Well, isn't this perhaps a good
dialog: opportunity to... slip her one?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Spike. For God's sake -- she's in
dialog: trouble -- get a grip.
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: Right. Right. You think it's the
dialog: wrong moment. Fair enough.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Do you mind if I have a go?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Spike!
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: No -- you're right.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: I'll talk to you in the morning.
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: Okay -- okay. Might be too late, but
dialog: okay.
text: Back to William thinking again. Dreamy atmosphere. And then...
text: more footsteps on the stairs.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Oh please sod off.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: No! No. Wait. I... thought you were
dialog: someone else. I thought you were Spike.
dialog: I'm delighted you're not.
text: The darkness of the living room. We see Anna in the shadow.
scene_heading: INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: A few moments later. William and Anna stand in the middle of
text: the room. He kisses her neck. Then her shoulder. What a
dialog: miracle it is just to be able to touch this girl's skin. Then
text: he looks at her face. That face. He is suddenly struck by who
dialog: it is.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Wow.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: What?
text: And then gets over it straight away.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Nothing.
text: And kisses her.
scene_heading: INT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: The middle of the night. They are both asleep -- a yard apart.
text: In sleep, her arm reaches out, touches his shoulder and then
text: she wriggles across and re-settles herself, tenderly, right
text: next to him. He is not asleep and knows how extraordinary this
dialog: all is.
scene_heading: INT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM - DAY
dialog: The morning.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: It still strikes me as, well, surreal,
dialog: that I'm allowed to see you naked.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You and every person in this country.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Oh God yes -- I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: What is it about men and nudity?
dialog: Particularly breasts -- how can you be so
dialog: interested in them?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Well...
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: No seriously. I mean, they're just
dialog: breasts. Every second person in the
dialog: world has got them...
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: More than that actually, when you think
dialog: about it. You know, Meatloaf has a very
dialog: nice pair...
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: But... they're odd-looking. They're
dialog: for milk. Your mum's got them. You
dialog: must have seen a thousand of them --
dialog: what's the fuss about?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Actually, I can't think really -- let
dialog: me just have a quick look...
text: He looks under the sheet at her breasts.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: No, beats me.
dialog: She laughs...
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Rita Hayworth used to say -- 'they go to
dialog: bed with Gilda -- they wake up with me.'
dialog: Do you feel that?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Who was Gilda?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Her most famous part -- men went to bed
dialog: with the dream -- and they didn't like
dialog: it when they woke up with the reality --
dialog: do you feel that way with me?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: (pause)
dialog: You're lovelier this morning than you
dialog: have ever been.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (very touched)
dialog: Oh.
text: She looks at him carefully. Then leaps out of bed.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I'll be back.
scene_heading: INT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM - MORNING
text: William on the bed. The door opens. It is Anna with a tray of
dialog: toast and tea.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Breakfast in bed. Or lunch, or brunch.
text: She heads across. She smiles and sits on the bed.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Can I stay a bit longer?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Stay forever.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Damn, I forgot the jam.
text: The doorbell goes.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You get the door, I'll get the jam.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. WILLIAM'S CORRIDOR - DAY
text: William heads down the corridor and opens the door. Outside
text: are hundreds of paparazzi -- an explosion of cameras and
text: questions, of noise and light. The press seem to fill the
dialog: entire street.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Jesus Christ.
text: He comes back inside, snapping the door behind him. Anna is in
dialog: the kitchen.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Don't ask.
text: She heads back the corridor, with no suspicion.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You're up to something...
text: She thinks he's fooling around. She opens the door, the same
text: explosion. In a split second she's inside.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Oh my God. And they got a photo of you
dialog: dressed like that?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Undressed like this, yes.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Jesus.
scene_heading: INT. WILLIAM'S KITCHEN - DAY
text: Anna is on the phone. Spike is blithely heading downstairs to
text: the kitchen in just his underpants.
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: Morning, daring ones.
text: He does a thumbs up to William -- very excited about what he knows
dialog: was a 'result.'
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (on the phone)
dialog: It's Anna. The press are here. No,
dialog: there are hundreds of them. My
dialog: brilliant plan was not so brilliant
dialog: after all. Yeh, I know, I know. Just
dialog: get me out then.
dialog: (she hangs up)
dialog: Damnit.
text: She heads upstairs.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: I wouldn't go outside.
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Just take my work for it.
text: The moment William goes upstairs, Spike heads for the front
dialog: door.
scene_heading: EXT. WILLIAM'S HOUSE - DAY
text: From outside -- we see this scrawny bloke in the frame of the
text: doorway, in his grey underpants. A thousand photos. Spike
dialog: poses athletically.
scene_heading: INT. WILLIAM'S CORRIDOR - DAY
text: Spike closes the door and wanders along to a mirror in the hall-
text: way, muttering.
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: How did I look?
dialog: Inspects himself.
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: Not bad. No bad at all. Well-chosen
dialog: briefs, I'd say. Chicks love grey.
dialog: Mmmmm. Nice firm buttocks.
scene_heading: INT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM - DAY
text: William enters. He's unhappy for her. She's almost dressed.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: How are you doing?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: How do you think I'm doing?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: I don't know what happened.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I do. Your furry friend thought he'd
dialog: make a buck or two telling the papers
dialog: where I was.
text: She's packing.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: That's not true.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Really? The entire British press just
dialog: woke up this morning and thought 'Hey --
dialog: I know where Anna Scott is. She's in
dialog: that house with the blue door in Notting
dialog: Hill.' And then you go out in your
dialog: goddamn underwear.
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: (dropping in)
dialog: I went out in my goddamn underwear too.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Get out, Spike.
dialog: (he does)
dialog: I'm so sorry.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: This is such a mess. I come to you to
dialog: protect myself against more crappy
dialog: gossip and now I'm landed in it all
dialog: over again. For God's sake, I've got
dialog: a boyfriend.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: You do?
text: It's a difficult moment -- defining where they stand.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: As far as they're concerned I do. And
dialog: now tomorrow there'll be pictures of
dialog: you in every newspapers from here to
dialog: Timbuktu.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: I know, I know -- but... just -- let's
dialog: stay calm...
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You can stay calm -- it's the perfect
dialog: situation for you -- minimum input,
dialog: maximum publicity. Everyone you ever
dialog: bump into will know. 'Well done you --
dialog: you slept with that actress -- we've
dialog: seen the pictures.'
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: That's spectacularly unfair.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Who knows, it may even help business.
dialog: Buy a boring book about Egypt from the
dialog: guy who screwed Anna Scott.
text: She heads out.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRS/LIVING ROOM - DAY
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Now stop. Stop. I beg you -- calm down.
dialog: Have a cup of tea.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I don't want a goddamn cup of tea. I
dialog: want to go home.
text: The doorbell goes.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Spike, check who that is... and for
dialog: God's sake put some clothes on.
text: Spike leans merrily out of the window.
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: Looks like a chauffeur to me.
scene_heading: INT. WILLIAM'S KITCHEN/CORRIDOR - DAY
text: They move from the kitchen into the corridor.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: And remember -- Spike owes you an
dialog: expensive dinner. Or holiday --
dialog: depending if he's got the brains to get
dialog: the going rate on betrayal.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: That's not true. And wait a minute...
dialog: this is crazy behavior. Can't we just
dialog: laugh about this? Seriously -- in the
dialog: huge sweep of things, this stuff
dialog: doesn't matter.
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: What he's going to say next is -- there
dialog: are people starving in the Sudan.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Well, there are. And we don't need to
dialog: go anywhere near that far. My best
dialog: friend slipped -- she slipped down-
text: stairs, cracked her back and she's in a
dialog: wheelchair for the rest of her life.
dialog: All I'm asking for is a normal amount
dialog: of perspective.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You're right: of course, you're right.
dialog: It's just that I've dealt with this
dialog: garbage for ten years now -- you've had
dialog: it for ten minutes. Our perspectives
dialog: are different.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: I mean -- today's newspapers will be
text: lining tomorrow's waste paper bins.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Well, you know -- it's just one day.
dialog: Today's papers will all have been
dialog: thrown away tomorrow.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You really don't get it. This story
dialog: gets filed. Every time anyone writes
dialog: anything about me -- they'll dig up
dialog: these photos. Newspapers last forever.
dialog: I'll regret this forever.
dialog: He takes this in. That's the end.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Right. Fine. I will do the opposite,
dialog: if it's all right by you -- and always be
dialog: glad you came. But you're right -- you
dialog: probably better go.
text: She looks at him. The doorbell goes again. She opens the door.
text: Massive noise and photos. Outside are her people, including
text: Karen, a chauffeur, two bodyguards. And then the door is shut
dialog: and they're all gone. Silence.
scene_heading: INT. WILLIAM'S KITCHEN/CORRIDOR - DAY
text: Spike and William sitting there. Pause.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Was it you?
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: I suppose I might have told one or two
dialog: people down the pub.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Right.
text: He puts his head in his hands. It's over now.
scene_heading: EXT. LONDON - DAY
text: As full, sad music plays -- William begins to walk through
dialog: Notting Hill.
dialog: This walk takes six months... as he walks, the seasons actually
dialog: and magically change, from summer, through autumn and winter,
dialog: back into spring...
dialog: First it is summer -- summer fruits and flowers -- a six-month
text: pregnant woman -- Honey with another leather-jacket boyfriend.
text: As he walks on the rain starts to fall -- he turns up his coat
text: collar -- umbrellas appear. Followed by winter coats --
text: chestnuts roasting -- Christmas trees on sale and the first hint
dialog: of snow.
text: Then he comes to Blenheim Crescent, which is startling snowscape,
text: for the hundred yard, right across Ladbroke Grove.
text: By the time he reaches the purple cafe, the snow is melting and
text: in a few yards, it is spring again. He passes Honey again --
text: arguing with her boyfriend, walking away tearful. Then turns
text: past 'the pregnant woman' -- now holding her three-month baby.
text: The camera holds on her.
scene_heading: INT. BOOKSHOP - DAY
text: A grey day in the bookshop. Martin and William. As ever. A
dialog: feeling that things in there ever change.
text: Ten seconds pass. Honey rushes in. Spike, still feeling in
text: disgrace, comes in with her but lingers in the doorway.
speaker_heading: HONEY
dialog: Have we got something for you.
dialog: Something which will make you love me so
dialog: much you'll want to hug me every single
dialog: day for the rest of my life.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Blimey. What's that?
speaker_heading: HONEY
dialog: The phone number of Anna Scott's agent
dialog: in London and her agent in New York.
dialog: You can ring her. You think about her
dialog: all the time -- now you can ring her!
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Well, thanks, that's great.
speaker_heading: HONEY
dialog: It is great, isn't it. See you tonight.
dialog: Hey, Marty-- sexy cardy.
text: And she rushes out. William looks at the piece of paper, folds
text: it and then places it gently in the garbage bin.
scene_heading: INT. TONY'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT
text: Bella bangs a spoon on a wine bottle. All the friends are
dialog: gathered in the restaurant.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: I have a little speech to make -- I won't
dialog: stand up because I can't... be bothered.
dialog: Exactly a year ago today, this man here
dialog: started the finest restaurant in London.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Thank you very much.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: Unfortunately -- no one ever came to eat
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: TONY
text: A tiny hiccough.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: And so we must face the fact that from
dialog: next week, we have to find somewhere
dialog: near to eat.
text: Tony's brave face breaks. The dream is over.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: I just want to say to Tony -- don't take
dialog: it personally. The more I think about
dialog: things, the more I see no rhyme or reason
dialog: in life -- no one knows why some things
dialog: work out, and some things don't -- why
dialog: some of us get lucky -- and some of us...
speaker_heading: BERNIE
dialog: ... get fired.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: BERNIE
dialog: Yes, they're shifting the whole outfit
dialog: much more towards the trading side --
dialog: and of course...
dialog: (he owns up)
dialog: I was total crap.
text: They're all rather stunned.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: So we go down together! A toast to
dialog: Bernie -- the worst stockbroker in the
dialog: whole world!
text: They toast him.
speaker_heading: HONEY
dialog: Since it's an evening of announcements
dialog: ... I've also got one, Ahm... I've
dialog: decided to get engaged.
text: Total bewilderment from the others.
speaker_heading: HONEY
dialog: I've found myself a nice, slightly odd
dialog: looking bloke who I know is going to
dialog: make me happy for the rest of my life.
dialog: Special cut to Bernie -- the shot shows he had special feelings
dialog: for Honey.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Wait a minute -- I'm your brother and I
dialog: don't know anything about this.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Is it someone we know?
speaker_heading: HONEY
dialog: Yes. I will keep you informed.
text: As she sits down, Honey leans towards Spike and whispers.
speaker_heading: HONEY
dialog: By the way -- it's you.
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: Me?
speaker_heading: HONEY
dialog: Yes. What do you think?
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: Well, yes. Groovy.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Any more announcements?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Yes -- I feel I must apologize to
dialog: everyone for my behavior for the last
dialog: six months. I have, as you know, been
text: slightly down in the mouth.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: There's an understatement. There are
dialog: dead people on better form.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: But I wish to make it clear I've turned
dialog: a corner and henceforward intend to be
text: impressively happy.
scene_heading: INT. TONY'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT
dialog: Two hours later. They've had a very good time. There's been a
text: chocolate cake. Lots of alcohol. Tony is playing 'Blue Moon'
text: on the piano, and Bernie joins him, singing.
text: At one table Bella and Honey sit -- beer and wine on the table.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: I'm really horribly drunk.
text: Elsewhere, Max an William are relaxed together.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: So -- you've laid the ghost.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: I believe I have.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Don't give a damn about the famous girl.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: No, don't think I do.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Which means you won't be distracted by
dialog: the fact that she's back in London,
dialog: grasping her Oscar, and to be found
text: filming most days on Hampstead Heath.
text: He puts down a copy of the 'Evening Standard' with a picture of
text: Anna on its cover.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: (immediate gloom)
dialog: Oh God no.
speaker_heading: MAX
text: So not over her, in fact.
scene_heading: EXT. HAMPSTEAD HEATH - DAY
text: Cut to the wide sweep of Hampstead Heath. William entirely
text: alone. He marches up a hill... goes over the crest of it -- and
text: sees a huge film crew and hundreds of extras in front of the
text: radiant white of Kenwood House, with its lawn and its lakes.
scene_heading: EXT. KENWOOD HOUSE - DAY
text: Now closer to the house, William approaches a barrier -- where
text: he is himself approached.
speaker_heading: SECURITY
dialog: Can I help you?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...
speaker_heading: SECURITY
dialog: Does she know you're coming?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: No, no. She doesn't.
speaker_heading: SECURITY
dialog: I'm afraid I can't really let you
dialog: through then, sir.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Oh right. I mean, I am a friend -- I'm
dialog: not a lunatic but -- no, you basically...
speaker_heading: SECURITY
dialog: ... can't let you through.
text: At that moment -- thirty yards away, William sees trailer door
text: open. Out of it comes Anna -- looking extraordinary -- in a
text: velvet dress; full, beautiful make-up; rich, extravagant hair.
text: She has a necessary cluster of people about her. Hair, make-up,
text: costume and the third assistant who has collected her.
text: She walks a few yards, and then casually turns her head. And
text: sees him. Her face registers not jut surprise, certainly not a
dialog: simple smile. His being there is a complicated thing.
text: Cut back to him. He does a small wave. She pauses as the whole
text: paraphernalia of the upcoming scene passes between them. The
text: movie divides them. But then she begins to walk through it, and
text: followed by her cluster, she makes her way towards him. When
text: she reaches him, the security guard stands back a pace, and her
text: people hold back. She doesn't really know what to say...
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: This is certainly... ah...
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: I only found out you were here
dialog: yesterday.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I was going to ring... but... I didn't
dialog: think you'd want to...
text: The third assistant is under pressure.
speaker_heading: THIRD
dialog: Anna.
text: She looks around. The poor third is nervous -- and the first is
dialog: approaching.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (to William)
dialog: It's not going very well -- and it's
dialog: our last day.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Absolutely -- you're clearly very busy.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: But... wait... there are things to say.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Drink tea -- there's lots of tea.
text: She is swept away, four people touching her hair and costume.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Come and have a look...
scene_heading: EXT. KENWOOD PARK - DAY
text: As they make towards the set...
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Are you a fan of Henry James?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: This is Henry James film?
scene_heading: EXT. KENWOOD HOUSE - DAY
text: A complicated shot is about to happen -- with waves of extras --
text: and a huge moving crane. They end up next to the sound desk.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: This is Harry -- he'll give you a pair of
dialog: headphones so you can hear the dialogue.
text: Harry the sound man is a pleasant, fifty-year-old balding
text: fellow. He hands him the headphones.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Here we go. The volume control is on
dialog: the side.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: That's great.
text: William, the headphones on, surveys the scene -- the cluster is
text: a full 100 yards from the action, to allow a gracious sweeping
text: wide-shot. He watches Anna. She is with her co-star in the
dialog: Henry James film -- let's call him James.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: We are living in cloudcuckooland --
dialog: we'll never get this done today.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: We have to. I've got to be in New York
dialog: on Thursday.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Oh, stop showing off.
text: He studies an actress a few yards to the left.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: God, that's an enormous arse.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I'm not listening.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: No, but seriously -- it's not fair -- so
dialog: many tragic young teenagers with
dialog: anorexia -- and that girl has an arse
dialog: she could perfectly well share round
dialog: with at least ten other women -- and
text: still be beg-bottomed.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I said I'm not listening -- and I think,
dialog: looking at something that firm, you and
dialog: your droopy little excuse for an 'arse'
dialog: would be well-advised to keep quiet.
text: Back by the desk, William is listening and laughs. That's his
text: girl. Anna prepares.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: So I ask you when you're going to tell
dialog: everyone, and you say...?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: 'Tomorrow will be soon enough.'
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: And then I... right.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Who was that rather difficult chap you
dialog: were talking to on the way up?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Oh... no one... no one. Just some...
dialog: guy from the past. I don't know what
dialog: he's doing here. Bit of an awkward
dialog: situation.
scene_heading: EXT. HAMPSTEAD HEATH - DAY
dialog: Cut back to William -- he has heard.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Of course.
text: He takes off the headphones and puts them gently down.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Anytime.
text: William walks away. The moment of hope is gone. He couldn't
dialog: have had a clear reminder.
scene_heading: INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING
text: William is emptying Anna Scott videos into a box.
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: What's going on?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: I'm going to throw out these old videos.
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: No. You can't bin these. They're
dialog: classics. I'm not allowing this.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Right -- let's talk about rent...
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: Let me help. We don't want all this
dialog: shit cluttering up our lives.
scene_heading: INT. BACKROOM OF THE BOOKSHOP - DAY
text: The next day. William is hard at work, doing the accounts in a
text: dark small room with files in it. Martin pops his head in.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: I have to disturb you when you're
dialog: cooking the books, but there's a
dialog: delivery.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Martin, can't you just deal with this
dialog: yourself?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: But it's not for the shop. It's for you.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Okay. Tell me, would I have to pay a wet
dialog: rag as much as I pay you?
text: They head out, Martin behind him, incomprehensively rubbing
text: his hands -- he's in a very good mood.
scene_heading: INT. BOOKSHOP - DAY
text: William enters -- and there stands Anna -- in a simple blue
dialog: skirt and top.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You disappeared.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I
dialog: didn't want to disturb you.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Well... how have you been?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Fine. Everything much the same. When
dialog: they change the law Spike and I will
dialog: marry immediately. Whereas you...
dialog: I've watched in wonder. Awards, glory
dialog: ...
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Oh no. It's all nonsense, believe me.
dialog: I had no idea how much nonsense it all
dialog: was -- but nonsense it all is...
dialog: (she's nervous)
dialog: Well, yesterday was our last day
dialog: filming and so I'm just off -- but I
dialog: brought you this from home, and...
text: It's quite a big wrapped parcel, flat -- 3 foot by 4 foot,
text: leaning against a bookshelf.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I thought I'd give it to you.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Thank you. Shall I...
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: No, don't open it yet -- I'll be
dialog: embarrassed.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Okay -- well, thank you. I don't know
dialog: what it's for. But thank you anyway.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I actually had it in my apartment in New
dialog: York and just thought you'd... but,
dialog: when it came to it, I didn't know how to
dialog: call you... having behaved so... badly,
dialog: twice. So it's been just sitting in the
dialog: hotel. But then... you came, so I
dialog: figured... the thing is... the thing is
dialog: ...
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: What's the thing?
text: Then the door pings. In walks the annoying customer, Mr. Smith.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Don't even think about it. Go away
dialog: immediately.
text: Mr. Smith is taken aback and therefore completely obedient.
speaker_heading: MR. SMITH
dialog: Right. Sorry.
dialog: And he leaves.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: You were saying...
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Yes. The thing is... I have to go away
dialog: today but I wondered, if I didn't,
dialog: whether you might let me see you a bit...
dialog: or, a lot maybe... see if you could...
dialog: like me again.
text: Pause as William takes this in.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: But yesterday... that actor asked you
dialog: who I was... and you just dismissed me
dialog: out of hand... I heard -- you had a
dialog: microphone... I had headphones.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You expect me to tell the truth about my
dialog: life to the most indiscreet man in
dialog: England?
text: Martin edges up.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Excuse me -- it's your mother on the
dialog: phone.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Can you tell her I'll ring her back.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: I actually tried that tack -- but she
dialog: said you said that before and it's been
dialog: twenty-four hours, and her foot that
dialog: was purple is now a sort of blackish
dialog: color...
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Okay -- perfect timing as ever -- hold
dialog: the fort for a second will you, Martin?
text: Martin is left with Anna.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Can I just say, I thought 'Ghost' was a
dialog: wonderful film.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Is that right?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Yes... I've always wondered what
dialog: Patrick Swayze is like in real life.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I can't say I know Patrick all that
dialog: well.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Oh dear. He wasn't friendly during the
dialog: filming?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Well, no -- I'm sure he was friendly --
dialog: to Demi Moore -- who acted with him in
dialog: 'Ghost.'
dialog: She's kind in here, not sarcastic.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Oh right. Right. Sorry. Always been
dialog: a bit of an ass.
text: William returns a little uneasy.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Anyway... it's lovely to meet you. I'm
dialog: a great fan of yours. And Demi's, of
dialog: course.
dialog: Martin leaves them.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Sorry about that.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: That's fine. There's always a pause
dialog: when the jury goes out to consider its
dialog: verdict.
text: She's awaiting an answer.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Anna. Look -- I'm a fairly level-
text: headed bloke. Not often in and out of
dialog: love. But...
dialog: He can't really express what he feels.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: ... can I just say 'no' to your kind
dialog: request and leave it at that?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: ... Yes, that's fine. Of course. I...
dialog: you know... of course... I'll just...
dialog: be getting along then... nice to see
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: The truth is...
dialog: He feels he must explain.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: ... with you, I'm in real danger. It
dialog: took like a perfect situation, apart
dialog: from that foul temper of yours -- but my
dialog: relatively inexperienced heart would,
dialog: I fear, not recover if I was once again
dialog: ... cast aside, which I would
dialog: absolutely expect to be. There are too
dialog: many pictures of you everywhere, too
dialog: many films. You'd go and I'd be...
dialog: well, buggered, basically.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I see.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: I live in Notting Hill. You live in
dialog: Beverly Hills. Everyone in the world
dialog: knows who you are. My mother has
dialog: trouble remembering my name.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Okay. Fine. Fine. Good decision.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: The fame thing isn't really real, you
dialog: know. Don't forget -- I'm also just a
text: girl. Standing in front of a boy.
dialog: Asking him to love her.
text: Pause. She kisses him on the cheek.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Bye.
text: Then turns and leaves. Leaving him.
scene_heading: INT. TONY'S RESTAURANT - DAY
text: The restaurant is in the middle of being deconstructed. The
text: pictures are gone off the walls -- a kettle on a long extension
text: lead is on the bare table behind. They're all sitting there.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: What do you think? Good move?
speaker_heading: HONEY
dialog: Good move: when all is said and done,
dialog: she's nothing special. I saw her
dialog: taking her pants off and I definitely
text: glimpsed some cellulite down there.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: Good decision. All actresses are mad
dialog: as snakes.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Tony -- what do you think?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Never met her, never want to.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Brilliant. Max?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Absolutely. Never trust a vegetarian.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Great. Excellent. Thanks.
text: Spike enters.
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: I was called and I came. What's up?
speaker_heading: HONEY
dialog: William has just turned down Anna Scott.
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: You daft prick!
text: Bella is casually looking at the painting that sits beside
dialog: William. It is the original of the Chagall, the poster of which
dialog: was on his wall.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: This painting isn't the original, is
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Yes, I think that one may be.
speaker_heading: BERNIE
dialog: But she said she wanted to go out with
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Yes -- sort of...
speaker_heading: BERNIE
dialog: That's nice.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BERNIE
dialog: Well, you know, anybody saying they
dialog: want to go out with you is... pretty
dialog: great... isn't it...
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: It was sort of sweet actually -- I mean,
dialog: I know she's an actress and all that, so
dialog: she can deliver a line -- but she said
dialog: that she might be as famous as can be --
dialog: but also... that she was just a girl,
text: standing in front of a boy, asking him
dialog: to love her.
text: They take in the line. It totally reverses their attitudes.
dialog: A pause.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Oh sod a dog. I've made the wrong
dialog: decision, haven't I?
text: They look at him. Spike does a big nod.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Max, how fast is your car?
scene_heading: EXT. TONY'S RESTAURANT - DAY
text: Max's car arrives in the street outside. They pile into the
dialog: car.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: If anyone gets in our way -- we have
dialog: small nuclear devices.
speaker_heading: BERNIE
dialog: And we intend to use them!
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Where's Bella?
speaker_heading: HONEY
dialog: She's not coming.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Sod that. Bernie -- in the back!
text: He shoots out of his door, rushes round and grabs Bella out of
dialog: the chair.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Come on, babe.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. CAR. STANLEY CRESCENT/NOTTING HILL GATE - DAY
text: Max's car is shooting up Stanley Crescent. We are inside and
text: outside the car.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Down Kensington Church Street, then
dialog: Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: Crazy. Go along Bayswater...
speaker_heading: HONEY
dialog: That's right -- then Park Lane.
speaker_heading: BERNIE
dialog: Or you could go right down to Cromwell
dialog: Road, and left.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: No!
text: Suddenly the car slams to a halt.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Stop right there! I will decide the
dialog: route. All right?
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: All right.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: James Bond never has to put up with this
dialog: sort of shit.
scene_heading: EXT. PICCADILLY - DAY
text: The car turns illegally right across Piccadilly the wrong way
text: down a one-way street and ends up outside the Ritz. William
text: sprints into the hotel. Bernie follows.
speaker_heading: BERNIE
dialog: Bloody hell, this is fun.
scene_heading: IT. RITZ LOBBY - DAY
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Is Miss Scott staying here?
dialog: It is the same man.
speaker_heading: RITZ MAN
dialog: No, sir.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: How about Miss Flintstone?
speaker_heading: RITZ MAN
dialog: No, sir.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Or Bambi... or, I don't know, Beavis or
dialog: Butthead?
text: Man shakes his head.
speaker_heading: RITZ MAN
dialog: No, sir.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Right. Right. Fair enough. Thanks.
text: He turns despondent and takes two steps when the Ritz Man stops
text: him in his tracks.
speaker_heading: RITZ MAN
dialog: There was a Miss Pocahontas in room 126
dialog: -- but she checked out an hour ago. I
dialog: believe she's holding a press
dialog: conference at The Savoy before flying to
dialog: America.
text: William is very grateful. He kisses the Ritz Man. Bernie's also
text: gratuful. He kisses him too.
speaker_heading: BERNIE
dialog: We have lift off!!
dialog: A Japanese guest assumes this is the way to behave and the Ritz
text: Man gets kissed a third time.
scene_heading: EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY
text: The car speeds through London. It gets totally stuck at a
dialog: junction where no one will let them in.
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: Bugger this for a bunch of bananas.
text: He gets out of the car and boldly stops the traffic coming in the
text: opposite direction. Our car shoots past him.
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: Go!
text: They leave him behind. Honey leans out the window and shouts...
speaker_heading: HONEY
dialog: You're my hero.
text: Spike waves wildly -- he loses concentration and is very nearly
text: hit by a car.
scene_heading: EXT. THE SAVOY - DAY
text: They pull to a stop. William leaps out.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Go!
scene_heading: INT. THE SAVOY - DAY
text: William rushes up to the main desk.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Excuse me, where's the press
dialog: conference?
speaker_heading: MAN AT SAVOY
dialog: Are you an accredited member of the
dialog: press?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Yes...
text: He flashes a card.
speaker_heading: MAN AT SAVOY
dialog: That's a Blockbuster video membership
dialog: card, sir.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: That's right... I work for their in-
dialog: house magazine.
dialog: (mimes quotation marks)
dialog: 'Movies are our business.'
speaker_heading: MAN AT SAVOY
dialog: I'm sorry, sir...
text: Honey shoots into shot, pushing Bella's chair.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: He's with me.
speaker_heading: MAN AT SAVOY
dialog: And you are?
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: Writing an article about how London
dialog: hotels treat people in wheelchairs.
speaker_heading: MAN AT SAVOY
dialog: Of course, madam. It's in the
dialog: Lancaster Room. I'm afraid you're very
dialog: late.
speaker_heading: HONEY
dialog: (to William)
dialog: Run!
scene_heading: INT. SAVOR ROOM - DAY
text: William runs, searching. At last finds the room, and enters.
scene_heading: INT. LANCASTER ROOM - DAY
text: Huge room -- full of press. Row after row of journalists,
text: cameras at the front, TV cameras at the back. Anna clearly
dialog: gives press conferences very rarely, because this one is
text: positively presidential. She sits at a table at the end of the
text: room, beside Karen: on her other side is Jeremy, the PR boss,
text: firmly marshalling the questions.
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: Yes... You -- Dominic.
speaker_heading: QUESTIONER 1
dialog: How much longer are you staying in the
dialog: UK then?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: No time at all. I fly out tonight.
text: She's in a slightly melancholic and therefore honest mood.
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: Which is why we have to round it up now.
dialog: Final questions.
text: He points at a journalist he knows.
speaker_heading: QUESTIONER 2
dialog: Is your decision to take a year off
dialog: anything to do with the rumours about
dialog: Jeff and his present leading lady?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Absolutely not.
speaker_heading: QUESTIONER 2
dialog: Do you believe the rumours?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: It's really not my business any more.
dialog: Though I will say, from my experience,
dialog: that rumours about Jeff... do tend to
dialog: be true.
text: They love that answer, and all scribble in their note books.
text: Next question comes from someone straight right next to
dialog: William.
speaker_heading: QUESTIONER 3
dialog: Last time you were here, there were some
dialog: fairly graphic photographs of you and a
dialog: young English guy -- so what happened
dialog: there?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: He was just a friend -- I think we're
dialog: still friends.
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: Yes, the gentleman in the pink shirt.
text: He is pointing straight at William, who has his hand up.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Yes -- Miss Scott -- are there any
dialog: circumstances in which you two might be
dialog: more than just friends?
text: Anna sees who it is asking.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I hoped there might be -- but no, I'm
dialog: assured there aren't.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: And what would you say...
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: No, it's just one question per person.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: No, let him... ask away. You were
dialog: saying?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Yes, I just wondered whether if it
dialog: turned out that this... person...
speaker_heading: OTHER JOURNALIST
dialog: (to William)
dialog: His name is Thacker.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Thanks. I just wondered if Mr. Thacker
dialog: realized he'd been a daft prick and got
dialog: down on his knees and begged you to
dialog: reconsider, whether you would...
dialog: reconsider.
text: We cut to Max, Bella, Bernie and Honey, all watching. Then back
dialog: to Anna.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Yes, I'm pretty sure I would.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: That's very good news. The readers of
dialog: 'Horse and Hound' will be absolutely
dialog: delighted.
text: Anna whispers something to Jeremy.
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: Dominic -- if you'd like to ask your
dialog: question again?
speaker_heading: QUESTIONER 1
dialog: Yes -- Anna -- how long are you
dialog: intending to stay here in Britain?
text: Pause. Anna looks up at William. He nods.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Indefinitely.
text: They both smile -- suddenly the press gets what's going on --
text: music -- noise -- they all turn and flash, flash, flash photos
text: of William. Max and Bella kiss. Bernie kisses a total stranger.
text: Spike finally makes it -- he's bright red from running.
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: HONEY
dialog: It was good.
text: Honey hugs him. It's a new experience for Spike.
text: Cut to William's face -- flash after flash -- still looking at
text: Anna. They are both smiling.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. THE HEMPEL ZEN GARDEN WITH MARQUEEN - DAY
text: Anna and William at their wedding -- they kiss and walk into the
dialog: crowd.
text: Honey, a bridesmaid in peach satin -- she is surrounded by at
text: least four other bridesmaids, all under five.
text: Nearby, Tony standing, glowing, beside his fabulous,
dialog: pyramidical wedding cake.
text: William's mother is not quite happy with how he's looking. She
text: tries to brush his hair.
text: Max, dressed in the most devastating Bond-like white tuxedo is
text: dancing with Anna -- thrilled. He does a rather flashy little
text: move. Cut to Bella who is watching and laughing.
text: Martin, in an awkward tweed suit, is jiggling to the beat of a
text: song, entirely happy in the corner.
scene_heading: EXT. LEICESTER SQUARE - NIGHT
text: A huge premier -- screaming crowds -- Anna and William get out
text: of the car, she holding his hand -- looking ultimately gorgeous
text: -- he in a black tie that doesn't quite fit. He's startled.
scene_heading: EXT. GARDEN - DAY
text: A pretty green communal garden. Children are playing, watched
text: by mothers, one of whom holds a new baby in a papoose. A very
text: old couple wander along slowly.
text: A small tai chi group moves mysteriously. And as the camera
text: glides, it passes a couple sitting on a single, simple wooden
text: bench overlooking the garden. He is reading, she is just
text: looking out, totally relaxed, holding his hand, pregnant. It
dialog: is William and Anna.
