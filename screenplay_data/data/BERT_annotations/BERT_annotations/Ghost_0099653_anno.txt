scene_heading: INT. TRIBECA LOFT - DAY
text: The CAMERA TRACKS slowly through clouds of moving dust. Shafts
text: of muted light pierce the dense atmosphere. An eerie
text: netherworld envelops us. Strange ghostly forms appear and
text: disappear in the distance. They seem like apparitions.
text: Broken timbers and dangling cables emerge from the smoky
text: light. We see hints of a huge demolished space.
text: An old white plaster wall FILLS THE SCREEN. Momentary blips
text: of light flash across it. SOUNDS of street traffic are heard
text: dimly in the distance.
text: With startling impact, the SOUND of a sledgehammer explodes
text: out of nowhere. The wall shudders.
text: HAMMER BLOWS assault the audience. They are loud and jarring.
text: The wall buckles.
text: Chunks of plaster CRASH to the floor. The air fills with new
text: swirls of white dust. The SLEDGEHAMMER smashes INTO VIEW.
text: Beams of sunlight cut through the cracks, piercing the
text: atmosphere like searchlights in a fog. A huge section of
text: wall falls toward camera as more plaster billows into the
text: air. We hear voices talking.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (O.S.)
dialog: What a mess!
speaker_heading: SAM (O.S.)
dialog: I told you!
text: Through jagged holes we can make out three dim figures on
text: the other side of the wall, all wielding SLEDGEHAMMERS.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I can't breathe.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Use your mask, dummy.
text: One of the figures adjusts something over his face. Isolated
text: rays of sunlight dance around him casting long shadows in
dialog: the air.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (singing)
dialog: "Volga boat..., man." Whoomph!
text: His hammer pounds the wall. Molly laughs.
speaker_heading: ANGLE
text: The CAMERA MOVES IN and for the first time we see them. MOLLY
text: JENSEN, in her late 20's, has a bandanna around her hair and
text: a workman's mask over her nose, but we can tell from her
text: eyes and cheekbones that she is beautiful. SAM WHEAT, in his
text: late 30's, is also hidden behind a mask, but he has a strong
text: forehead and handsome features. Sweat is dripping down his
text: brow, leaving streaks in the dust. CARL BRUNER, early 30's,
text: removes his mask revealing a good looking young man with a
text: fashionable two-day stubble. Both men have their shirts off.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: ANGLE
text: BLACKNESS AND A LOUD THUD. Suddenly a shaft of light
text: penetrates the darkness. Another thud and more light. We see
text: a hole. The hook of a crowbar enters it, grappling with
text: something around the edges. Then, with a tug and a loud yank,
text: a huge section of tin ceiling crashes to the floor. Huge
text: clouds of dust fly into the air. Molly looks up, astonished.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Sam, look, there's a whole eight
text: feet up there.
speaker_heading: SAM
text: And about eighty years of dust.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: We have all this height, Sam. We
dialog: could add a second floor and put our
dialog: bedroom upstairs. That would leave
dialog: all this space.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (eyeing her curiously)
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: For space. Just space.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Be great for bumper cars.
text: Carl laughs as he looks at Sam. Their bodies, covered with
text: white powder, appear as strange, ghostly figures.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Sam, this may be none of my business,
dialog: but I'm concerned you're doing too
text: much coke.
text: Sam glances down at his white body. They all laugh.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Hey, Sam, turn around.
text: Sam obeys. Molly doodles on his chest, drawing a bow tie and
text: the outline of a tuxedo jacket. Her lines are quick,
text: accomplished, and subtly erotic.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: (offering his body)
dialog: How 'bout me?
text: Molly nods. She reaches out and superimposes an armless female
text: torso over his. His stomach jumps sensually as she touches
text: it. Molly pulls back to admire her work. He looks like a
dialog: Greek statue.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: I'll never wash again.
text: Molly laughs.
speaker_heading: ANGLE
text: Sam, Molly, and Carl are holding their sledgehammers. Molly
text: begins to count.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: All together now. One,
dialog: (they strike the wall
text: with their hammers.
dialog: The wall shakes)
dialog: two,
text: (they pound again.
text: The wall begins to
dialog: give)
dialog: three.
text: In unison, they hit it once more. A massive section of plaster
text: and metal topples to the ground. New clouds of dust fill the
text: air. Suddenly, Sam spies an old jar lying on the floor.
text: Something rattles inside it, a penny.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Hey, look what I found. There's a
dialog: penny inside.
dialog: (he hands it to Molly)
dialog: For luck in our new loft. It's a
dialog: good omen.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: (shaking her head,
dialog: disagreeing)
dialog: You're the good omen.
text: She glances at him lovingly. Carl looks at the two of them
text: and grins.
text: As the dust settles we see, for the first time, the outlines
text: of the space they are working in. It is a huge loft over
text: four thousand square feet. Banks of windows run east and
text: west. Molly steps back and admires the room.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: It's gorgeous.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: You guys lucked out. Hell, I bet you
dialog: could sell it tomorrow and double
dialog: your investment.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Sell it? Carl, we just bought it.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: What I wouldn't do for a place like
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: It's gonna be great.

scene_heading: EXT. MARKET SECURITY BANK &amp; TRUST - HEADQUARTERS - DAY
text: It is morning rush hour. Sam and Carl, both wearing suits
text: and ties, exit the Wall Street subway station and approach
dialog: the Headquarters of Market Security Bank &amp; Trust.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Oh, by the way, Sam, I had to move
dialog: your 3:00 with Bob Kahan to 4:00 so
dialog: you could squeeze in Gary Alan. He
dialog: called yesterday and said he has to
dialog: see you today about the Danway stuff.
dialog: Three o'clock was the only time he
dialog: could make it. Also, the board meeting
dialog: in L.A. has been confirmed for the
dialog: 12th. I got you on a 9:00 a.m. flight.
text: Sam seems preoccupied.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Hey, Sam, relax. This isn't brain
dialog: surgery you're going into.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I hate pitching to these Japanese
dialog: guys. They make me nervous. I mean,
dialog: what am I supposed to say, "Who do
dialog: you think'll win that big Sumo
dialog: championship"?
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Sam, you'll be fine. You're great
dialog: with people.
text: Sam's jacket flares open. He is wearing yellow suspenders.
text: Carl notices.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Hey, nice. I like those.
text: Sam, not completely comfortable wearing them, buttons his
dialog: jacket.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: ...Molly.
text: Carl smiles and then turns to admire a car going by.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Jesus, look at that, a Testerossa.
dialog: That's the car I'm gonna drive when
dialog: I'm making two hundred grand.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Better pay off your Mustang first.
scene_heading: INT. BANK HEADQUARTERS, ELEVATOR - DAY
text: Sam and Carl are standing on a crowded elevator. It is deadly
text: quiet. Suddenly Carl elbows Sam and winks. There is something
text: he wants him to do. Sam hesitates a moment, annoyed, and
text: then relents. He clears his throat.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: So Carl, what did the doctor say?
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: He said it was contagious. Very
dialog: contagious. I shouldn't be going
dialog: into work today.
dialog: (he coughs loudly)
dialog: But what could I do?
text: He sneezes. People on the elevator freeze.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: And what about the rash?
speaker_heading: CARL
text: Not good. It's spreading everywhere.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: On your genitals again?
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Everywhere. He said be sure not to
dialog: touch anyone.
text: We see people trying to inch away. Carl coughs again. They
text: hold their breath. The elevator stops at the next floor. All
text: the passengers get off.
scene_heading: INT. BANK HEADQUARTERS, EXECUTIVE OFFICES - DAY
text: Sam and Carl, laughing, walk through a large office area
text: bustling with activity. Employees, in various cubicles, are
text: talking on telephones and punching information into computers.
text: Sam heads into his executive office. Carl steps into a cubicle
text: across the aisle. ROSE, Sam's secretary, approaches him.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Morning, Mr. Wheat.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Morning Rose. Listen, when the
dialog: Kobiashi people arrive, have Elenore
dialog: take them right to the...
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: They're already here.
text: She points to a windowed conference room. Sam turns around
text: and sees a large group of JAPANESE MEN standing inside.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: They're early!
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: I know. And Andy Dillon called. He
dialog: said they need $900,000 transferred
dialog: to Albany by noon.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Noon? Damn!
text: He hurries over to Carl's cubicle. He is on the phone. Carl
text: cups the mouthpiece.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Hold on.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Listen, Dillon needs $900,000 in
dialog: Albany by noon. Can you transfer it
dialog: to his payroll account?
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Sure. Just let me have your MAC code.
text: Sam pulls out his wallet and extracts a small address book.
text: He jots the code numbers on a piece of paper and hands it to
dialog: Carl.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Discretion, huh?
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: You bet. I'll do it right away.
scene_heading: INT. WELL-APPOINTED EXECUTIVE BOARDROOM - DAY
text: Sam and a group of fifteen somber Japanese businessmen are
text: sitting around a large granite conference table. Sam stands
text: up and speaks a simple greeting to them.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (in Japanese)
dialog: Good morning, Gentlemen. On behalf
dialog: of Market Security Bank &amp; Trust, I
dialog: welcome you to our city.
text: The men smile happily and nod their heads in unison.
speaker_heading: MEN
dialog: Arigato.
text: They look to Sam, expecting more. Uncomfortable, he clears
text: his throat.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'm afraid that's the only Japanese
dialog: I know. But I realize it's not our
dialog: language fluency, or lack of it,
dialog: that brings you to Market Security.
dialog: Rather, I'm sure, it is our banking
dialog: expertise, our ability to represent
dialog: and anticipate all of your banking
dialog: needs. As you know, we are not the
dialog: largest banking establishment in New
dialog: York.
dialog: (his throat goes dry
text: and he takes a sip
dialog: of water)
dialog: But, with combined assets of over
dialog: 200 billion dollars, we have a firm
dialog: commitment to the international
dialog: marketplace.
text: A SECRETARY enters the room and hands Sam a piece of paper.
text: It reads "MOLLY ON LINE 2. URGENT." She hands him a phone.
text: Sam looks surprised. He nods apologetically to his guests.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Excuse me.
dialog: (he picks up the
dialog: receiver)
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: MOLLY
text: dressed in a long, clay covered smock. She is in a potters
text: studio. SEVERAL OTHER POTTERS are in the background working
text: at their wheels. A five-foot high ceramic vase stands beside
text: Molly. It is still wet. She toys with it as she speaks into
dialog: the phone.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
text: A man and a woman are lying in bed
text: when the woman's husband suddenly
text: comes home. Frightened, she tells
dialog: the man he has to leave instantly
text: through the window. He has no time
dialog: to dress.
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
speaker_heading: SAM
text: straight-faced, listening and trying to look as if it is
dialog: important.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Uh hmm.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.O.)
text: It's raining outside. The man, running
text: naked along the street, sees some
text: joggers approaching.
text: The entire contingent of Japanese men is staring at Sam.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.O.)
dialog: (continuing)
text: One of the joggers calls out. "Hey,
dialog: do you always go jogging naked?" And
dialog: the man says, "Yes, always."
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.O.)
text: And then the other jogger says, "And
dialog: do you always wear a condom?" The
text: man looks down, embarrassed, and
dialog: replies, "Only when it's raining."
text: Sam squelches a smile.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Well, that's just fine.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.O.)
dialog: Now just relax and have fun, okay?
dialog: It's not the end of the world if you
dialog: lose this account. You've always got
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Thank you. I'll remember that.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.O.)
dialog: See ya.
text: He hangs up and stares at the Japanese men. A short smile
text: crosses his face.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: A CARVED WOODEN ANGEL
text: eight feet tall, ascending into an afternoon sky. As the
text: CAMERA PULLS BACK we see that we are inside a building and
text: that the angel is dangling outside an open doorway high above
dialog: the street.
text: A group of workmen grab for the angel, but have difficulty
text: bringing it in. Suddenly Molly steps INTO the FRAME.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Where you guys from, the New York
dialog: City Ballet?
text: With a gutsy maneuver, Molly leans out over the sidewalk and
text: tries to grab hold of the ropes. She can't reach them.
text: Suddenly a pair of hands grabs her around the waist. She
dialog: screams.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Saved your life.
text: Sam laughs as he pulls her back into the loft. She does not
dialog: think it is funny.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: You bastard. Don't do that to me.
dialog: You scared me half to death.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Better than seeing this gorgeous
text: body splattered all over the street.
dialog: Here, look out.
text: Sam jumps up, grabs hold of the door's top molding, and swings
text: out over the sidewalk. Molly gasps. Sam's feet push at the
text: angel and send it swinging away and then back toward the
text: loft. Quickly he jumps back, grabs hold of it, and brings it
text: in. The workmen applaud. Molly eyes him with admiration.
text: Suddenly we hear a voice call out.
speaker_heading: CARL (O.S.)
dialog: Sam? Molly? Anybody home?
text: Molly looks to Sam.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Carl? Did you invite him?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: I couldn't keep him away.
text: Carl enters, shakes Molly's hand, and pats Sam on the back.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Hi, Moll. Hi, Sam. So, how's it goin?
text: Before they can answer, a WORKMAN turns to Molly.
speaker_heading: WORKMAN (V.O.)
dialog: Where do you want this?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
text: In the bedroom.
scene_heading: INT. LOFT - DAY
text: As the angel pulls away from camera, we see the newly
text: decorated loft for the first time. It is painted now in lovely
text: pastels. The floor, a huge gymnasium-like expanse, is
text: lacquered with polyurethane. Furniture and boxes are piling
text: up along the walls. Dominating the space, with a kind of
text: surreal presence, are a large number of Molly's sculptures
text: and ceramics. There is also a vintage jukebox. Carl is
dialog: impressed.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Wow! The place looks great. Really
dialog: great.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: You like it, huh?
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: "Like" is hardly the word. I never
dialog: imagined it would be this beautiful.
dialog: This is incredible.
text: A mover lugs in a heavy old chair. Molly sees it.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Sam, you kept that chair?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What do you mean? It's comfortable.
dialog: For T.V. I love that chair.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
text: But it doesn't go with anything.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: It goes with me.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: It's okay, I'll paint it.
text: Sam pinches her ass. Molly smiles.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - DAY - LATER
text: Sam, Molly, and Carl are sprawled out on the floor, eating
text: from Cartons of Chinese food. Frank, a gray cat, eats beside
text: them. Unpacked boxes are scattered everywhere.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: It was the middle of December. I was
dialog: sitting in my old office, the one
dialog: Charlie's in. Suddenly, I heard this
dialog: woman screaming. I thought someone'd
dialog: been shot or something.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: They took away my MasterCard. It was
dialog: Christmas, for godssake.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: She was four thousand dollars over
dialog: her limit.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: It wasn't four thousand. And I'd
dialog: already sent in the payment! You're
dialog: the ones that lost it.
speaker_heading: SAM
text: She's still angry.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: No I'm not.
text: The cat begins nibbling Sam's food.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Get outta here, Frank!
dialog: (the cat scampers
dialog: away)
dialog: You should have seen her. All pink
text: and flushed. Her skin was gorgeous,
text: like a rose. And she's screaming,
dialog: demanding to see the president. So
dialog: Wilton brought her to me.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: You? You weren't even a VP yet.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: She didn't know that.
text: Carl smiles.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Can you believe it? And the next
dialog: thing I know, he's telling me his
dialog: life story. I couldn't believe it.
dialog: Everything. About his divorce, how
dialog: he'd just arrived in New York, how
dialog: he didn't know any women. And all
dialog: with this Montana accent.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What's a Montana accent?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: The one you always slip into it when
dialog: you get nervous. "Yes, Ma'am. Thank
dialog: you, Ma'am. Can I fondle your breasts,
dialog: Ma'am?"
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: I wasn't nervous.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Admit it. You liked me. You were
dialog: interested.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (matter of factly)
dialog: I thought you were cute.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Cute?
dialog: (looking at Carl)
dialog: Do you believe this? I should have
dialog: been Picasso's mistress. I should
dialog: have been living in Barcelona or
dialog: Paris. But no, I'm moving in with a
dialog: New York banker who thinks I'm cute.
text: She looks at Sam and grins. Carl is staring at Molly,
text: obviously turned on by her. He is embarrassed when she catches
text: his gaze and quickly looks away.
speaker_heading: OMITTED
scene_heading: INT. MOLLY'S STUDIO - NIGHT
text: Molly, dressed only in a T-shirt, is sitting at her potters
text: wheel throwing a series of pots. Sam enters the studio. He
text: is barefoot, shirtless, wearing jeans.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: I felt inspired.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: At 2:00 am?
text: She nods and presses her hands into a pot that is forming in
text: front of her. Sam watches the sensual movement of her fingers,
text: molding and forming the clay. She is forceful, assured,
text: gifted. The clay responds to her slightest effort. Slowly,
text: almost unconsciously, Sam reaches for her shoulders and begins
text: kissing them.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You notice Carl's eyes today? They
dialog: were all over you.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: What? Are you jealous? Sam, let me
dialog: tell you something. He's not even
dialog: looking at me. It's you he idolizes.
dialog: He doesn't see me at all... Anyway,
dialog: he's not my type.
text: Sam reaches over her and gently adds his fingers to the clay.
text: Molly looks up at him.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I feel inspired.
text: His hands dig into the clay. Molly smiles. Their fingers
text: seem to dance together. After a moment, she reaches up to
text: him, her clay-covered fingers streaking his face and curving
text: down to his chest. Sam grins and reaches down to her.
scene_heading: MATCH CUT TO:
speaker_heading: SAM'S FINGER
text: as it presses two buttons on his jukebox. We watch as the
text: mechanical arm selects a record and slowly, sensuously, lowers
text: it to the turntable. The arm hovers over the record and then
text: descends. It begins to play. The song is "Unchained Melody"
dialog: by the Righteous Brothers.
speaker_heading: SAM AND MOLLY
text: are dancing in the middle of the dark loft. Moonlight pours
text: through the windows and shines off the floor. Wads of packing
text: paper swirl sensuously around their feet.
text: Molly runs her fingers down Sam's naked back. The moment is
text: sweet and erotic. We watch as Sam slowly draws his fingers
text: down over Molly's face, gently caressing her forehead, her
text: eyes, her lips.
text: Sam slides his hands under Molly's T-shirt, slowly moving
text: them toward her breasts. Her breathing slows. They dance
text: silently, her hair swaying in the soft light.
text: We hear the sounds of their bare feet on the highly polished
dialog: floor.
text: Sensuously, Molly's shirt lifts above her navel as Sam presses
text: into her. Their stomachs touch and part and touch again. She
text: bites her lip. Sam eyes her moonlit form as she strokes his
text: chest, slowly moving her fingers down his torso, around the
text: curve of his hips, and then digging into the back of his
dialog: jeans.
text: Sam leans into Molly and nips at her neck. She stops dancing.
text: Her eyes close. She stands absolutely still. Sam's hands
text: move to her backside. He pulls her closer.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE:
scene_heading: LIVINGROOM - NIGHT
text: SAM AND MOLLY, making love on the livingroom carpet. Paper
text: and packing materials crumble beneath them and scatter across
text: the floor. For all their sensuality, it is their hands and
text: eyes that are most expressive, revealing a tenderness that
text: is deeply moving. Their lovemaking is full of love.
speaker_heading: JUKEBOX
text: The song ends. The jukebox arm retracts and gently slides
text: the record back into its slot.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE:
speaker_heading: OMITTED
scene_heading: BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Sam and Molly are lying together silently. Molly gazes at
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: What's the matter?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: The matter?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: I can tell.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Nothing... really.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: You're worried, aren't you? About
dialog: moving in together?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No. Not really.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Then what? The promotion?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I don't know. A lot of things. I
dialog: just don't want the bubble to burst...
dialog: Whenever something good happens to
dialog: me I'm just afraid I'm going to lose
dialog: it.
text: Molly gently strokes his head.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: You know what?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: I love you. I really love you.
text: He smiles and strokes her cheek.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Ditto.
text: Suddenly the T.V. blares into the room. Sam jumps up, grabbing
text: the remote control unit from under his buttocks. Molly laughs
text: as he turns the SOUND DOWN. The news is on and they are
text: showing the remains of an airline disaster. Sam stares at
dialog: the tube.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Oh Jesus. Another one.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Don't watch that stuff.
text: He motions to wait. Dead bodies litter the screen.
speaker_heading: CORRESPONDENT
dialog: ...It is estimated that 34 people
dialog: died in the crash, the second in
dialog: less than two weeks.
text: The T.V. goes OFF. Sam, confused, spins around. Molly is
text: holding the remote control. She nods for him to lie down.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I should cancel my L.A. trip... These
dialog: things always happen in threes.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Threes? Sam, get serious. Besides,
dialog: you lead a charmed life.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yeah. So did they.
text: Sam looks at her and then back at the screen.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Amazing, huh?
dialog: (he snaps his fingers)
text: Just like that. Blackout.
scene_heading: EXT. WALL STREET ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY
speaker_heading: OMITTED
scene_heading: INT. SAM'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Sam is sitting at his computer. His address book with his
text: access codes is sitting open beside him. He seems perplexed
text: by something happening on the screen. After pushing a series
text: of buttons and getting the same response, he whacks the
text: computer on the side. Carl, walking in the door, sees him.
text: Sam looks up sheepishly.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: A glitch. What's up?
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: The Mark Greenberg and Larry White
dialog: accounts. I can't get in. Your MAC
dialog: code doesn't work.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I changed it.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Why? What's up?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Nothing. I just want to nose around
dialog: a bit... Can you keep your mouth
dialog: shut?
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Yeah, sure. Tell me, what's going
dialog: on.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I think I've stumbled onto something.
dialog: There's too much money in these
dialog: accounts.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Too much money. That's ridiculous.
dialog: How could there be too much money?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: That's what I keep asking myself.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: It must be the computer.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I've been checking.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Yeah, Mr. Fixit.
text: (he hits the computer
dialog: like Sam did and
dialog: laughs)
dialog: Come on, move over. Let me see what
dialog: I can do.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Not yet. I'm gonna dig around a bit.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Okay, okay. Just call me when you're
text: ready for help.
dialog: (he heads for the
dialog: door)
dialog: So, what are you and Moll doing
dialog: tonight?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: We're going to the theatre. She wants
text: to see "Macbeth" at the Spring Street
dialog: Repertory.
text: Carl winces. Sam smiles.
scene_heading: INT. SPRING STREET REPERTORY - NIGHT
text: Sam and Molly are sitting in the fifth row of a crowded
text: auditorium. He is sound asleep.
speaker_heading: ANGLE STAGE
text: A scene from "Macbeth".
text: Sam begins to snore. Molly grabs his nose. He jerks awake.
text: Molly grins.
scene_heading: EXT. SPRING STREET REPERTORY - NIGHT
text: Bright marquee lights sparkle overhead as Sam and Molly exit
text: the theatre. It is a beautiful brisk night.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I loved it.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: I could tell.
text: She smiles and squeezes his arm. They walk silently down a
text: dark street, heading toward their loft. The pavement is full
text: of shadows.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Did I tell you what Marcia said?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Six times.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Six? No I didn't. Sam, don't be so
dialog: blasé. I'll have two major pieces in
dialog: the show. The New York Times reviews
dialog: her gallery all the time. This could
dialog: be huge.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Molly, the "New York Times" is some
text: frustrated little critic with pimples
text: on his ass who flunked out of art
dialog: school. Who cares what The New York
dialog: Times thinks?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Eight million readers, that's who.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Your work's beautiful. That's a fact,
dialog: Moll. It doesn't matter what anyone
dialog: thinks.
text: We can tell from the expression on Molly's face that it does.
text: Sam puts his arm around her. She nestles close to him. Then,
text: suddenly, she stops and looks up. There is an unexpected
text: seriousness in her voice.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I want to marry you, Sam.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (taken aback)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: I've been thinking about it for days.
dialog: More than thinking. I want to do it.
dialog: I want to jump in whole hog...
dialog: (she pauses)
dialog: What is that look for?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (staring at her)
dialog: It's just been so long since... I
dialog: mean, you never wanted to talk about
dialog: it.
text: There is a long pause.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Do you love me, Sam?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What do you think, Moll?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: How come you never say it?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: You say "ditto". It's not the same.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: People say "I love you" all the time.
dialog: It doesn't mean anything.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Sometimes you need to hear it.
text: Sam stops and stares at Molly. He pauses quietly. He is about
text: to speak when A MAN'S FACE emerges from the shadows behind
text: him. Molly gasps. Sam spins around.
scene_heading: AN INTENSE LOOKING MAN
text: is standing in the darkness between two buildings. He stares
text: at the couple for a moment and then steps onto the sidewalk.
text: Sam and Molly stand motionless. The man hesitates and then
text: begins walking the other way. Molly exhales a deep breath.
text: Sam takes Molly's arm and they continue briskly down the
text: street. Suddenly they hear FOOTSTEPS coming after them.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: What should we do?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Let me handle this.
text: Sam stops abruptly and turns around. A gun is staring him in
text: the face. Molly screams.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Your wallet!
text: Sam waits a beat.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Give it to him!
text: Sam reaches for his jacket. The Mugger grabs his wrist and
text: then carefully pulls the wallet out himself.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Take the money. Just leave the wallet
dialog: and my...
text: He swipes Sam across the head. Molly screams. The Mugger
text: whacks her across the face. Sam explodes, plowing into the
text: mugger with all his might.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Sam, No!
text: There is a wild, all out brawl. Sam fights like a mad man.
text: Suddenly the GUN goes off. The Mugger panics and takes off
text: running. Sam charges after him.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Sam!!!!!
text: The two men run down the dark street, but the Mugger is
text: already a full block ahead and disappears into the shadows.
text: Sam gives up. Slowly he turns and begins walking back toward
dialog: Molly.
text: We can see Molly dimly at the end of the block as Sam
text: approaches. She is screaming for help. Frightened, Sam calls
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Molly!
text: She doesn't answer. Sam tenses and starts running toward
text: her. He is just three feet away when suddenly he stops. An
text: expression of pure terror overwhelms his face.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - MOLLY
text: drenched in blood. Her eyes are glazed, on the verge of shock.
text: Panting, she stoops down to the curb as THE CAMERA TRAVELS
text: WITH HER. She grabs hold of something lying in the shadows
text: and pulls it toward her.
text: It is Sam's dead body she is holding in her arms.
text: Sam's ghostly form, still solid to all appearances, stands
text: beside Molly. His eyes are awash in horror and confusion. He
text: seems unable to move. THE CAMERA HOLDS on his face as the
text: full impact of his situation dawns in his eyes.
text: Suddenly he lets out a blood-curdling scream.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No!!!!!!
text: He jumps down toward his body and reaches out to grab hold
text: of his motionless form. His hands make a strange SOUND as
text: they pass right though it. It is terrifying. Sam jumps up,
text: crazed, frenzied, and begins circling Molly. It is as though
text: he is trying to undo what has been done.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: This isn't happening. It's not
dialog: happening.
text: He reaches out to Molly for help. His hand cuts through her
text: shoulder. He screams.
text: FOOTSTEPS. People are running down the street. The sound of
text: SIRENS can be heard in the distance. Two MEN run toward Sam.
text: He yells out at them.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Help me!
text: They run right through him. He gasps in stunned terror.
text: Sam watches helplessly as they reach his body. Molly looks
text: up and begins screaming hysterically. One of the Men grabs
text: her as the other goes for Sam's wrist. There is no sign of
dialog: life.
text: The first Man holds Molly back as his friend stoops down and
text: begins some form of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation. There is
text: no response. Sam bends down, trying desperately to help. It
text: is a futile gesture.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Do it! Do it!
text: The Man bangs on Sam's chest. Blood gushes from the wound.
text: Molly recoils. He bangs again.
scene_heading: CUT ABRUPTLY TO:
scene_heading: INT. LOFT - NIGHT
text: Sam shoots up in bed, panting. It is dark. He stares around
text: the loft in sudden confusion. With a lurch he flicks on the
text: night light. Molly is lying beside him, her head buried
text: beneath a pillow. Sam seems stunned.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Molly? Molly!
text: Tears stream down his face. Molly stirs.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Sam? What's the matter? Is something
dialog: wrong?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Molly!
text: Sam is so relieved to hear her voice that he can hardly
dialog: breathe.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: What is it, honey?
text: Molly, groggy, tries to sit up. Sam reaches out for her.
text: As she turns around, we see A SKELETEL VERSION OF HER HEAD
text: staring at the camera. It speaks.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: (mocking him)
dialog: What is it, honey?
text: Sam bolts upright, screaming. It is a scream so consumed by
text: terror that one fears it will never stop.
scene_heading: CUT UNEXPECTEDLY TO:
speaker_heading: CLOSE-UP OF SAM
text: asleep in bed. He is thrashing at his pillow and moaning.
text: Suddenly, a hand reaches out and touches his shoulder. Sam
text: jumps straight up in bed and kicks wildly at the sheets.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: SAM'S P.O.V.
text: Molly is sitting on the bed looking at him, afraid.
text: Sam stares down at her. He is breathing heavily, not trusting
text: his own senses. His hands clutch at the wall.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What's happening to me?!
speaker_heading: ANGLE
text: Suddenly, a brilliant white light shoots into the room as a
text: host of glowing forms, radiating an intense inner light,
text: float before us. A blinding tunnel spirals in an infinite
text: vortex behind them. Sam is awed and confused. We sense that
text: the light is enchanting him. The entire room begins to
text: disappear in the light.
text: Molly screams.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Don't leave me. I need you, Sam.
speaker_heading: ANGLE
text: Sam turns and sees Molly, only she is not in the bed. She is
text: back on the street. To his amazement, he is on the street,
text: too, still bathed in the soothing light. Frightened, he calls
text: out to her.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Molly!
text: She does not hear him. He calls again.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Molly.
text: There is no response. Sam, deeply troubled, hesitates for a
text: moment. He is torn between Molly and the light. Then, in a
text: painful, but conscious gesture, he turns from the light and
text: walks toward Molly. At that instant, the light behind him
text: disappears with the sound of a pneumatic door closing. There
text: is a sense of terrible finality as the tunnel evaporates
text: into the void. Sam is left on the dark pavement. He stands
text: there a moment, as if in shock, and then begins running toward
text: Molly. An AMBULANCE is rounding the corner.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: OMITTED
scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - NIGHT
text: Swirls of light speed toward the ambulance as car headlights
text: and streetlamps merge in a wild dizzying rush. The SIREN
text: wails into the night.
scene_heading: INT. AMBULANCE - NIGHT
text: Sam's body is lying in the back of the ambulance as a
text: PARAMEDIC applies electric paddles to his chest in an effort
text: to save him. After a moment, he looks up at Molly. We can
text: tell from the expression in his eyes that it is hopeless.
text: Sam yells.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Don't stop! I'm not dead!
text: Molly, kneeling over Sam's body, grabs him and begins to cry
text: in long terrible sobs.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT
text: A DOCTOR, comforting Molly, accompanies her from one of the
text: emergency operating rooms and leads her through a pair of
text: swinging doors into a separate waiting area. We see TWO
text: POLICEMEN and TWO DETECTIVES stand up and approach her.
text: Sam doesn't want Molly to go and begins to follow her, but
text: then seems torn, afraid to leave his body. He turns back
text: just as his corpse, covered in a green sheet, is wheeled
text: into the corridor and parked alongside the wall. Sam seems
text: stunned and inconsolable as he sits down beside it.
text: A wrinkled OLD MAN approaches Sam and joins him on the bench.
text: He begins talking.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: So, what happened to you?
text: Sam is startled, amazed that the man can see him.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: You're new, huh? I can tell.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Are you talking to me?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Relax. It ain't like before, you
dialog: know. It's a whole new ball-a-wax.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: I'm waiting for my wife. She's in
text: 4C. Cardiac wing. She's fighting it.
text: The man sticks his head into the green sheet covering Sam's
text: body. His head disappears. Sam is terrified.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Shot, huh? That'll do it every time.
dialog: Poor bastard. Well, get used to it.
dialog: You could be here a long time.
dialog: (leaning in close)
dialog: I'll tell you a secret. Doors ain't
dialog: as bad as you think. Zip zap. They
dialog: ain't nothin' at all. You'll see.
dialog: You'll catch on.
text: Suddenly there is a loud COMMOTION and we see several
text: PHYSICIANS operating furiously on an Old Man lying on the
text: table beside them. It is a life threatening situation and
text: they seem to be failing.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: He ain't gonna make it. I've seen it
dialog: a million times. He's a goner. See?
dialog: Here they come. Lucky bastard. Could
dialog: have been the other ones. You never
dialog: know.
speaker_heading: ANGLE
text: Before Sam can understand what is happening the entire room
text: fills with a strange preternatural light. Suddenly he looks
text: up and freezes.
text: The amorphous forms he saw right after he died are floating
text: down through the ceiling and reaching for the body on the
text: operating table. They are emitting a powerful light.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Hurry, we're losing him.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: What'd I tell you? Bingo!
text: The glowing forms take hold of the man's spirit and help
text: extract it from his body. His physical form changes instantly
text: from a solid object into an ethereal substance.
text: Sam stares in amazement as the strange beings carry the spirit
text: upward. They evaporate through the ceiling.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
text: He's gone.
speaker_heading: ANGLE
text: The light in the room grows dull instantly. Nurses cover the
text: dead man with a dark sheet as the doctors step away. Sam
text: turns to the Old Man.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Who are you? What's happening...?
text: The Man isn't there. An Orderly approaches the gurney with
text: Sam's body and begins pushing it toward the elevator. Sam
text: jumps in front of him.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: SAM'S P.O.V.
text: as the stretcher begins to roll right through him. The
text: penetration of his physical space is horrifying to Sam. He
text: stands, almost paralyzed, as the body of the Orderly
text: intersects with his. It is a stunning moment of extraordinary
text: strangeness as we witness the atoms and molecules of the
text: Orderly's body passing through his. It is like a glimpse of
text: ultimate chaos, the universe within.
text: Then, in a flash, the Orderly has passed through, but Sam is
text: still shaking. He stares up at the ceiling.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Oh God, help me.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: SAM'S P.O.V.
text: as the ceiling lights and acoustical tiles begin to blur.
text: The hallway grows dark. It is as though Sam is blacking out.
scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY - DAY
text: Slowly, images begin to emerge out of the blackness. It takes
text: a moment to realize that they are scenes from Sam's funeral.
text: The CAMERA TRACKS along rows of mourners as seen from SAM'S
text: P.O.V. He seems to be floating among them. We hear snippets
text: of conversations. It all seems strangely odd and disjointed.
text: Time seems unfixed, malleable.
text: We see a MINISTER standing beside the grave.
speaker_heading: MINISTER
dialog: As we say farewell to our friend Sam
dialog: Wheat, we are reminded of his
dialog: kindness, his generosity, his buoyancy
dialog: of spirit...
text: The CAMERA KEEPS MOVING. Sam's associates from the bank are
text: among the mourners.
speaker_heading: MINISTER
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: All that we treasure, our friends,
dialog: our loved ones, our body, our mind,
dialog: are but on loan to us. We must
dialog: surrender them all. We are all
text: travelers on the same road which
text: leads to the same end.
text: Sam notices a WOMAN in a fancy print dress comforting one of
text: the mourners. The woman looks up at him, smiles, and waves.
text: Sam is surprised. He looks behind him, but no one is there.
text: As he turns back, the woman is walking away. She appears
text: just like any normal person until she approaches a large
text: gravestone and passes right through it. Sam is shocked.
speaker_heading: MINISTER
dialog: As our loved one enters eternal life,
dialog: let us remember that love, too, is
dialog: eternal, that although we will miss
dialog: him, our love will light the void
text: and dispel the darkness.
text: Suddenly, Molly ENTERS THE FRAME. Sam spots her. The CAMERA
speaker_heading: STOPS.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Molly.
text: She does not respond. RUTH, her sister, leans over to her.
text: Tears form in Molly's eyes. A hand reaches out to give her a
text: tissue. Molly looks up. It is Carl. She gives him her hand.
text: He squeezes it with affection.
speaker_heading: MINISTER
dialog: ...and into Your hands we commend
dialog: his spirit. May he rest in peace. In
dialog: the name of the Father, the Son, and
dialog: the Holy Ghost. Amen.
text: The casket is lowered into the ground. Molly approaches the
text: grave. She us a little unsteady. Carl takes her elbow. A
text: shovel is placed in her hands. With great emotional effort
text: she lifts a shovelful of dirt and tosses it onto the casket.
text: It lands with a REVERBERATING finality. Sam shudders.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE:
scene_heading: LONG SHOT - PEOPLE
text: leaving the cemetery. We hear them talking.
speaker_heading: VOICES
dialog: What time you going back to work?...
dialog: What's the buzz on Digital? It's
dialog: sad. He was so young... How's your
dialog: new Honda?... Going away this weekend?
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - SAM
text: desperately alone. Down the hill, people are getting back
text: into their cars. Sam can see Molly being let into a limousine.
text: He stands there staring at his own casket, grieving. Then,
text: after a moment, he turns away. Separating from his body,
text: from his own grave site, he runs after her.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE:
scene_heading: INT. LOFT - DAY
text: Molly is sitting on the couch in the middle of the loft
text: surrounded by FRIENDS and WELL WISHERS. A young GIRL, her
text: niece, cuddles in her lap. People are eating and milling
text: around. Slowly THE CAMERA BEGINS TO PAN. It ends on Sam,
text: standing alone in a corner. In the midst of all the activity
text: he is lost and alone.
scene_heading: FADE TO BLACK:
speaker_heading: ANGLE
text: Raw clay on a potter's wheel spins hypnotically, sensuously.
text: Molly's wet hands press in, shaping it, molding it. A bowl
text: begins to appear. The camera pulls back and reveals Sam. He
text: is sitting on the floor behind her, knees pressed to his
text: chest, rocking aimlessly.
text: Molly looks away from the bowl she is forming. It distorts
text: and bends. Angry, she digs her finger into it. The bowl
text: disintegrates. Tears form in her eyes.
text: Frank jumps up on the bench beside her. Molly stares sadly
text: around the room. Quietly, she begins talking to herself, to
dialog: the air.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Oh God, Sam...
text: Sam looks up.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I picked up your shirts this morning.
dialog: I don't know why. Mr. Reynolds said
dialog: to tell you hello. I broke into tears.
dialog: It's so hard...
text: Sam walks over to Molly. Desperate for contact, he reaches
text: out to touch her cheek, but then hesitates and pulls back.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I think about you every minute. It's
dialog: like you're still here, like I can
dialog: feel you, Sam.
text: He stares at her, hoping, wondering.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I am here, Moll. I am.
speaker_heading: ANGLE
text: Suddenly, as if hearing Sam's voice, the cat begins to hiss.
text: Molly spins around. The cat scans the room. Unexpectedly,
text: Sam's and the cat's eyes meet... With a wild SCREECH, the
text: cat jumps from the bench and takes off running. Sam recoils.
text: Molly stands up.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Frank, what's wrong? Frank?
text: The cat is nowhere to be seen. All of a sudden, Molly freezes.
text: Sam is standing right beside her. It is almost as though she
text: senses his presence.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: (continuing; whispering)
dialog: Sam?
text: She holds very still for a moment. Sam watches breathlessly,
text: loving her, wanting her. Then quietly, hopefully, he reaches
text: out. It is a useless gesture. In a moment of great poignancy,
text: Molly shakes her head and walks right through him. He remains
text: IN THE FRAME, alone.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - DAY
text: Sam, stands in the corner of a large, walk-in closet, watching
text: as Molly goes through his effects. Boxes, scattered underfoot,
text: are filling up with his life's possessions. Molly reaches
dialog: for a shirt.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Wait, Moll. Not that one. That's my
dialog: favorite...
text: She tosses it into a box and then takes down a sweater. It
text: is obviously handmade, about four sizes too big. Sam
text: recognizes it.
text: Molly holds the sweater tenderly and presses it to her cheek.
text: After a moment she puts it back. Then, in a surprising
text: outburst, she cries out and begins flailing at the shelves.
text: Everything comes flying off. Sam reaches out to console her.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Molly, don't.
text: Unexpectedly, Carl comes rushing into the room. He takes
text: hold of Molly and sits her on the bed.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Say something. Help her, Carl.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: It's hard. It's very hard.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: Oh good. That's really good.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: OMITTED
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - DAY
text: Molly and Carl are standing over the kitchen table folding
text: piles of Sam's clothes and placing them into boxes. As Molly
text: lifts one of Sam's jackets, something falls from a side
text: pocket. It is his small black leather address book. Sam stares
text: at it with recognition. Carl sees the book fall and stoops
text: to pick it up but Molly gets it first.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
text: Sam's address book.
text: She skims through it a moment, but the memories it evokes
text: are too powerful for her. She places it carefully into a box
text: labeled "Sam's Things -- Valuable" and continues packing.
text: She finds the old jar with the penny in it. It's marked "For
text: Luck". She holds it tenderly for a moment and then places it
text: on the nightstand beside the bed.
text: Carl discovers some old ticket stubs in another of Sam's
text: jackets. He examines them.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Dave Brubeck. Newport '86. Should I
dialog: toss 'em?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Molly, we hated that concert.
text: She takes the stubs and lovingly puts them in the box. Sam
text: groans.
text: Carl finds a half used package of Rolaids. Molly takes them
text: from his hand and puts them in the box, too.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Oh, you want to save those?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Rolaids? What are you doin' Moll?
text: Molly just stares for a moment.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: I miss him, Carl.
text: Carl comes over and takes her hand.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: We all do.
text: Molly buries her head on his shoulder. Carl strokes her hair.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: ANGLE
text: Carl lifting a pile of boxes and carrying them to the door.
text: Suddenly Molly yells out.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Wait. Wait. Not that one.
text: She hurries over and pulls the "Valuable" box from the stack
text: in his arms. He looks at it with surprise.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Oh, shit. I'm sorry. I don't know
dialog: how that got in there.
text: He turns to the door and then back to Molly.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Hey, Moll. Why don't you come? It's
dialog: like summer outside.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Just for a stroll. It'd be good to
dialog: get out.
text: Molly shakes her head and turns away.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: I can't do it Carl.
text: Carl, annoyed, walks over to her.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Molly... you're not the one who died!
text: Molly stops and looks at him. He has struck home. After a
text: moment she nods her head.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Okay. Just a short walk.
text: He gently squeezes her shoulders.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Thata girl.
text: Before Sam even understands what is happening, they are
text: exiting the loft. Sam jumps up and runs after them.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Hey, Molly! Wait!
speaker_heading: ANGLE
text: The door slams shut. Sam is locked inside. Frightened and
text: desperate, he rushes for the door knob. His hand sinks through
text: it. There is a strange sound, like ELECTRICAL STATIC, as it
text: penetrates the metal and wood. Frightened, he yanks it back.
text: Sam circles the space several times and then returns to the
text: door. Clenching his teeth, he reaches out again. As his hand
text: pushes up against it, we sense that he experiences a subtle
text: resistance. The hairs on the back of his hand vibrate as his
text: ghostly form presses into it. We sense Sam's fear as his
text: entire arm DISAPPEARS FROM VIEW. The grating ELECTRICAL SOUND
text: shudders up his spine.
text: The sight of his amputated limb is unsettling but Sam does
text: not pull back. Slowly he edges in and presses his face into
text: the molecules of the wood.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: SAM'S P.O.V.
text: as atoms and electrons spin past him at frightening speed.
text: There is a sense of a universe in total chaos. Terrifying
text: SOUNDS charge through his body.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: SAM
text: pulling back from the door. He is trembling.
scene_heading: INT. LOFT - AN HOUR LATER
text: THE CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY THROUGH THE LOFT AND GRADUALLY
text: DISCOVERS SAM. He is sitting in a corner singing quietly to
dialog: himself.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: "Singing bye bye, Miss American Pie.
dialog: Drove my Chevy to the levy, but the
dialog: levy was dry. Them good ol' boys
dialog: were drinkin' whiskey and rye, and
dialog: singing this'll be the day that I..."
text: He stops, realizing the last word of the song. He sits
text: silently, staring at the wall.
text: Suddenly, there is a SOUND at the door. Sam's eyes shoot up.
text: The door begins to open.
text: Sam stands up. His face begins to tighten. We know instantly
text: that something is wrong. His eyes fill with a fury we have
dialog: not seen before.
text: The Mugger, the man who killed Sam, is entering the loft. He
text: has a key in his hand and puts it in his pocket. Sam is
text: stunned. The Mugger locks the door.
speaker_heading: ANGLE
text: Sam goes wild. He shoots at the man with all his might,
text: attacking him unceasingly, but with no effect. His hands and
text: feet pass right through him.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You motherfucking bastard! What the
dialog: hell are you doing here? What are
dialog: you doing?
text: The Mugger, unaware that anything is going on, glances around
text: nervously as he moves through the vast space.
speaker_heading: ANGLE
text: Entering the bedroom, the Mugger goes to the dresser and
text: quickly examines the drawers. He is very neat, careful to
text: leave no sign that he was there. He seems to be looking for
text: something but cannot find it.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Suddenly we hear a KEY TURNING in the front door. The Mugger
text: seems startled. He dashes from the bedroom and hides quickly
text: behind one of the large sculptures. We hear the door OPEN.
text: Molly is standing there.
text: Sam goes crazy.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Molly, no! Get out!
text: Molly closes the door and locks it shut. Sam freezes as she
text: heads for the bedroom. She walks right past the Mugger. To
text: Sam's horror she stops and turns to look around. There is a
text: curious expression on her face. Seeing nothing she continues
text: through the loft.
text: The Mugger pulls out his gun. Sam looks on in absolute terror.
text: Molly's purple blouse hits the floor as she begins to remove
text: her clothes. She turns on the radio.
text: Sam doesn't know what to do. The Mugger seems excited by
text: Molly's semi-nudity. He begins skirting the edges of the
text: loft, moving toward the bedroom. Sam is crazed.
text: Suddenly, out of nowhere, Frank appears at the Mugger's feet.
text: Sam's eyes light up. He drops to his knees, crawls over to
text: him, glares into his eyes, and screams.
scene_heading: ANGLE - THE CAT
text: SCREECHES and jumps straight up. His claws shoot out at the
text: mugger's face, ripping into the flesh near his eye.
text: Blood appears. The mugger sees it dripping through his
text: fingers. The sight of it upsets him. He grabs the cat angrily
text: by the neck. It SQUEALS. Molly in her bra, peers from the
dialog: bedroom.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Frank, what's wrong?
text: The Mugger holds the cat's mouth shut. Seeing and hearing
text: nothing, Molly steps back into the bedroom.
text: The Mugger takes the cat and throws it across the floor.
text: Holding his eye, he gets up and rushes for the exit. Sam
text: runs after him, but the door closes before he can get through.
text: He is left inside.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - SAM
text: stares at the closed door in a wild panic. He doesn't know
text: what to do. Then, summoning all of his courage, he takes a
text: blind, running slow motion leap and charges through it.
speaker_heading: SAM'S P.O.V.
text: There is a brief sense of passing through a molecular force
text: field, a miniature universe inside the door.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - SAM
text: as he emerges from the door and lands on the other side. He
text: seems excited to have survived and is very pleased with
dialog: himself.
scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY
text: The Mugger steps out onto the sidewalk and hurries toward
text: the subway. A patch of sleeve soaks up the blood from his
dialog: eye.
text: Sam starts after the man but instantly freezes. Hordes of
text: people crowd the sidewalk. The crush of humanity is
text: frightening. Two lovers, holding hands, are coming right at
text: him. Before Sam is able to move, we hear the sound of their
text: arms cutting through his ghostly form.
text: Sam tries instinctively to dodge the crowds but people
text: approach him from all angles.
text: We hear a BABY CARRIAGE roll through Sam's feet and he nearly
text: falls over trying to avoid it. His instincts will not let
dialog: go.
text: A barrage of images and SOUNDS assaults Sam. It is more than
text: he can handle. Still, he refuses to give up. He stays close
dialog: to the Mugger.
scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK SUBWAY STATION - DAY
text: The Mugger heads down a flight of steps into the IRT.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - DAY
text: The Mugger gets onto a crowded subway car. Sam stands near a
text: corner of the train watching him.
text: Suddenly, Sam notices that something odd is happening. One
text: of the riders at the other end of the car is walking toward
text: him. As he approaches the Mugger, he does not stop, but passes
text: right through him. It takes Sam a moment to realize what is
text: happening, but then it is too late.
scene_heading: ANGLE - THE OTHER GHOST
text: With unholy fury the New Ghost charges into Sam. The attack
text: is so unexpected and ferocious that Sam has no sense of how
text: to defend himself. With unexpected power, the Ghost grabs
text: hold of him and slams him into the subway door. Sam's head
text: plows right through it.
speaker_heading: ANGLE
text: on Sam's head sticking outside of the car as the subway tunnel
text: rushes past him. There is a panicked look on his face. The
text: look intensifies as he turns and sees another train barreling
text: down on him.
speaker_heading: ANGLE
text: on Sam's body inside the car still struggling with the Ghost
text: as the other train shoots by the window. With a huge gasp,
text: Sam shoots back into the car, and wrests himself free of the
text: Ghost's hold. The Ghost flies after him, screeching.
text: Sam surges through the door at the end of the train and finds
text: himself on the bridge between the subway cars. The subway
text: Ghost stares at him through the window with a wild, insane
dialog: look.
speaker_heading: GHOST
dialog: Stay off! This is mine!
scene_heading: ANGLE FAVORING WINDOW
text: With shocking impact, the Ghost's fist goes flying into the
text: window. To Sam's terror and amazement, the window SHATTERS.
text: The Ghost smiles. Passengers scream and Sam dives for cover.
text: Sam stares at the broken glass with fascination and confusion.
text: Suddenly, the train moves from the darkness of the tunnel
text: into broad daylight.
scene_heading: EXT. ELEVATED SUBWAY STATION - DAY
text: The train stops at an elevated subway platform in Brooklyn.
speaker_heading: OMITTED
speaker_heading: SAM'S P.O.V.
text: Sam sees the Mugger exiting the train and frantically rushes
dialog: after him.
scene_heading: EXT. BROOKLYN STREETS - DAY
text: Sam follows the Mugger down a long covered staircase to the
dialog: street.
scene_heading: EXT. 321 PROSPECT PLACE - DAY
text: The Mugger heads toward 321 Prospect Place. The streets are
text: lined with old apartment buildings. Many windows are boarded
text: up. TWO MEN, standing on the corner, are slamming a piece of
text: heavy machinery onto the pavement.
text: Sam hears GOSPEL MUSIC coming from a storefront church and
text: notices a sign, "SISTER ODA MAE BROWN, MEDIUM, SPIRIT READER,
text: ADVISOR." He looks up to a third story window and sees a
text: similar sign with day-glo arrows pointing to the entrance on
text: the street. He seems curious, but then realizes that the
text: Mugger is nearly halfway down the block. He turns and rushes
dialog: after him.
scene_heading: EXT. 321 PROSPECT PLACE - DAY
text: Sam and the mugger approach a tenement building at 321
dialog: Prospect Place.
scene_heading: INT. TENEMENT HALLWAY - DAY
text: Sam follows the Mugger into the building and watches as he
text: opens the mail box for APT. 4D. The name scribbled across it
text: is WILLIE LOPEZ. There's no mail.
scene_heading: INT. WILLIE'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Sam enters Willie's apartment. It is a squalid affair. Peeled
text: paint chips litter the floor. The bed is unmade.
text: Willie pulls open a drawer in a small nightstand and drops
text: in the keys to Molly's loft. Sam sees his wallet. His driver's
text: license, bank ID, and a photo of Molly are there, too.
text: Furious, Sam lunges for Willie but then holds his punch,
text: knowing it will have no effect. He turns instead to a window
text: and, like the Ghost on the subway, smashes it with his fist.
dialog: Nothing happens.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Damn!
text: Willie dials the phone. Someone comes on the line.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: She came home. I couldn't get it.
dialog: Give me a couple of days. I'll go
dialog: back.
text: He hangs up. Sam stares at him in wild confusion.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Get what? Who the hell are you? What
dialog: were you doing at Molly's? What the
dialog: hell's going on?
text: Willie grabs a bottle of wine from the nightstand and lies
text: down. After a moment he reaches over and takes Molly's photo
text: from the drawer. He studies it slowly.
text: Sam stands by the door in a state of motionless rage. There
dialog: is nothing he can do.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Stay away from her!
scene_heading: EXT. BROOKLYN STREETS - DAY
text: Sam storms down the street. His movements seem undirected,
text: utterly aimless. He is seething inside.
text: Suddenly Sam looks up. An old BAG LADY is walking down the
text: street talking loudly to a SHORT WOMAN tagging along beside
text: her. As they approach a street pole, the Bag Lady swerves to
text: the side. The Short Woman, however, walks right through it.
text: Passersby laugh at the Old Lady talking to herself. Sam,
text: unsettled, rushes away.
text: As Sam rounds a corner, a sudden blast of MUSIC explodes out
text: of nowhere. Sam jumps into the street, gasping. A phonograph
text: needle SCRATCHES across a record and the MUSIC STOPS. A
text: woman's voice booms out:
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
dialog: Sorry 'bout that.
speaker_heading: PANNING SHOT
text: to a pair of loudspeakers in a storefront window. The MUSIC
text: blares out once more and SOUNDS of gospel fill the street.
text: Sam looks up. He is back in front of the storefront church
text: with the sign for SISTER ODA MAE BROWN, MEDIUM, SPIRIT READER,
text: ADVISOR, hanging overhead. Below it is another sign. "Contact
dialog: the dearly departed. $20.00".
text: Sam stares at the sign with curiosity. The MUSIC is
text: compelling. After a moment's hesitation, he goes in the open
dialog: door.
scene_heading: INT. STOREFRONT - DAY
text: A record player is sitting near the storefront window, a
text: makeshift microphone placed in front of it.
text: Several rows of folding chairs face a raised platform with
text: nothing on it. A number of people are sitting there, mostly
text: women. One gets the sense that this is a cross between a
text: waiting room and a meeting hall. A black WOMAN steps up on
dialog: the platform and calls out:
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Rosa Santiago.
text: MRS. SANTIAGO tucks a Spanish paperback romance into her
text: purse and heads to a door at the rear of the hall. Sam follows
dialog: after her.
scene_heading: INT. SEANCE ROOM - DAY
text: Mrs. Santiago enters a dark room with a window and door
text: leading to a side street. A paisley bedspread is tacked over
dialog: the window.
text: In the center of the room is a round seance table. Two
text: heavyset sisters, CLARA (39), and LOUISE (36), are standing
text: beside an open closet. It is empty.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Please be seated.
text: Mrs. Santiago sits at the table. She seems apprehensive.
text: Clara steps into the closet and taps on each of the walls as
text: though demonstrating that they are solid.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: My sister will be with us soon.
text: She steps back out and closes the door. Louise inserts a
text: tape into a boom box and then steps forward.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Sister Oda Mae. Grant us the gift of
dialog: your all-seeing presence. Appear for
dialog: us now.
scene_heading: ANGLE FAVORING CLOSET
text: She turns back to the closet and opens the door. Like magic,
text: ODA MAE BROWN, 41, appears standing inside. She is a black
text: woman in a white tunic. The whiteness of her garment makes
text: it look as if she is glowing in the dark. Mrs. Santiago is
text: wide-eyed. Sam smiles as Oda Mae steps into the room.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Mrs. Santiago.
speaker_heading: MRS. SANTIAGO
dialog: Buenos dias.
text: She takes a twenty dollar bill from her purse and hands it
text: to Oda Mae. Clara graciously intercepts the money.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: I understand you are hoping to contact
dialog: your husband.
speaker_heading: MRS. SANTIAGO
dialog: Si. Si.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Well, I believe he's gonna be with
dialog: us today.
speaker_heading: MRS. SANTIAGO
dialog: Oh, tsank you, tsank you.
text: Tears well up in her eyes. She crosses herself several times.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: But there's no telling about the
dialog: other world. You gotta cast out all
dialog: doubt. You gotta believe. Do you
dialog: believe?
speaker_heading: MRS. SANTIAGO
dialog: (nodding her head
dialog: vigorously)
dialog: Si. Si. I believe. I believe.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: And remember, we don't make no
dialog: promises. I can phone up there till
dialog: I'm blue in the face,
dialog: (she points to the
dialog: ceiling)
dialog: ...but it don't necessarily mean
dialog: he's gonna be home. Them folks go
dialog: shopping, they play bingo. It's just
dialog: like here. You can't always get 'em.
text: Mrs. Santiago, utterly fascinated, nods understandingly.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Sure lady!
text: Oda Mae's eyes glance up curiously for a second, as though
text: she heard something, and then she continues.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Okay, let's get ready then.
text: Sam steps back as the sisters get up and position themselves
text: behind Oda Mae. The moment feels rehearsed, theatrical. Oda
text: Mae raises her hands into the air and closes her eyes. There
text: is a hush in the room. Her body begins to tremble. Mrs.
text: Santiago clutches her chair. Suddenly Oda Mae breaks out of
dialog: her trance.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: We got a problem here. I don't think
dialog: he's in. Wait. I feel something. Did
dialog: he know someone who's passed over,
dialog: someone named Anna... Mary...
dialog: Consuela... Maria?
speaker_heading: MRS. SANTIAGO
dialog: Si, si! His mama. She's Maria.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Ah! I knew it. He's with his mama.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: Oh my God...
text: Oda Mae's eyes dart uncomfortably around the room.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: I'm afraid this is gonna be too hard.
dialog: Now I got two souls I gotta contact.
dialog: I don't know about that. It's
dialog: difficult, you know. The pain. The
dialog: effort.
speaker_heading: MRS. SANTIAGO
dialog: I pay more. How much? How much?
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Twenty dollars.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Way to go. Milk her for every penny.
text: Oda Mae jumps up and stares at her sisters. They look back
text: at her curiously. They can't figure out what's wrong. Neither
dialog: can Oda Mae.
text: Mrs. Santiago reaches into her purse. A twenty dollar bill
text: changes hands. Sam watches, amazed at it all. Oda Mae sits
text: down and goes back into her trance. Her eyeballs roll up
text: into their sockets.
speaker_heading: CLARA/LOUISE
dialog: Praise the Lord. Thank you, Jesus.
text: Oda Mae is beginning to shake again. The two women grab her
text: shoulders to keep her from falling out of the chair. Suddenly
text: her whole body stiffens.
speaker_heading: CLARA/LOUISE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Have mercy! Have mercy!
text: Mrs. Santiago stares on in amazement. After a moment Oda
text: Mae's body collapses in a heap. Then, like a phoenix rising
text: from the ashes, she pulls herself up in her chair and assumes
text: a normal pose.
text: After several seconds to get her bearings, Oda Mae begins to
text: speak. Only now she has an entirely new voice. It sounds
text: deep and hoarse, like an old man's. For all its put on
text: theatricality, it is strangely convincing.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Welcome, Rosa Santiago. You are
text: fortunate today. The channel is clear.
text: Many spirits are gathering.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (scanning the room)
dialog: Yeah? Where?
text: Oda Mae jerks. Her eyes dart nervously around the room.
speaker_heading: MRS. SANTIAGO
dialog: My husband?
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: (a bit uneasy)
dialog: I can feel his vibration. Yes, yes,
text: he is drawing toward us now. I can
text: see him coming.
speaker_heading: MRS. SANTIAGO
dialog: Julio! Julio! How is he? How does he
dialog: look?
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Oh, he is a very handsome man.
speaker_heading: MRS. SANTIAGO
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Handsome?
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: In our Father's Kingdom we are all
dialog: handsome.
speaker_heading: MRS. SANTIAGO
dialog: (understanding)
dialog: Julio!
text: Sam looks on dismayed.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
text: He is standing before me. He is
text: wearing a black suit.
speaker_heading: MRS. SANTIAGO
dialog: A black suit? Oh yes, yes. He was
text: buried in that.
text: Mrs. Santiago begins to cry. Sam looks around the room with
text: growing disgust. Then he leans over to Oda Mae and yells
text: into her ear.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What a crock of shit!
text: Oda Mae nearly falls off her chair. She spins around.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Who's there?
text: Sam is stunned. Clara and Louise look at one another in total
text: confusion. This is obviously not part of the act. Mrs.
text: Santiago seems frightened.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Where are you?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (looking around)
dialog: Who?
text: Oda Mae screams and jumps up thrashing at the air. Her knee
text: kicks the table and sends it toppling. Mrs. Santiago is
dialog: terrified.
speaker_heading: MRS. SANTIAGO
dialog: Julio! Julio!
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What's going on?
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Get out of here! Leave me alone!
text: Mrs. Santiago doesn't know what to do. She begins to cry.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Who are you talking to?
text: Clara runs up to Oda Mae.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Keep him away!
text: Louise looks at the empty room.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Are you talking to me?
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Do something. Help me.
text: Clara just stares at her sister. Sam is excited and amazed.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I don't believe this. Hey you. My
dialog: name is Sam Wheat. Can you hear me?
dialog: Sam Wheat!
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Stop it!
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Say my name! Sam Wheat! Say it!
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Talk to me, Oda Mae. Say something.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Sam Wheat!
text: Sam nearly falls on his face. Clara's eyes widen. She is
text: more confused than ever.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Jesus!
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Samweet?
text: Oda Mae runs into the closet.
text: It has a false panel leading to a hidden chamber on the left
text: side and she barricades herself inside it. Clara and Louise
text: stand outside pulling on the handle. They seem frightened.
speaker_heading: CLARA/LOUISE
dialog: Oda Mae! Oda Mae!
scene_heading: INT. CLOSET - DAY
text: Oda Mae is rocking back and forth on the floor praying. Sam's
text: feet enter the frame beside her.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Lord, I swear, no more cheatin'. I
dialog: promise, Lord. I don't want to go to
dialog: hell. I'll do anything. Gimme a
dialog: penance. Just make him go away.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Go away. Hell no. I'm stayin' right
dialog: here!
text: Oda Mae screams, jumps back into the closet, and bolts up
text: against the door. It tears from its hinges and falls into
text: the seance room, nearly crushing Louise. Mrs. Santiago runs
text: out screaming. Oda Mae takes one look around and collapses
text: in a dead faint.
speaker_heading: OMITTED
scene_heading: INT. ODA MAE'S LIVINGROOM - DAY
text: Beads of sweat collect on Oda Mae's brow and cheeks. She
text: seems feverish. Clara and Louise are sitting beside her with

text: appears to be talking to herself until we PULL BACK and reveal
text: Sam nearby.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: My mama, her mama, may they rest in

speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: ODA MAE

speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Girl, if you think I'd come down

speaker_heading: MOLLY

speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: And he cain't carry a tune.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: I know. Oh God. This is all so crazy.
dialog: I can't believe I'm talking to you
dialog: like this. I don't believe in these
dialog: things. I don't believe in life after
dialog: death.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Tell her she's wrong.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: He says you're wrong.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: You're talking to him right now?
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: What? You think I'm makin' it up?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Where is he?
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: How should I know? It's not like I

speaker_heading: SAM
text: I'm holding her hand.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: He says he's holding your hand.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: I'm sorry. I don't believe you. Why
dialog: are you doing this to me? I don't
dialog: believe a word you're saying. Sam is
text: dead. He's dead.
speaker_heading: SAM
text: I'm holding her hand.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: He says he's holding your hand.
text: Molly's hand jumps. Oda Mae looks at her. There is a long,
text: poignant moment. Sam chokes up.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: God, I love her. I love her so much.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: He says he loves you... so much.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: (shaking her head)
dialog: No. He would never say that.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (his eyes brightening)
dialog: Ditto. Tell her "ditto".
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Ditto? What's that mean, ditto?

text: her eyes.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Sam?
scene_heading: INT. LOFT - DAY
text: Molly is pressed up against the edge of the couch listening
text: nervously as Oda Mae speaks. Sam wanders around the room,
dialog: anxiously.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: To tell the truth, I don't know how
dialog: I'm doin' it. In fack, confidentially,
dialog: nothin' like this never happened to
dialog: me before. Now, all a sudden, I can't
dialog: turn it off.
text: (she sees a photo of
dialog: Sam)
dialog: Is this you? Is this him?
text: They both say "yes" at the same time.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: (continuing; to Sam)
dialog: Hazel eyes, huh? You sound like they'd
dialog: be blue.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: I don't understand. Why did he come
dialog: back? Why is he still here?
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Cause he's stuck, that's why. He's
dialog: between worlds. It happens sometimes,
dialog: when their spirits get out too quick.
dialog: He thinks he still has stuff t'do
dialog: down here.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Come on Oda Mae, stop rambling.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Oh, oh, now he's got an attitude.
text: Molly stares at Oda Mae.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I do not have an attitude.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: (to Molly)
dialog: We're having a discussion.
dialog: (back to Sam)
dialog: Whataya mean, you're not angry? If
dialog: you weren't angry you wouldn't be
dialog: raisin' your voice like that.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Goddamn it, Oda Mae!
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Ah ah, baby. That does it. I don't
dialog: talk to anybody who takes the Lord's
dialog: name in vain.
text: She stands up, as if to leave. Molly watches with growing
text: discomfort as Oda Mae seems to be talking to herself.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Relax, Oda Mae.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: You relax. You're the dead one. You
dialog: want my help, then you apologize.
dialog: Nobody talks to me like that,
dialog: understand?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Jesus Christ!
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: (to Molly)
dialog: Excuse me, girl. Time for me to go.
text: Oda Mae heads for the door. Molly is confused.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: I don't believe I'm watching this.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Damn it. All right. I apologize.
text: Oda Mae stops, pauses a moment, and walks back to the couch.
text: Sam, relieved, paces back and forth.
text: Oda Mae's eyes follow his voice as Molly watches her
dialog: curiously.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Please, Oda Mae, I need you to tell
dialog: Molly what I'm saying. You gotta
dialog: tell her word for word.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Monsieur has a message for you.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Molly, you're in danger.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: You can't tell her like that. And
dialog: would you stop movin' all over the
dialog: place? You're makin' me sick.
text: Molly looks concerned. Sam leans into Oda Mae.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Say it!
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: He's sayin' you're in danger.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Danger?... What do you mean?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I know the man who killed me. Willie
dialog: Lopez. I know where he lives.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: He says he knows the man who killed
dialog: him, Willie Lopez. He's Puerto Rican.
text: Molly grows pale as she listens. Her forehead tightens.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Write it down.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Write it down.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You do it!
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Now I'm a secretary.
text: Oda Mae takes a card from her purse and grabs a pencil.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: 321 Prospect Place. Apartment 4D.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: 321? Hey, that's my neighborhood.
text: Oda Mae seems perplexed as she writes it down and gives it
dialog: to Molly.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Molly, he's got my wallet and my
dialog: key. He was in here.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: He's got his wallet and key. He was
dialog: in here.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: In here?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (directly to Molly)
dialog: You have to go to the police. The
text: Mugger wasn't acting alone. It was a
dialog: setup, Moll. I was murdered.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: He says he was set up, that he was
dialog: murdered. He wants you to go to the
dialog: police.
text: Molly stands up, afraid. Oda Mae stands up, too.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I'm sorry. I don't want nothin' to
dialog: do with this.
text: Oda Mae heads for the door as Molly watches in a daze.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Where you going?
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Don't follow me! I've done all I'm
dialog: gonna do.
dialog: (opening the door)
dialog: I'm finished. And I ain't comin'
dialog: back. So don't you come botherin' me
dialog: again cause it's over. I mean it.
dialog: This is it. Have a nice life. Have a
dialog: nice death. I'm goin'.

scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - THAT NIGHT
text: Carl is pacing nervously. He seems very upset. After a moment
text: he approaches Molly. Sam is behind her.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Molly, there's no one on earth who'd
dialog: like it to be true more than me, but
dialog: you've got to be rational about this.
dialog: I understand your desire to hold on
dialog: to him, but this... this is absurd.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: It was real, Carl. She was real.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Listen to her, Carl, goddamn it. She
dialog: needs some support here.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Molly, you're a grown woman. How can
dialog: you believe some fortune teller from
dialog: Brooklyn...?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
text: She was in touch with him.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: I don't believe it, Molly. Not for a
dialog: minute.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Come on, Carl. Open your mind.
text: Carl sits down beside her.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Carl, she knew things.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: What kind of things?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: I told you, the picture in Reno, the
dialog: starfish,... damn it, Carl.
dialog: (with great difficulty)
dialog: She said Sam knew who killed him.
dialog: That he was set up... murdered.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Oh boy. This is getting deranged.
dialog: We're going off the deep end here.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Give him the address, Moll.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: She had a name, an address -- Willie
dialog: Lopez, 321 Prospect Place. She said
text: he had Sam's wallet.
text: Sam smiles. Carl stands up. His voice begins to rise.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: This is sick. This is really sick.
dialog: How can you swallow this crap? Who
dialog: knows if this guy exists? Maybe she's
dialog: just setting someone up.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: That's what I have to find out.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Find out? What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Sam wants me to go to the police.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Sam wants you to go to the police?
dialog: Molly! Jesus! Are you outta your
dialog: mind? What are you gonna tell 'em?
dialog: Some storefront psychic's been getting
dialog: messages from the dead? Do you know
dialog: how that sounds? You're talkin' ghosts
dialog: here, for God's sake.
text: Molly looks suddenly vulnerable.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I'm sorry. This stuff just really
dialog: gets to me.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: You don't believe me. You don't
dialog: believe any of this, do you?
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: (half heartedly)
dialog: I'm trying to, but... Look, if it'll
dialog: make you sleep any better, I'll check
dialog: it out, okay? Now why don't you go
dialog: to bed. Try and get some sleep.
text: Molly looks at Carl, annoyed. She doesn't believe him for a
dialog: second.
scene_heading: INT. CARL'S CAR - NIGHT
text: Carl, in his red Ford Mustang, is speeding up town. Sam is
text: beside him in the front seat.
scene_heading: INT. WILLIE'S BUILDING - NIGHT
text: Carl steps into the lobby of Willie's building. Sam follows,
text: wide-eyed. He seems both intrigued and astounded by what
text: Carl is doing. When Carl stops to read the apartment number
text: on Willie's mail box, Sam is thrilled.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Way to go, Carl!
text: Carl climbs the stairs two at a time and approaches Willie's
text: door. He bangs on it, loudly.
scene_heading: ANGLE - THE DOOR
text: opens a crack as Willie peers out. Carl pushes it hard and
text: it opens the rest of the way. Willie steps back.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Carl, what're you doin' here?
text: Sam freezes as Willie addresses Carl by name. He can barely
dialog: move.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: (scared, in over his
dialog: head)
dialog: Who've you been talking to?
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Talking to? What the hell do you
dialog: mean? What's going on?
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Some woman knows all about you. The
dialog: murder, everything. Where's she
dialog: getting it from, huh?
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: What the hell are you talking about?
dialog: I haven't said a word.
text: Sam is staggered. His body is shaking.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: She knows your name, goddamn it! She
dialog: knows where you live!
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: A lot of women know where I live.
text: Carl is fuming.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: This isn't a joke, man. You find
dialog: that bitch, whoever she is, and...
dialog: get rid of her, you hear me? I've
dialog: got four million dollars stuck in
dialog: that fucking computer. If I don't
dialog: get those codes, if that money's not
dialog: transferred soon, I'm dead. If I
dialog: lose Balistrari's money, we're both
dialog: dead.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Tell him you only wash dirty money
dialog: on the first of the month.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: What is wrong with you? Is everything
dialog: a joke? You were supposed to steal
dialog: his wallet. You weren't supposed to
dialog: kill him. Was that a joke?
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: (casually)
dialog: I did you a favor. Freebee.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Jesus!
dialog: (sickened)
dialog: These are drug dealers, man.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Don't blow this for me, Willie. I've
dialog: risked my job here. I could go to
dialog: jail. A hundred thousand of that
dialog: money goes to me. Now give me Sam's
dialog: key. I'll get that address book
dialog: myself.
text: Willie goes to the desk drawer and takes out Sam's key. Sam,
text: unable to control himself, explodes in a fit of rage. Hauling
text: back, he slugs Carl with all his might. His fist has no
dialog: impact.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You killed me, Carl. You had me
dialog: killed. Look what you've done to me!
dialog: Look what you've done!
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: Carl is on the street heading back to his car. Sam is beside
text: him, yelling right into his face.
text: He is screaming and cursing at the top of his lungs but Carl
text: doesn't hear him.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You fucker! You mother fucker! I had
dialog: a life, Goddamn you. I had a life!
text: From the distance, we see Sam smashing into Carl. It is like
text: hitting the air. For all of his rage and bluster, there is
dialog: nothing he can do.
scene_heading: EXT. LOFT BUILDING - DAY
text: Molly, neatly dressed, exits her building and hails a cab.
text: She hops inside. Seconds later she hops out again, yelling.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: You white fascist bigot. Who do you
dialog: think you are? Bed Stuy's part of
dialog: New York, you know. This is America.
text: The driver speeds off. Molly gives him the finger.
scene_heading: EXT. BROOKLYN STREETS - ELEVATED TRAIN - DAY

text: She is the only white woman on the block and heads turn as
text: she passes.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Hey, Snow, you lost or sumpin'?
text: Molly pays no attention. Children run up to her, stare, and
text: run away.
speaker_heading: TRACKING SHOT
text: When Molly turns down 131st Street, the crowds disperse and
text: she is all alone. There is a sense of menace in the air. A
text: group of young men sitting on a stoop watches as she walks
text: by. One of them whistles. Molly keeps walking.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. WILLIE'S BUILDING
text: Molly sees Willie's building. She walks into the dank lobby.
text: It is dark and full of shadows. Leaning close, she examines
text: the mail boxes. Willie's name is there. She backs away,
dialog: afraid.
scene_heading: INT. LIVINGROOM - DAY
text: A dresser drawer opens and a box labeled "Sam's Things --
text: Valuable" is slowly pulled out. A hand reaches inside it and
text: extracts Sam's address book. As THE CAMERA PULLS BACK, we
text: see that it is Carl standing in Molly and Sam's livingroom.
text: Carl opens the book and quickly jots down a series of code
text: numbers he finds in the back. His eyes sparkle with
dialog: excitement.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - DETECTIVE'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Molly is sitting in a room opposite DETECTIVE SERGEANT THOMAS
text: BEIDERMAN, 48, and SERGEANT DOROTHY WALLACE, 29. Both officers
text: are staring at her as she speaks. She seems very
dialog: uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Look, you've gotta believe me. I
dialog: don't even believe this stuff, myself.
dialog: But this is real. Do you think I'd
dialog: come here if it wasn't real? You
dialog: told me to come if I had any new
dialog: information. Well, here I am.
text: The officers don't respond.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Don't look at me like that. You guys
dialog: use psychics all the time.
text: There is dead silence.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Damn it. I know how this sounds. I
dialog: hear myself saying it and I want to
dialog: cringe. But this woman knew things
dialog: she couldn't have known, intimate
dialog: details.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: How intimate?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Things Sam only said to me.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: (smirking)
dialog: Okay, let me get this straight.
dialog: According to this psychic lady, there
dialog: are ghosts and spirits all over the
dialog: place, watching us all the time,
dialog: huh?...
dialog: (she stands up)
dialog: I'm sorry. I've got important things
dialog: to do.
text: She leaves the room. Molly gives her a dirty look and turns
dialog: to Beiderman.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: I'm telling you. The killer's name
dialog: is Willie Lopez. I've got his address.
dialog: You've got to check it out.
text: Sgt. Beiderman gets up and looks over to Molly.
scene_heading: SGT. BEIDERMAN
dialog: Okay. You just wait here. Let me see
dialog: if this guy's got a record.
text: He heads out of the room. Molly sits back with an air of
text: enormous relief and gratitude. Sergeant Wallace comes into
text: the room again and picks up a folder. Molly waits nervously.
text: After a moment Sergeant Beiderman returns with a police file
text: in his hands. Molly looks up at him, and then smiles at
text: Wallace as she sees it. She feels vindicated. He lays the
text: thick folder on the desk and opens it up. She hurries over
dialog: to him.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: MUG SHOTS OF ODA MAE
text: and reams of police paperwork. WIDEN as Molly stares at it
text: all in sudden shock.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: What are you doing? Where's your
dialog: file on Willie Lopez?
scene_heading: SGT. BEIDERMAN
dialog: There's no file for a Willie Lopez.
dialog: He was probably some old boyfriend
text: she was trying to get even with.
dialog: This psychic woman's record goes
dialog: back a long way. Fraud, numbers
dialog: rackets, you name it. She's a real
dialog: pro.
text: CUT BACK AND FORTH between the records and Molly's stunned
text: reaction. We see recent photos of Oda Mae and others going
dialog: back to her youth. They are fascinating and revealing. We
text: even see photos of her mother and grandmother. In addition,
text: there are pages of arrest records and prison files.
scene_heading: SGT. BEIDERMAN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: 1967. Shreveport, Louisiana. Forgery,
dialog: selling false ID. Served one year.
dialog: 1971. Baton Rouge. Arrested for fraud,
dialog: numbers racketeering. Served ten
dialog: months. 1974. Hattiesburg,
dialog: Mississippi. Fraud, seven months.
dialog: 1984. Albany, New York. Petty larceny.
text: It goes on and on.
text: Molly is overwhelmed by the evidence.
scene_heading: SGT. BEIDERMAN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: This woman's a charlatan. You can't
dialog: believe anything she said.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: This isn't possible. There were words,
dialog: private things. How could she have
dialog: known all that?
scene_heading: SGT. BEIDERMAN
dialog: They have ways.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Ways? What ways?
scene_heading: SGT. BEIDERMAN
dialog: They've got a million cons. A lot of
dialog: times they read the obits. All she
dialog: had to do was see the word "banker".
dialog: Hell, they even go through your
dialog: garbage to find things they can use,
dialog: letters, old papers. They don't need
dialog: much.
text: Molly turns away.
scene_heading: SGT. BEIDERMAN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I bet you threw stuff out, huh? It
dialog: could have been anything. What about
dialog: that underwear she knew all about?
text: Molly's eyes widen.
scene_heading: SGT. BEIDERMAN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Green underwear. I'll bet she zeroed
dialog: right in on that.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: No! She was real. She said things.
dialog: She knew about a sweater I knitted,
dialog: about songs we sang... She knew about
dialog: this place we went, Montego Bay...
text: Molly begins to cry.
scene_heading: SGT. BEIDERMAN
dialog: I'm sorry. I know this is hard. People
dialog: want so much to believe. They're
dialog: grieving, vulnerable. They'd give
dialog: anything for one last moment... money,
dialog: insurance policies. Believe me, these
dialog: people know what they're doing. Look,
dialog: I know how you must feel. You know,
dialog: you can press charges.
text: Molly shakes her head no. Sgt. Beiderman closes the file.
text: Molly sits for a long time. She is in terrible pain.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Oh God, I wanted it to be Sam.
text: Sgt. Beiderman nods his head compassionately and then turns
dialog: away.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON (THE SAME DAY)
text: Molly is sitting in her bedroom. The glow of the late
text: afternoon sunlight casts long shadows across the bed. She
text: seems deeply depressed and alone. Gradually her gaze falls
text: on a jar sitting on the nightstand. In it is the penny Sam
text: found when they were first working on the loft. A label on
text: the jar says, "For Luck!" In a moment of sudden rage, she
text: picks it up and throws it against the wall. It SHATTERS on
dialog: the floor.
scene_heading: INT. CARL'S OFFICE - NIGHT
text: The code from Sam's address book, jotted on a piece of paper,
text: is sitting beside Carl.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: (excitedly)
dialog: God, let this be it!
text: Anxiously, Carl punches the code into a computer and,
text: suddenly, Sam's old accounts appear on the screen. A look of
text: relief wafts across Carl's face.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Oh God, yes!
text: Carl is staring at the same accounts Sam was examining the
dialog: afternoon before he was killed, the accounts with too much
dialog: money in them.
text: Carl picks up the phone and punches a number. Someone answers.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Tony, this is Carl. I'm all set.
dialog: We're fine. Everything's fine. Just
dialog: tell me what you want me to do.
text: A VOICE on the other end begins to speak.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: We want you to transfer the money
dialog: from the 12 separate accounts into a
dialog: single account under the name "Rita
dialog: Miller". Tomorrow, at five minutes
text: before closing, 3:55 p. m., transfer
dialog: the full account to First Island
dialog: Bank of Nassau, registry number 486-
dialog: 9580.
text: Carl writes it all down.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Call us when it's done.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Tell Mr. Balistrari there won't be
dialog: any problems.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I'll do that.
text: Carl hangs up. He seems deeply relieved.
speaker_heading: REVEAL SAM
text: He is standing in front of Carl, watching. Quickly, Carl
text: begins punching commands into the computer. He is setting up
text: the dummy account. Rita Miller, #926-31043.
scene_heading: INT. LOFT - THE SAME NIGHT
text: Molly, in a short terrycloth robe, is sitting in a chair. A
text: magazine is on her lap but she is staring vacantly into the
text: loft. She seems lost in the vast space. Sam is pacing back
text: and forth. There is a melancholy look in his eyes.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Why can't you hear me, Molly? I need
dialog: you.
text: Suddenly the BELL rings. Molly jumps.
text: Molly's finger is on the intercom. She seems unsettled.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Who's there?
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Molly, it's Carl. Can I come up?
text: Sam freezes. Molly is surprised. She hesitates a moment and
text: then pushes the buzzer to let him in. We hear Carl bounding
text: up the stairs.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Don't open it. He's a murderer, Moll!
text: There is a KNOCK. Molly opens the door. Carl seems buoyant,
text: almost celebratory. He has a bag of fruit in his hand. He is
text: still in a suit and tie.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Hi. Thanks. I know it's late. I'm
dialog: sorry to disturb you. I felt bad
dialog: about last night. This supernatural
dialog: stuff just makes me so uncomfortable.
dialog: I don't even read horoscopes.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Don't worry. It's okay.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: No it's not. You needed me to hear
dialog: you and I didn't and that was wrong.
dialog: I want you to know that I'm your
dialog: friend, Moll.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You were never our friend.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: (holding out a paper
dialog: bag)
dialog: Hey, I brought you some Japanese
dialog: apple pears. I know you like them.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: (taking the bag)
dialog: Oh, that's so sweet.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Listen, can I come in for a minute?
dialog: I won't stay long. I've had one of
dialog: those days. Maybe a cup of coffee?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No, Moll. Don't do it. Don't let him
dialog: in!
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: (hesitating)
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: OMITTED
scene_heading: INT. LIVINGROOM - NIGHT
text: Carl, in shirt sleeves and Molly in her robe, are sitting on

speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Are you alright? You look nervous,
dialog: upset.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: (glancing at her thighs)
dialog: What can I tell you. It's been tough.
dialog: Hell, you know. It still hurts so
dialog: much.
dialog: (he poses sadly)
dialog: Then on top of it all... it's the
dialog: responsibilities. They've given me
dialog: my own accounts, but I've had no
dialog: time to adjust. My mind has been

dialog: Where were you this morning? I thought
dialog: you were coming to the bank to sign
dialog: those papers.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: I didn't have time.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I went to the police, Carl.
text: Sam looks at her, amazed. Carl, on the other hand, stiffens.
text: He laughs nervously.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: You're kidding. You really did it? I
dialog: don't believe... What did you tell
dialog: them? What did they say?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: You were right, you know. I felt
dialog: like such a fool. They brought out a
dialog: file on this psychic woman ten inches
dialog: thick. It was awful.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: (relieved)
dialog: A ripoff artist, huh?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (shocked)
dialog: Molly, no.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: The sad part is that I believed her.
dialog: I believed her, Carl.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: It was all a sham.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: (relaxing)
dialog: Sometimes we need to believe.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Why?... I was a fool. I don't believe
dialog: anything anymore. Why would people
dialog: do such things?
text: Sam is devastated.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: (milking it)
dialog: It's hard to face reality, Moll, the
dialog: hard cold facts of it. What you have
dialog: to remember is the love you felt.
dialog: That's what's real. You have to
dialog: remember how good Sam was. How much
dialog: he loved you.
text: Molly holds back tears. Carl reaches out tenderly and strokes
dialog: her hair.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You were everything to him, Molly.
dialog: You were his life.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: (finally crying)
dialog: I feel so alone.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: You're not alone. You're young. You've
dialog: got so much talent. You're
text: fantastically gorgeous.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: (appreciating his
dialog: words)
dialog: Oh God, I don't know what's real
dialog: anymore. I don't know what to think.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Just think about Sam. Think about
dialog: what he meant to you, the years you
dialog: had together, how wonderful they
dialog: were.
text: Carl glides his hand slowly, lovingly across her cheek.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Let your feelings out.
text: Almost imperceptibly, his hand moves down to the nape of her
text: neck. As she moves, her robe opens slightly. Carl notices,
text: glimpsing her nakedness beneath it. Sam notices, too. He
text: freezes.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Life turns on a dime, Moll. People
dialog: think they have forever, that they'll
dialog: always have tomorrow. But it's not
dialog: true. Sam taught us that. We have to
dialog: live for now, for today.
text: Molly can barely contain her tears. Carl moves toward her
text: moist cheeks and kisses them gently. Slowly, he guides his
text: lips to her neck and kisses it, too. It is all hateful and
text: sensual at the same time. Sam turns away.
text: Molly feels Carl's tenderness, needs it. She does not notice
text: his hand reaching for the cord on her robe and slowly pulling
text: it toward him. With a little tug the cord unravels and the
text: robe falls open. Molly is confused, aroused, not sure what
text: to do. She starts to pull it closed. He holds her hand. For
text: a moment they do nothing. Then his fingers reach for her
text: thigh. Her body quivers. Carl feels her openness and pulls
text: closer, his hand rising gently up her naked body.
text: Molly's eyes close. She says nothing.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No!!!
speaker_heading: OMITTED
speaker_heading: ANGLE
text: Sam charges wildly at the couch and begins flailing
text: uncontrollably at the two of them. Unexpectedly his foot
text: kicks out and hits a framed photograph of him and Molly that's
text: sitting on an end table. The picture CRASHES to the floor,
text: the glass SHATTERING.
text: Molly jumps up, the mood suddenly broken. She sees the photo
text: and recoils. Carl reaches for her. She backs away.
text: Sam is stunned by what has happened. He jumps up and tries
text: kicking over another picture but nothing moves. His foot
text: goes right through it.
text: Molly looks at Carl, drying her tears.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: I can't. I'm sorry. I can't. It's
dialog: too soon... You've been great Carl,
dialog: but... I need you to leave. Please.
dialog: I need you to.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Sure. It's okay. I understand. I
dialog: really do.
text: She reaches out and takes his hand.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Look, what if we have dinner tomorrow
dialog: night? Just talk. Can I interest you
dialog: in that?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: NO!!!

dialog: smiles.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT
text: Sam rushes madly down a flight of stairs into a subway
text: station. A train is just leaving. He jumps on board.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - NIGHT
text: Sam begins quickly casing the aisles, looking for something.
text: It is not there. Another train can be seen speeding past the
text: window. Sam takes a running leap and jumps onto it, passing
text: through the walls.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: OMITTED
speaker_heading: ANGLE - SAM
text: disappointed. Suddenly, an express train passes alongside
text: his local. Sam sticks his face inside it. Suddenly, he smiles
text: and rushes onto it.
speaker_heading: ANGLE
text: Sam does not have to stand there long. Within seconds, the
text: terrifying Ghost he had seen before comes charging at him.
text: We notice him more clearly now. He is wearing a dark blue
text: pea coat. There is a grizzled look about him. He has stained
text: teeth and seems perpetually unshaven.
speaker_heading: GHOST
dialog: Get off my train!
text: This time Sam does not back away. He holds his ground. The
text: Ghost lets fire every trick in his arsenal. Posters come
text: flying off the walls. A bag of groceries topples from a
text: woman's arms, an old man's cane flies across the aisle, a
text: boy's Mets cap flips off his head. People on the train move
text: quickly to other cars.
text: Unable to frighten him, the Ghost kicks Sam in the stomach.
text: Sam recoils, feeling it, but gets back up again. He is angry
text: now. He begins raging at the other Ghost. The Ghost is
dialog: shocked.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Teach me how you do that! I want to
dialog: learn! I'm not leaving til you teach
dialog: me!
text: The Ghost, exhausted, looks up at him and smiles with
dialog: appreciation.
speaker_heading: GHOST
dialog: You stubborn asshole.
text: Sam nods in agreement.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: SAM AND THE GHOST
text: sitting in the corner of a deserted subway station. Sam is
text: trying desperately to push a bottle cap with his finger.
speaker_heading: GHOST
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: What are you doing? What are you
dialog: doing? You can't push it with your
dialog: finger. You're dead.
text: The Ghost demonstrates, kicking a garbage pail onto its side.
text: Sam can't quite tell how he did it.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I don't get it.
speaker_heading: GHOST
dialog: It's your mind, you idiot. It's all
dialog: in the mind. The problem is you think
dialog: you're still real, that you're
dialog: standin' on the floor, that you're
dialog: wearin' those clothes. Bullshit! You
dialog: don't even have a body anymore. It's
dialog: all up here. You wanna move things,
dialog: you gotta use your mind. You gotta
dialog: focus! You hear what I'm saying?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: How do you focus?
speaker_heading: GHOST
dialog: I don't know how you focus! You just
dialog: focus!
text: With surprising energy, the Ghost flicks a bottle cap and
text: sends it shooting across the subway platform.
speaker_heading: GHOST
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: It's all in the anger. You gotta
dialog: direct it. You gotta channel it.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'm angry all the time. It doesn't
dialog: do a thing.
speaker_heading: GHOST
dialog: Cause you're angry all over. You
dialog: gotta be angry here, in the pit of
dialog: your stomach. Bring it down here.
dialog: Let it explode.
dialog: (he makes an explosive
dialog: gesture)
dialog: It's like a reactor, you know. Pow!
text: He kicks a Coke can toward Sam. Sam tries to kick it back
text: and misses. The Ghost laughs. Sam gets angry. He tries again
text: and falls on his head. The Ghost laughs louder. Now Sam is
text: really angry. We see him forcing the anger down into his
text: stomach. He holds still for a moment and then kicks at the
text: can with all his might. To his shock and amazement, it sails
text: right through the Ghost's head. The Ghost smiles.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I did it!
speaker_heading: GHOST
dialog: Way to go.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: SAM
text: practicing. He smashes at an abandoned tennis shoe with his
text: fist. Nothing happens.
speaker_heading: GHOST
dialog: From your gut. What do I keep tellin'
dialog: you?
text: Sam's stomach bulges. He tries again. Nothing.
speaker_heading: GHOST
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Give it time! What else have you
dialog: got?
text: Undaunted, Sam tries once more. This time the tennis shoe
text: moves. The Ghost nods his head approvingly. Sam is thrilled.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: How long have you been here?
speaker_heading: GHOST
dialog: Since they pushed me.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Someone pushed you?
speaker_heading: GHOST
dialog: Yeah, someone pushed me!
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: GHOST
dialog: What? You don't believe me? You think
dialog: I fell? You think I jumped? Well,
dialog: fuck you!
dialog: (an unexpected rage
dialog: starts to build)
dialog: It wasn't my time! I wasn't supposed
dialog: to go! I'm not supposed to be here!
text: Venom spews from the Ghost's mouth. Suddenly he rams a
text: cigarette machine full force with his head. The glass SHATTERS
text: and packs of cigarettes scatter everywhere. He throws himself
text: on top of them with terrible longing.
speaker_heading: GHOST
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I'd give everything for a drag. Just
dialog: one drag.
text: He rolls and wallows in terrible frustration, tossing the
text: cigarettes in all directions. Suddenly he looks up and sees
text: Sam. He is unable to control his fury.
speaker_heading: GHOST
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Who the hell are you? Why are you
dialog: hounding me like this? Leave me alone.
speaker_heading: AN EXPRESS TRAIN
text: is shooting through the station. The Ghost throws himself
text: into it and in an instant he is gone.
speaker_heading: OMITTED
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT
text: Sam, all alone, walks through the station. Suddenly, he
text: reaches out and pushes a garbage can lid. It swings back and
text: forth. He is delighted. A beer can is sitting on a bench. He
text: pushes it off, watching it roll across the platform with
text: childlike glee.
text: Looking up, Sam sees an advertisement for Market Security
text: Bank and Trust. He stares at it with great interest. "Special
dialog: Banking for Special People. We make it easy for you."
text: Something registers in Sam's eyes. He yells and jumps straight
text: up, hitting a subway sign with his finger. With great
text: excitement, he runs for the stairs and rushes from the

dialog: Sam?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What is all this? What's goin' on?
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: What'd you do, tell every spook in

speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: I don't.
speaker_heading: SAM

dialog: something we need to do.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Forget it. I'm not doin' anything.

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Give it up? I'm already dead.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Dead, yeah, but you ain't finished

speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Does it look like I'm speakin' to
dialog: you?
dialog: (continuing; to Sam)

dialog: got work to do.
text: Ortisha is totally confused. Oda Mae turns back to her.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: What's a matter? You're supposed to
dialog: be concentrating. How do you expect
dialog: me to do this if you're not
dialog: concentrating? Okay then. You ready?
dialog: Let's do it.
speaker_heading: ANGLE
text: Oda Mae and everyone in the room gets very quiet. One of the
text: ghosts draws close. Oda Mae's eyes roll up into her head.
text: Then, suddenly, an extraordinary thing occurs. We see the
text: spirit pull back and dive right into Oda Mae. Oda Mae gulps.
text: Her nostrils flare. Her eyes bulge.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Oh, Lord! Stop! Whatcha doin' to me?
text: Oda Mae's body goes into bizarre convulsions as the Ghost

speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Get out of here, you little shit!

speaker_heading: SAM

text: in the hidden chamber.
text: Willie, shaking, scrambles to his feet and, before Sam can
text: stop him, BLASTS his gun at the closet door. It is riddled
text: with bullets. Sam screams out. Willie runs to the side door

dialog: here.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Tell him Rita Miller's here.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Just one moment, please.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Don't embellish.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Yes, Sir.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: (turning around)
dialog: Excuse me?
text: She waves him on.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Now listen, this guy Furgeson's a
dialog: real jerk.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Why are you whispering?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (he doesn't know)
dialog: Just be quiet and listen. I've known
dialog: him five years and he still thinks
dialog: my name's Paul.
text: We see the Guard leaning over Mr. Furgeson's desk. FURGESON
text: looks up and sees Oda Mae. He shrugs his shoulders.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: He's a social moron. You don't have
dialog: to worry about anything. Tell the
dialog: guard Furgeson knows you. You spent
dialog: time with him and his wife Shirley
dialog: at the Brewster's Christmas party
dialog: last year.
text: The Guard comes back.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: What is this regarding?
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: What? He doesn't remember me? We
dialog: were together at the Brewster's
dialog: Christmas party. With his wife
dialog: Shirley. They had that lovely tree...
dialog: all those presents. Why, I'll never
dialog: forget all those beautiful...
text: Sam pokes her. She yelps, surprised, and glances around. The
text: Guard gives her an odd look.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Oops. Gas.
text: She forces a smile. He smiles back and then goes over to Mr.
dialog: Furgeson.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: This'll be easy. Furgeson was so
dialog: drunk at that party, he could have
dialog: had a conversation with Tina Turner
dialog: and he wouldn't remember.
text: The Guard whispers in Furgeson's ear. Furgeson appears totally
text: flummoxed. He looks up at Oda Mae, embarrassed, and waves.
text: The Guard motions her to come back. She walks proudly over
text: to his desk. He sticks out his hand.
speaker_heading: FURGESON
dialog: Hello, hello. Of course, of course.
dialog: It's been so long.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: A long time.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Ask how Bobby and Snooky are.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: How are Bobby and Snooky doin'?
speaker_heading: FURGESON
dialog: (perplexed)
dialog: Why, they're just fine, thank you.
dialog: Nice of you to ask. And how is your...
dialog: family?
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Couldn't be better.
speaker_heading: FURGESON
dialog: Well, isn't that wonderful.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Tell him you've been wondering how
dialog: they did on the Gibraltar securities.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: So tell me, Fergie, how did you do
dialog: on the Gibraltar securities?
speaker_heading: FURGESON
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: The Gibraltar securities! Well, it
dialog: looks like we topped out, huh?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: "We sure did!"
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: We sure did.
speaker_heading: FURGESON
dialog: (impressed)
dialog: That was a wonderful tip.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: "Good old Randy".
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Good old Randy. Got a real head on
text: his shoulders.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: "Her" shoulders.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: "Her" shoulders.
speaker_heading: FURGESON
dialog: Sure does. Well... well. So what
dialog: brings you here today?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You're closing an account.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: I'm closing an account.
speaker_heading: FURGESON
dialog: Well... wonderful. Do you have your
dialog: account number?
speaker_heading: SAM
text: 926-31043.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: 926-3143.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: 31-0-43.
text: She looks up into the air. Furgeson eyes her strangely.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Make that 31-0-43... Numbers. I'm
dialog: dyslexic.
text: He punches Rita Miller's number into the computer. A figure
text: appears on the screen. He stares at it for a few seconds and
text: then punches it in again.
speaker_heading: FURGESON
dialog: (trying to be calm)
dialog: Well, Rita, you'll be withdrawing
dialog: four million dollars from us today,
dialog: is that correct?
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Four million dollars?!
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Say "yes"!
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: (gasping)
dialog: Yes! Four million. That's right.
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: FURGESON
dialog: And how will you want that?
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Tens and twenties?
speaker_heading: FURGESON
dialog: Pardon?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: A cashier's check! Tell him a
text: cashier's check.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
text: A cashier's check.
speaker_heading: FURGESON
dialog: Fine. Of course, you realize we're
dialog: required to get some identification
dialog: from everyone. It's just procedural.
dialog: You understand.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Of course.
text: Oda Mae reaches into her purse and pulls out a DRIVER'S
text: LICENSE and a SOCIAL SECURITY CARD. Furgeson gets up and
text: walks away from his desk. He seems unsteady on his feet. An
text: OFFICER at the next desk is using a Brillo pad to clean a
text: stain on her desk. Oda Mae smiles.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: You know, if you put that Brillo pad
dialog: in the freezer, it'll last twice as
dialog: long.
text: The Officer nods appreciatively.
scene_heading: INT. CARD FILE ROOM - DAY
text: Furgeson lays Oda Mae's ID next to her signature card. The
text: signatures match up. He nods his head in approval.
scene_heading: INT. CARL'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Carl looks up at the clock. It is 3:50. He pushes down a
text: button on the phone. A SECRETARY answers.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY (V.O.)
dialog: Yes, Mr. Bruner.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Get me the First Island Bank of
text: Nassau. It's on the rolodex.
scene_heading: INT. MARKET SECURITY BANK &amp; TRUST - DAY
text: Mr. Furgeson returns with Rita Miller's signature card and a
text: cashier's check for $4,000,000. Oda Mae's hand shakes as she
dialog: examines it.
speaker_heading: FURGESON
dialog: I'll just need your signature right
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Sign Rita Miller.
text: Sam looks up and gulps. Molly has just entered the bank and
text: is heading toward them. He jumps up nervously.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I'll be back in a minute. You're on
dialog: your own. Don't say anything foolish.
text: Oda Mae signs a form closing the account. Of course the
text: signatures match. Mr. Furgeson examines them both and smiles.
text: He shakes Oda Mae's hand.
speaker_heading: FURGESON
dialog: Now you be careful with this. It's
dialog: like carrying cash, you know.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: (positively glowing)
dialog: I sure do.
text: Sam rushes over to Molly. He is not sure what to do. He
text: notices a stack of deposit forms on the counter she is about
text: to pass. He hurries to it and flicks the entire stack, a
text: hundred sheets, flying up into the air. Molly, confused,
text: thinks she is responsible and stoops to pick them up. Sam,
text: delighted, flicks another stack.
text: Oda Mae is talking a blue streak when Sam returns to her.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Then my mother took all the money
dialog: from the oil wells and put it in
dialog: gasoline pumps. Every gas station
dialog: has 'em you know, sometimes six or
dialog: more. It adds up.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Oda Mae, come on. We gotta get out
dialog: of here. Say goodbye.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: (abruptly getting up)
dialog: Well, I've got to leave. It's been a
dialog: pleasure doin' business with you.
dialog: Say "hi" to Shirley and Snooky for
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: FURGESON
dialog: Thank you, Rita. I'll be glad to.
text: Oda Mae smiles and leaves. There is a new lilt in her walk.
text: Suddenly Sam looks and sees Molly about to stand up.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Hurry up, Oda Mae.
text: At that second, Oda Mae spots a quarter lying on the ground.
text: She stoops down and picks it up.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: (excitedly)
dialog: What a day!
text: Molly sees her, does a double take, and starts to go after
text: her. Unfortunately, Oda Mae steps onto an elevator before
text: Molly can catch up. The doors close. Molly stops for a moment
text: and then looks back across to the executive area. She sees
text: Lionel Furgeson and hurries over to him.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Lionel?
text: He is surprised to see her and grows instantly solicitous.
speaker_heading: FURGESON
dialog: Molly. How are you?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
text: Lionel, a woman who just left, a
dialog: black lady, about my height, did you
dialog: see her?
speaker_heading: FURGESON
dialog: Well, yes. I just took care of her.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: What did she want? Did it have
dialog: anything to do with me? Did she ask
dialog: about Sam?
speaker_heading: FURGESON
dialog: (not understanding)
dialog: Sam? No. Why?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Was her name Oda Mae Brown?
speaker_heading: FURGESON
dialog: No, Rita Miller. She just closed an
dialog: account.
text: Molly stares at Furgeson. She is not sure what to think.
speaker_heading: FURGESON
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Is there a problem?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: (hesitating, not sure
dialog: what to say)
dialog: No. I guess not. Thanks.
text: She walks away, confused.
scene_heading: INT. CARL'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Carl, in front of his computer, is going crazy. He keeps
text: punching buttons on the keyboard but the same response appears
scene_heading: over and over on the screen. "RITA MILLER, #926-31043. ACCOUNT
scene_heading: CLOSED. BALANCE $00.00."
text: Panicked, Carl jumps up. He moves quickly, erratically around
text: the office and then back to the computer. He punches the
text: keys over and over. The same answer appears on the screen.
dialog: The account is closed.
scene_heading: HALL OUTSIDE CARL'S OFFICE
text: Carl runs through the office. He seems crazed. People look
text: at him.
speaker_heading: LEEDEN
dialog: Carl, is something wrong?
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Is someone playing with the computers?
speaker_heading: LEEDEN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Is this a joke? One of my accounts
text: is closed.
speaker_heading: LEEDEN
dialog: Which account? What's wrong?
text: Carl freezes. He doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: LEEDEN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You want me to call someone?
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: (changing his demeanor)
dialog: No, no. Never mind. It's okay. It's
dialog: all right. I can do it.
scene_heading: EXT. MARKET SECURITY BANK &amp; TRUST - DAY
text: Sam and Oda Mae are walking down the street in front of the
text: bank. Oda Mae is talking to herself.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: $4,000,000. $4,000,000. Lord Almighty.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Oda Mae. Take the check out of your
dialog: purse.
text: She stops. There is a nervous look on her face.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Take it out? Why?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Just do it.
text: Oda Mae, worried, removes the check but holds onto it tightly.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Now endorse it. Sign Rita Miller.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: (in shock)
dialog: Endorse it? Why?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Do what I say.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: That's blood money, Oda. I was killed
dialog: for that money. Endorse it now.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: What are you going to do with it?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: We're giving it away.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Away? What do you mean? To who?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Look to your left.
text: Oda Mae looks at the nuns collecting money for the homeless.
text: She recoils.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Are you outta your mind?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Do what I tell you.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: No!
dialog: (clutching the check)
dialog: I can't.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yes, you can. If you don't do it,
dialog: they'll track you down. Your only
dialog: protection is to get rid of it, now.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Sweet Jesus, you're killing me, Sam.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'm saving you, Oda Mae. You'll go
dialog: to heaven for this.
text: Oda Mae growls at him.
text: With great difficulty, she approaches the nuns.
text: The nuns look at her with curiosity and compassion.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Write "St. Joseph's Shelter".
text: With great hesitation, Oda Mae begins to write. We sense
text: that every word is a torment for her. The nuns politely avert
text: their eyes from the check.
speaker_heading: NUN
dialog: Bless you, child.
text: Oda Mae gives her a dirty look and hands the check over.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'm proud of you.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Don't you talk to me. I don't want
dialog: you comin' round no more. I mean it.
dialog: Understand?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Come on, we're friends.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Friends? Friends?
text: She turns on her high heels and wobbles away. Sam calls after
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I think you're wonderful, Oda Mae.
text: She growls again. In the background we see the nuns secretly
text: peeking at the check. One of them, wide-eyed, faints dead
text: away. The other nun stoops down and fans her face in an
text: attempt to revive her.
scene_heading: INT. CARL'S OFFICE - NIGHT
text: It is after hours. Almost everyone on the floor has gone.
text: Carl, hunched over his computer, is typing furious commands
text: on the keyboard. He looks haggard and worn.
text: Sequence after sequence of coded numbers flash past on the
text: monitor screen. Sam, sitting in a desk chair, watches,
text: smiling.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Search, you bastard! You'll never
text: find it. It's gone.
dialog: (he smiles)
dialog: They'll kill you for this, Carl. You
dialog: and Willie. They'll wipe you off the
dialog: face of the earth.
text: In a moment of childish delight, he pushes his feet against
text: the wall and the chair shoots across the room. Carl looks up
text: and sees an empty chair moving. He stares at it in confusion,
text: and then goes back to the screen. He seems desperate. Nothing
dialog: is working.
text: Panicked and frightened, Carl flicks off the machine and
text: storms furiously around the room. Sam approaches the computer,
text: hesitates a moment, and then pushes the power switch. The
text: computer CLICKS back on. Carl spins around. He stares at the
text: computer curiously for a moment and then turns it back off.
text: Sam, enjoying this, reaches for the switch and FLICKS it
text: back on again. Carl stares at it.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: What the...?
text: Carl watches as the keys seem to depress themselves and
text: letters begin appearing on the screen. He sits down,
text: mesmerized by what is happening. Then his face grows tense.
scene_heading: The word "M-U-R-D-E-R-E-R" is emerging before him.
text: Carl flies out of his chair, frantically running around to
text: see who else is on the floor. He yells out like a madman.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Who's doing that?
text: There is no one there. He hears the computer beginning to
text: type again and hurries back to look at the screen. One word
text: appears. "S-A-M".
text: Carl gasps and smashes the computer with his fist. It crashes
text: to the floor. Electrical sparks go flying as Carl gasps for
dialog: breath.
text: Sam cannot hold himself back any longer. With a horrifying
text: scream, he charges at Carl, jamming his fist hard into his
dialog: ribs.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You bastard! You goddamn bastard!
text: Carl grabs his side.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Ah!
text: He hits Carl again. Carl gasps in inexplicable pain.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: It's dinner time, Carl. Don't you
dialog: have a date with Molly, you creepy
dialog: son-of-a bitch?
text: Sam keeps hitting deeper into Carl's mid-section. Carl doubles
text: over as though he's going to throw up.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Jesus! Oh God!
text: Sam is flushed with excitement. Carl kneels beside his desk.
text: He cannot understand what is happening to him. His face goes
text: stark white as the attack continues.
text: Then, unexpectedly, the assault stops. Sam, exhausted, stares
text: hatefully at his old friend cowering on the floor. Slowly
text: and dizzily, Carl gets up. He looks fearfully around the
text: office and then, holding his stomach, hurries from the room.
scene_heading: INT. LOFT - THE SAME NIGHT
text: Molly, all dressed to go out, is sitting in Sam's easy chair,
text: asleep. Suddenly Carl arrives knocking at her door. He does
text: not look well. Sam is with him.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Carl? Where were you? I thought we
dialog: were having...?
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: I'm sorry. Things just got so crazy.
dialog: I completely forgot.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Old Carl had a little trouble at the
dialog: office.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Forgot? I was worried. Is everything
dialog: okay? Are you all right?
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: I'm okay. I'm alright. Look, can I
dialog: talk to you for minute? Can I come
dialog: in?
text: Molly eyes Carl with concern as he enters the loft.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I need to ask you a question.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: He needs to borrow four million
dialog: dollars.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Molly, I know what the police said,
dialog: but when you thought Sam was here,
dialog: when you thought he spoke to you,
dialog: what did you feel? What did he say?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Why? What happened?
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: (very tense)
dialog: Molly, that psychic woman, I want to
dialog: know what she told you. I want to
dialog: know what she said.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Carl, stop this. It was all a hoax.
dialog: I told you. It wasn't real. She's a
dialog: charlatan.
text: (she hesitates and
dialog: stares at Carl)
dialog: Does this have anything to do with
dialog: her being at the bank today?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Oh shit!
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: (gulping)
dialog: At the bank?
text: Sam tenses. He holds up his hand as if wanting her to stop.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: I was sure I saw her. Furgeson says
dialog: she was taking out money. It turns
dialog: out her name isn't even Oda Mae Brown.
dialog: It's Rita Miller or something.
text: Carl turns white. His eyes bulge. He feels sick.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Stomach. My stomach. Do you have
dialog: anything? Pepto Bismol.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: (worried)
dialog: Sure. Just a second. What's going
dialog: on?
text: Concerned, she hurries from the room. Sam digs his hands
text: into Carl's back. Carl jerks forward in intense pain and
text: begins flailing at the air.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: What are you doing to me. Get away!
dialog: Get away!
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN
text: Sam does not go away. Freaked, Carl runs into the kitchen
text: and rushes to the stove. Quickly he turns on the gas. He
text: looks crazed. Turning to the air, he begins whispering loudly.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: You touch me again and I'll set her
dialog: on fire. I mean it. I'll kill her.
dialog: I'll blow up the whole building if I
dialog: have to. Stay away!
text: Sam jabs at the knob on the stove and begins to turn it off.
text: Carl sees it move. Shocked and frightened, he grabs it and
text: pulls it off, leaving only the tiny stem in place.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Go on, try it again. Let me see you
dialog: turn it off now.
text: Sam, frightened, tries with all his might but he cannot twist
text: it. Carl pulls out a cigarette lighter and gloats.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Try and hurt me. I'll kill her if
dialog: you hurt me.
text: Sam rushes at Carl about to jam his full fist into his chest,
text: but then he stops, afraid. He pulls back, shaken. Carl stands
text: there waiting for a blow that doesn't come. He begins to
dialog: gloat.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: What's a matter? You believe me,
dialog: huh? You better believe me! I want
dialog: my money. I need that money and I
dialog: want it tonight -- at 11:00. If that
dialog: psychic lady doesn't bring it here,
text: Molly's dead.
text: Sam freezes. Molly enters the kitchen. She grabs her nose.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Oh my God. Is that the gas?
text: Carl acts as if that's the reason he came into the kitchen.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: You must have left the stove on.
text: He fiddles with the dials and turns it off.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Just glad I smelled it.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: (confused)
dialog: Me, too.
text: She opens a window.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Molly, I'm sorry. I've got to go.
dialog: Look, there's something going on. I
dialog: can't talk now. Some trouble at the
dialog: bank.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Trouble? What kind of trouble? Is it
dialog: that woman, the psychic?
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: I don't have time to talk now. What
dialog: if I come back? Around 11:00?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Carl, what's going on? Let me help
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: I can't. I'm sorry to do this, but
dialog: it's important. I'll be back.
text: Molly is speechless.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Eleven!

scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
speaker_heading: ODA MAE

text: He stares at the door in total bewilderment. At that instant,
text: a collection of picture frames flies off the breakfront and
text: crashes into his legs. He backs away, spooked.
text: Suddenly, the T.V. flicks ON at full volume and then the
text: STEREO and the RADIO. Lights begin flashing on and off. Willie
text: spins around in total dismay.
text: Summoning all of his force, Sam slams into Willie. Willie
text: recoils in unexplainable pain. He seems very disoriented.
text: His gun falls to the floor. He reaches for it and Sam pushes
text: it away. Willie jumps up, afraid. His eyes dart around the
text: room. Sam laughs.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Who's there? Who's doing that?
speaker_heading: ANGLE
text: A pair of candle holders shoot off the mantle piece and nearly
text: hit Willie in the head. He freaks. Grabbing his gun, Willie
text: runs into the bathroom and locks the door. Suddenly the hot
text: water faucet turns on by itself.
text: Willie is terrified. Steam rises from the sink. Willie tries
text: to get out, but Sam approaches him from behind and appears
text: to dig his hands into his neck. Willie crumples to his knees.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Oh God!
text: There is a SQUEAKING SOUND and Willie looks up. Letters are
text: appearing in the fogged mirror. He stares in disbelief as
text: the word "B-O-O!" emerges before him. He cries out.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Let me outta here!
text: Shaking uncontrollably, Willie FIRES his gun at the mirror.
text: Glass and tiles EXPLODE. Willie is cut and bleeding. He grabs
text: hold of the door and yanks it open.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY
text: Willie rushes to the hallway, charges for the back stairs
text: and stumbles down the three flights to the street. Carl,
text: running down the corridor, rushes after him. Willie drops
text: his gun. Carl picks it up.
scene_heading: EXT. BROOKLYN STREET -- NIGHT
text: Willie runs from the building and careens down the sidewalk.
text: People clear a path as he hurls past them like a madman.
text: Carl, confused, runs after him.
text: Sam, too, races after Willie, unwilling to let him get away.
text: Suddenly, a man obstructs his way. Willie goes flying over
text: him and lands face down on the cement. Before he can get up,
text: Sam is all over him and does not let up. People stand back
text: to watch as Willie does battle with himself. Panicked, he
text: calls out to a bystander.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Help me!
text: People back away. Carl watches in terror. He understands
dialog: exactly what is happening.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: Willie, blinded by his own hysteria, runs wildly into the
text: street. Cars are bearing down on him from all directions. He
text: does not get out of their way.
text: One driver sees Willie coming and swerves to avoid him. His
text: car skids. Another car brakes to avoid a collision and
text: suddenly both cars crash right into him.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Look out!
text: Willie's body is crushed instantly between the two vehicles
text: as his spirit is catapulted into the air still screaming and
text: writhing. His ghostly form reaches out to people for help as
text: they rush past. No one stops.
text: Willie spins around and sees a mangled body crumpled on the
text: street. Suddenly, he recognizes that it is his own dead body
text: lying there. He begins to scream.
text: A bizarre and frightening CLICKING SOUND fills the air. Sam
text: looks up. A group of strange dark figures has emerged from
text: the shadows.
text: With a loud, terrifying shriek, the dark forms swoop down
text: and grab hold of Willie. Sam freezes. In an instant they are
text: dragging Willie, kicking and screaming, down through the
text: sewer grates into the bowels of the earth.
speaker_heading: ANGLE
text: Sam backs against a wall in absolute horror. Carl, standing
text: in the crowd, turns and runs.
scene_heading: INT. OLD LADY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Oda Mae and her sisters are huddling with the old woman in
text: the entryway to her apartment. They all appear frightened.
text: The door is opened a crack and they can see people gathering
text: in the hall outside.
text: Sam walks up to Oda Mae. She feels his presence.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Sam? What happened?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: He's dead, Oda Mae.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Dead!
text: (she utters a sigh of
dialog: relief)
dialog: Oh, thank God. It's over.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No. It's not over, Oda Mae. There's
dialog: still Carl.
text: Oda Mae freezes. She turns to Sam.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Who's Carl?
scene_heading: INT. TAXI CAB - NIGHT
text: Sam and Oda Mae are in a taxi speeding downtown.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Tell him to hurry!
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Can't you hurry up?
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: Listen, lady, I'm going as fast as I
dialog: can.
text: Sam leans forward and pushes at the gas pedal. The cab shoots
text: forward. The driver seems shocked.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Problems?
text: He gives her a dirty look.
scene_heading: INT. LOFT - NIGHT
text: There is a KNOCK at the door. Molly goes to it. Fastening
text: the latch, she opens it a crack.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Carl, is that you?
text: Oda Mae wedges her foot inside.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Molly, it's Oda Mae. I know what you
dialog: think of me, but your life is in
dialog: danger. You have to listen to me.
dialog: Sam's here, too. You gotta let us
dialog: in.
text: Molly tries to slam the door but hits Oda Mae's foot.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Get the hell out of here. I'm calling
dialog: the police.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Go ahead. We want you to call 'em.
dialog: You're in trouble. Let us in.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Sam's death was no accident. He was
text: murdered, Molly. Carl was laundering
text: money at the bank. Sam found out.
dialog: He's dangerous. He tried to kill me.
dialog: He'll kill you, too.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: Why are you doing this to me? Get
dialog: away from me! I know all about you.
dialog: You're a fake. You're just a fake.
dialog: Leave me alone!
text: We see Sam's inside the room with Molly. He gazes at her
text: lovingly for a moment and then calls back to Oda Mae.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Tell her she's wearing the blouse I
dialog: spilled the Margarita on and the
dialog: earrings I gave her for Christmas.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Sam says you're wearin' the blouse
dialog: he spilled the Margarita on and the
dialog: earrings he gave you at Christmas.
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
speaker_heading: MOLLY
text: grabbing hold of her beads. Her hand is shaking.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE (O.S.)
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: See, I'm no fake.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Go away!
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Gimme a penny quick.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Empty your purse. On the floor. Now.
text: Oda Mae obeys. A pile of coins falls on the floor.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (continuing)
text: Push a penny under the door.
text: Oda Mae obeys and a penny slides into the loft. Molly sees
text: it. Sam tips it carefully so it lands upright against the
text: bottom of the door. Pushing gently, he moves the penny up
text: the door until it's eye level with Molly. She watches it,
dialog: amazed.
text: Then, to her astonishment, the penny floats away from the
text: door and hovers in the air. There is a look of wonder in
text: Molly's eyes as it floats toward her.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (continuing; calling
dialog: to Oda Mae)
dialog: Tell her it's for luck.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE (O.S.)
dialog: Sam says it's for luck.
text: Molly stands there dumbfounded. Her face is completely white.
text: After a moment she reaches for the penny. It falls into her
text: hand. There are tears in her eyes.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: HALLWAY
text: Oda Mae standing in the hallway as the door to the loft begins
text: to open. Slowly Molly steps out onto the landing and stares
text: at her, nervously, uncomprehendingly. She hesitates for a
text: long moment and then invites Oda Mae in.
scene_heading: INT. LOFT - NIGHT
text: Molly is on the phone. Oda Mae is beside her.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Right. Yes, it's right on the corner.
dialog: We're a red brick building with the
dialog: entrance on the left side. Please
dialog: hurry. Thank you Sergeant. We'll be
dialog: waiting right here.
dialog: (she hangs up)
text: Police are on their way.
text: Oda Mae takes her and leads her to the couch.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: What do we do now?
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Just wait.
text: There is a period of awkward silence.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Is Sam here?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'm sitting beside you.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: Right here.
text: Molly reaches out tentatively. Sam meets her hand. She
text: flinches for a second but does not pull back.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: (fingering the air)
dialog: Can you feel me, Sam?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: With all my heart.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
text: With all his heart, he says.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'd give anything to be alive again,
dialog: just to feel you once more.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: He wishes he could touch you, just
dialog: one more time.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Oh, Sam.
text: Oda Mae looks away uncomfortably. The CAMERA HOLDS on her
text: face. After a moment she turns around and addresses the air.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Okay, damn it, you can use me if you
dialog: want.
text: Sam looks oddly at Oda Mae.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Come on. Before I change my mind.
text: Suddenly he understands what she means.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: JUKEBOX
text: Sam's finger presses down two keys. We see a record slide
text: out of its slot and move toward the turntable. We know what
dialog: it is going to play.
speaker_heading: ANGLE
text: Oda Mae closes her eyes. "Unchained Melody" begins to play.
text: Sam hesitates for a moment and then cautiously, awkwardly
text: slides his ghostly body into her solid form. We sense Oda
text: Mae's discomfort gradually give way as Sam emerges inside
text: her. After a second her body turns slowly toward Molly.
text: Oda Mae's hand reaches out and with slow, deliberate gestures,
text: touches Molly's hand. Molly swallows hard. She closes her
dialog: eyes.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: ANGLE
text: Sam. It is as though he alone is there with Molly. His eyes
text: are full of tears. He can barely move. His hand glides slowly
text: down Molly's cheek. He seems to be in a state of ecstasy and
dialog: pain.
text: The experience is more than he can bear. He pulls back.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Sam!
text: Molly reaches out, takes Sam's hand, and guides it to her
text: soft lips. Sam can barely breathe. He seems totally absorbed
text: in the experience, the sensation of human flesh.
text: His eyes are absolutely still and full of light. He seems to
dialog: be glowing.
text: Gently, Molly takes Sam's arm and guides him to his feet.
text: Effortlessly, she draws him to the center of the huge loft.
text: With great tenderness, she puts her arms around him and before
text: he knows what is happening, they are dancing. It is a strange,
text: touching image, reminiscent of their first night in their
text: new home. Sam reaches out and slowly draws his fingers down
text: over her face, caressing her forehead, her cheeks, her lips.
text: She stands motionless. Her face shines. She knows beyond all
dialog: doubt that it is him.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: I love you so much.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: ANGLE
text: A LOUD JARRING SOUND. It takes a moment to realize that it
text: is someone KNOCKING at the door. The light slams back into
text: its shadowy substance and Sam comes shooting back into his
text: ghostly form. Oda Mae is standing with Molly in the center
text: of the room. Sam is beside them. He appears shaken and dizzy.
text: There is a another loud POUNDING at the door.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: The police!
text: Molly heads for the door. Sam calls out. He can barely speak.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: (to Molly)
dialog: Wait!
text: Sam tries to go instead. To his amazement and ours he is
text: extremely weak, barely able to move.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What's happening to me?
text: His ghostly functions are diminishing.
text: There is another KNOCK and a voice rings out.
speaker_heading: CARL (O.S.)
dialog: Molly, open up. It's me.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: It's Carl!
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Get out of here! The fire escape.
text: Oda Mae grabs Molly.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Come with me.
text: Oda Mae and Molly run for the fire escape window. We hear
text: Carl yelling in the hallway.
speaker_heading: CARL (O.S.)
dialog: Molly. Open up. Are you there?
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT
text: Carl is standing on the landing. He is holding a gun. He
text: aims it at the lock and FIRES. The door to the loft flies
dialog: open.
scene_heading: INT. LOFT - NIGHT
text: Carl moves rapidly through the huge space.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Molly!
text: It is obvious that no one's home.
speaker_heading: ANGLE
text: Sam, with great effort, rushes at Carl and attacks him with
text: his fists. To his great shock, he has no impact. Carl walks
text: right through him.
scene_heading: EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT
text: Molly and Oda Mae are climbing the fire escape.
scene_heading: INT. LOFT - NIGHT
text: Carl runs to the fire escape window. He looks out just in
text: time to see Oda Mae go into the 7th story window.
scene_heading: INT. NEW LOFT - NIGHT
text: Molly and Oda Mae run through a new loft that is under
text: construction. It is a maze of tangled wires and broken walls.
text: The fire escape window slams shut and nearly scares them
text: half to death. They rush blindly toward the front door. It
dialog: won't open.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
text: Back to the fire escape. Head for
dialog: the roof.
text: Oda Mae reaches the fire escape window just as Carl appears
text: on the other side. She screams. Carl tries shoving the window
text: open. It won't budge.
text: Molly sees some scaffolding leading to the skylight. There
text: is an opening at the top.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: This way!
text: Molly quickly climbs the scaffolding and makes it to the
dialog: roof.
text: With a huge shove, Carl opens the window and rushes inside.
text: The window slams behind him.
text: Oda Mae rushes back toward Molly, but her foot catches on a
text: loose cable and she falls to the ground.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Help us, Sam!
speaker_heading: OMITTED
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
text: A hand falls on Oda Mae's shoulder. She spins around. Carl
text: is standing behind her. She screams as he knocks her to the
dialog: floor.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: I want the check. Just give me the
dialog: check.
text: Molly looks down from the scaffolding and begins to scream.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: God almighty, Carl! What are you
dialog: doing? What have you done!?
text: She descends quickly and runs toward Carl.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Don't interfere! She's a thief. It's
dialog: not her money.
text: Carl kicks Oda Mae. Molly rushes at him, attacking him
text: violently. Carl aims his gun at her.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Keep out of this, Molly!
text: He grabs Oda Mae by the hair.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Where is it?
text: Oda Mae cries out.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: In my purse.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: Over there.
text: She points across the room.
text: Carl sees the purse and yanks Oda Mae toward it. Yanking it
text: off the floor, he tears through it like a wild man. There is
text: no check. He grabs Oda Mae.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Where is it, goddamn it? Where is
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: I gave it away.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: You're lying! Don't lie to me!
text: He aims his gun at her eye and is about to FIRE when,
text: suddenly, something shoves him to the floor. Carl screams
text: and jumps back, tripping over Oda Mae. Sam is standing there.
text: In total panic, Carl scrambles to get up. Horrified, he SHOOTS
text: his gun blindly into the air. Molly and Oda Mae dive for
text: cover. The bullets have no impact. Sam musters all his
text: strength and shoves Carl again. White with fear, Carl grabs
text: Molly and aims his gun at her head.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I'll kill her. You touch me and I'll
dialog: kill her. I mean it, Sam. Just give
dialog: me the check.
text: The gun is cocked at her temple. No one moves. Slowly the
text: camera dollies toward Carl.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Sam, please. I didn't mean for him
dialog: to kill you. It's not my fault. Come
dialog: on, Sam, give me the check. Give it
dialog: to me and I'll leave her alone.
text: Nothing happens. Carl looks nervous.
speaker_heading: ANGLE
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Sam? Sam?
text: In a wild explosive fury, Sam charges at Carl and smashes at
text: his gun. The weapon flies out of Carl's hand. Empowered by
text: an anger we have not seen before, Sam smashes into Carl with
text: a violent force. Carl's body careens into walls and
text: floorboards. Wiring snaps. Two-by-fours crack.
text: Carl, crawling desperately to escape, sees his gun on the
text: floor. With a wild rush, he grabs for it and shoots at the
text: door. The lock explodes and the door flies open.
text: Carl tries to run for it, but Sam cuts in front of him. With
text: growing power, Sam sends Carl flying back into the apartment,
text: colliding into a tall scaffold. Bags of plaster topple to
text: the ground as mounds of plaster dust hurl into the air. The
text: apartment looks like a scene from another world.
text: Carl, in a state of total unrelieved panic, breaks away from
text: Sam. The dust obscures his escape. Like a trapped insect, he
text: scrambles furiously to the fire escape window. Sam cannot
dialog: see him.
text: Carl shoves at the window. It is stuck. With a supreme effort,
text: he grabs a ripped bag of plaster and swings it at the glass.
text: Half of its plaster spews across the room before smashing
text: the window. Shards of glass fly in all directions. Sam turns
text: and sees Carl. He surges after him, but knows he cannot get
dialog: to him in time.
text: Carl is halfway out the window when Sam's fist slams into an
text: electrical box attached to a dangling BX cable. It goes flying
text: toward the window. To his amazement, it hits the frame. A
text: huge pane of glass dislodges and comes crashing down. Carl
text: looks up just in time to see the pointed edge aiming for his
text: chest. Before he can move, it pierces him between the ribs
text: and slices into his heart. His body quivers.
text: Carl's eyes bulge from their sockets. His body begins to
text: spasm. He can't get up. A look of abject terror flashes
text: through his eyes. He tries to scream. There is no sound. He
text: tries to breathe. There is no breath.
speaker_heading: ANGLE
text: With one last effort, Carl lurches forward. To his amazement,
text: his body stands up and pulls away from the window. He looks
text: down at his chest and is amazed to see that the glass is
text: gone. There is no blood. Excited and confused, he turns around
text: and sees Sam. For a moment, he cannot comprehend what is
dialog: happening.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Sam?
text: There is a strange, silent moment between them.
text: Then, seemingly out of nowhere, a terrible CLICKING sound is
text: heard. Frightening black forms are emerging from the darkness.
text: Carl looks behind him and gasps. Past the figures coming
text: toward him, he sees his own dead body. It is pinned to the
text: window sill.
text: Before Carl can cry out, the dark figures swoop down and
text: envelope him. In a flash, his spirit is caught and surges
text: with the dark forces back into the shadows. Far in some
text: invisible distance, we can barely hear him scream.
text: And then it is silent. It is over.
speaker_heading: ANGLE
text: Molly is crouched in the corner, her back pressed tightly
text: against the wall. She is staring into space. The room is
text: filled with plaster dust. Slowly, emerging from the dust, we
text: see Sam approaching Molly. He gazes at her with terrible
dialog: longing.
text: Suddenly, a brilliant light glows from behind the ceiling
text: and the skylight floods the room with a golden haze. Sam
text: turns to look at it. His eyes are full of surprise and wonder.
text: The spirits beyond the ceiling are beckoning to him. As he
text: looks down, he notices that his hands are growing transparent.
text: His body is beginning to fade. A faint smile forms on his
text: face. He leans down toward Molly, staring at her for a long,
text: silent moment.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Goodbye, Moll.
text: Molly's head lifts up. She looks around.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Sam? Is that you?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: Molly?!
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: I hear you, Sam.
text: She starts to cry.
text: Gradually, we notice that the dust in the air near Molly is
text: beginning to shimmer with a subtle glow. To her astonishment,
text: Sam's spirit is reflected in the floating particles.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Oh God!
text: Sam's luminous form appears before her. Molly is overwhelmed
text: by the sight of him. The two of them gaze at one another
text: without moving. They know it is for the last time. It is a
text: silent exchange, charged with emotion.
text: Slowly, the two bodies reach forward. As their lips touch,
text: the plaster dust swirls sensuously through Sam's vaporous
text: image and he begins to disappear. Molly pulls back from him
text: as though from a cloud. His voice rises from the mist.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I can't stay anymore.
text: Tears roll down her cheek.
text: The brilliant light intensifies. It is beautiful, like a
text: sunrise, saturating the room with a warm, comforting glow.
text: Molly looks up and sees it all. Oda Mae sees it, too.
speaker_heading: ODA MAE
dialog: They're waiting for you, Sam.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: I know. Goodbye, Oda Mae.
dialog: (with deep felt
dialog: gratitude)
dialog: Thank you. Your mama would be proud.
text: Oda Mae smiles warmly.
text: Sam turns to Molly. She is gazing at the last remaining
text: moments of him. Her eyes brim over with tears and love.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I love you, Molly. I've always loved
dialog: you.
text: Molly swallows hard and wipes her eyes.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Ditto.
text: The light inside Sam intensifies. A sweet smile emerges on
text: his lips.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: It's so amazing, Moll...
text: His face fills with joy.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: The love inside.
text: He whispers, almost crying.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You take it with you.
text: They are his last words. His spirit dissolves within its
text: ghostly moorings and begins to evaporate. Molly looks up
text: silently for a moment, her face filled with love.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: See ya.
text: We see Sam's spirit rise from the room. It passes effortlessly
text: through the ceiling and, in seconds, he is gone. The room
text: grows dark.
text: Molly sits quietly on the floor. There is a look of awe and
text: wonder in her eyes. After a moment, Oda Mae reaches down to
text: help her up. Molly looks at her lovingly and then gently
text: takes her hand. Arm in arm, supporting one another, they
text: walk quietly from the room.
