speaker_heading: CELIA

speaker_heading: JOHNNY

speaker_heading: CELIA
dialog: I don't know what's taking us so

text: Johnny brushes hair from Celia's face.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY

speaker_heading: SKEETER

speaker_heading: SKEETER (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: AIBILEEN
dialog: Yes, ma'am, it is.

speaker_heading: SKEETER
dialog: Aibileen? How could she just quit

text: Aibileen stops wiping and looks up to Skeeter...
speaker_heading: AIBILEEN
dialog: Quit?
speaker_heading: SKEETER
dialog: Yes. When I got home from school

dialog: Back in March to go live with her

speaker_heading: SKEETER

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CONSTANTINE'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Skeeter enters to find only a small bed, dresser, table,

dialog: Past intruders have long since taken anything of value.
dialog: 21.
dialog: 
text: As Skeeter approaches Constantine's bed, an OPOSSUM scurries

text: Skeeter screams as the opossum runs out the door. Her eyes

speaker_heading: SKEETER

speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Is this a little too young?
speaker_heading: SKEETER
dialog: It's a little too everything.

dialog: 
text: Charlotte removes the wig with a sigh. Only now do we

text: Charlotte puts on a classic bouffant/flip in dark brown.
speaker_heading: SKEETER (CONT'D)
dialog: Much better.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Your daddy bought me this dress in

speaker_heading: SKEETER

speaker_heading: CONSTANTINE-
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: -Right after Ole Miss won the Sugar

speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on, you try it on.
speaker_heading: SKEETER
dialog: What really happened?
text: Charlotte winces with pain and grasps her stomach.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: I told you...she went to live with
dialog: her people in Chicago...Now,
dialog: Skeeter, your mother is dying, and
dialog: she wants to see you in this dress.
text: Charlotte stands in her slip and bra holding the dress.
text: Skeeter begins taking off her clothes.
speaker_heading: SKEETER
dialog: How could she just take off without
dialog: telling me?
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: I told her not to write you. I
dialog: didn't want you upset in the middle
dialog: of final exams. Honey, we were
dialog: just a job to her. With them it's
dialog: all about money...Did I tell you
dialog: Fanny Peatrow got engaged? After
dialog: she got that teller job, her mother
dialog: said she was just swimming in
dialog: proposals.
speaker_heading: SKEETER
dialog: Good for "Fat Fanny Peatrow."
text: She lowers the dress over Skeeter's head and zips it.

speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: This looks precious on you! Four

dialog: with?
scene_heading: SKEETER CHARLOTTE
text: A diploma. A pretty piece of paper.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
dialog: Hilly and Elizabeth have such

speaker_heading: SKEETER

speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE

speaker_heading: SKEETER
dialog: Well, I did get a job today.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: You did?
speaker_heading: SKEETER
dialog: Writing...for The Jackson Journal.

speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Great. You can write my obituary.
dialog: "Charlotte Phelan dead. Her

speaker_heading: SKEETER
dialog: Momma, would it really be so
dialog: terrible if I never met a husband?
text: With that, Charlotte grabs Skeeter's hand and takes her to a
text: love seat. They sit. This is serious.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: I need to...ask you something,
dialog: Skeeter. I read the other day
dialog: about how some girls...get
text: unbalanced, start thinking
dialog: these...well, unnatural thoughts.
text: Charlotte begins to twist the handkerchief she holds.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you...do you...find men

text: Charlotte shuts her eyes tight.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)

dialog: of broth.
text: Skeeter sits next to her Father, ROBERT PHELAN, 60.

speaker_heading: PASCAGOLUA
dialog: Sorry, Miss Eugenia.
speaker_heading: SKEETER
dialog: Last time I had an almond, I

speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Oh my Lord.
speaker_heading: SKEETER
dialog: It's okay, Rebecca. They have a

speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: You have pushed it, Young Lady!
text: Pascagolua scurries off. Skeeter turns to her father...
speaker_heading: SKEETER
dialog: Daddy, what happened to
dialog: Constantine?
text: The room grows silent. Carlton looks down to his plate.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Ah...well, Constantine went to live
text: with her family. People move on,
dialog: Skeeter. But I do wish she'd
dialog: stayed down here with us.
speaker_heading: SKEETER
dialog: I don't believe you.
text: Skeeter looks to her mother who immediately busies herself

speaker_heading: SKEETER (CONT'D)
dialog: Mother, did you...fire her?
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: You wouldn't understand. Not until

dialog: 26.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKEETER
dialog: She raised me!

speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: SHE DID NOT!
text: Skeeter's eyes fill with tears...
speaker_heading: SKEETER
dialog: She worked here for twenty-nine
dialog: years.
text: Charlotte presses both hands to her stomach.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: It was a colored thing, and I've
dialog: put it behind me.

speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)

dialog: 
text: Constantine stands tall. Her skin is black as night. Her

speaker_heading: SKEETER
dialog: I'd like to write something from

dialog: I'd like to do a book of interviews

speaker_heading: AIBILEEN
dialog: You know what'd happen to me if

speaker_heading: STUART (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: HILLY

speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: So, what do you do with your time?
speaker_heading: SKEETER
dialog: I write a...a domestic maintenance

speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: You mean housekeeping?

speaker_heading: STUART (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: SKEETER
dialog: I'm sorry, but were you dropped on

speaker_heading: HILLY
dialog: Who? Is? Hungry?
text: Skeeter stands.
speaker_heading: SKEETER
dialog: Not me! A kiss from God couldn't

speaker_heading: STUART

speaker_heading: YULE MAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Would you consider givin' us a
dialog: loan? I'll...I'll work for free
dialog: until it's paid off.
speaker_heading: HILLY
dialog: That's not working for free, Yule

speaker_heading: YULE MAY
dialog: Yes, ma'am.
speaker_heading: HILLY
dialog: As a Christian, I'm going to do you

speaker_heading: MINNY
dialog: That's her.
text: Aibileen's mouth drops open at the sight of Celia's shorts

speaker_heading: MINNY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MINNY

speaker_heading: MAE MOBLEY
dialog: Mae Mo hungry, Momma.

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: She's always hungry.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: HILLY (CONT'D)
dialog: Nice to have your own, isn't it?
speaker_heading: AIBILEEN
dialog: Yes, ma'am.
speaker_heading: HILLY
dialog: Separate but equal. That's what
dialog: Ross Barnett says, and you can't
dialog: argue with the Governor.
speaker_heading: SKEETER
dialog: Not in Mississippi. Birthplace of

text: Hilly narrows her eyes at Skeeter and turns to Aibileen.
speaker_heading: HILLY
dialog: Aibileen, did you know that me and
dialog: Mister Holbrook arranged for that
dialog: bathroom? Sent the boys over and
dialog: the equipment, too.
text: Hilly stays on Aibileen, waiting for her to say something.
text: Skeeter fumes, hoping Aibileen doesn't say it.
speaker_heading: AIBILEEN
dialog: Yes, ma'am...And I thank you.
text: Hilly smiles and nods.
speaker_heading: HILLY
dialog: Well...You. Are. Welcome.

speaker_heading: AIBILEEN (V.O.)
dialog: One thing I got to say about Miss

text: Hilly kisses her son gently.
speaker_heading: AIBILEEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: And, law, do they love her back.

dialog: try and think a my sweet Treelore
dialog: and how much he loved me. That

scene_heading: INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER THAT DAY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: YULE MAY
dialog: May I get you something?
speaker_heading: SKEETER
dialog: No, thanks...
speaker_heading: (HUSHED)
dialog: Yule May, I wanted to talk to you.
text: Yule May turns off the sink faucet making sure Hilly is still
text: cackling out on the street.
speaker_heading: YULE MAY
dialog: I know what you want to ask, Miss
dialog: Skeeter. Aibileen and Minny
dialog: already did.
text: Yule May closes the kitchen door.
speaker_heading: YULE MAY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm trying to get my boys off to

speaker_heading: SKEETER
dialog: I understand.
speaker_heading: HILLY (O.C.)
dialog: What do you "understand," Skeeter?

speaker_heading: HILLY

speaker_heading: YULE MAY

speaker_heading: SKEETER
dialog: Of course not, Hilly!

speaker_heading: HILLY

dialog: 72.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKEETER
dialog: Not at all. I'm just so busy right

speaker_heading: HILLY
dialog: Skeeter...I'm sorry about your

text: Hilly holds up the Jim Crow booklet.
speaker_heading: HILLY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: SKEETER
dialog: My dad had me get that for him.
speaker_heading: HILLY
dialog: I mean, around your friends is one

speaker_heading: SKEETER
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Don't panic, but there's a very

speaker_heading: SKEETER
dialog: He's a drunken asshole, Mother.
dialog: You wouldn't like him.

scene_heading: INT. PHELAN PLANTATION - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Skeeter, Charlotte and Stuart sit in the living room.

speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Stuart, would you like a cocktail?

speaker_heading: STUART

speaker_heading: SKEETER
dialog: Who sent you? William or Hilly?
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Neither. I was rude, and I've been

speaker_heading: SKEETER
dialog: Well, I haven't. So, just go.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Now, look. I told Hilly I wasn't

speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Well! That must be it then.
speaker_heading: SKEETER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: I've never met a woman that said

speaker_heading: SKEETER
dialog: I've got plenty to say...
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Would you like to...come downtown

speaker_heading: SKEETER

speaker_heading: CELIA

speaker_heading: CELIA (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: CELIA
dialog: Hilly, I got pregnant after you and

speaker_heading: FAYE BELLE
dialog: I remember hiding with Miss Lilia
text: in a steamer trunk while Yankee

scene_heading: INT. PHELAN PLANTATION - BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Red-eyed, Skeeter enters Charlotte's room. A bowl rests on
text: the bedside table with a wet rag draped over the side.
text: Charlotte is wig free and terribly thin. Her collarbone
text: protrudes long and narrow, but her eyes are as sharp as ever.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Have you been crying? You know
dialog: that ages your skin, Dear.
speaker_heading: SKEETER
dialog: Mother, I need to talk to you about
dialog: Constantine.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Oh, Eugenia. That was so long ago.
speaker_heading: SKEETER
dialog: Well, I have to speak to her.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Now, you look. I was good to
dialog: Constantine. Oh, she talked back
dialog: plenty of times, and I put up with
dialog: it. But, Skeeter, she didn't give
dialog: me a choice...
speaker_heading: SKEETER
dialog: What...happened?

speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE (V.O.)
dialog: I was hosting a D.A.R. luncheon.
dialog: Constantine was to do the floors
dialog: that morning so they'd be dry in
dialog: time.
text: Charlotte finds Constantine mopping the foyer very slowly.
text: The effects of arthritis are apparent.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, the floors were soaking wet
dialog: when the first guest arrived.
text: A guest unnecessarily grabs a table for balance, making a
dialog: point about the damp floor...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PHELAN PLANTATION (FLASHBACK) DINING ROOM - DAY
text: Charlotte sits with twelve women at the dining table as
text: Constantine pushes the casserole cart around and begins
dialog: serving lunch.
text: As the guests sip coffee, each woman grimaces and turns to
dialog: Charlotte.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE (V.O.)
dialog: Then, she burned the coffee. She
dialog: had gotten so old, Skeeter.
text: Charlotte shoots Constantine a look. Constantine nods
text: sorrowfully. She picks up a woman's plate and begins filling
text: it with food from the cart very slowly.
text: Constantine strains to lower the plate in front of the woman.
text: Her hands tremble.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Her mishaps were becoming a daily
dialog: occurrence, and I had had it.
text: The plate tilts causing peas to pour into the woman's lap.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Watch out!
text: With that, Charlotte stands up and slaps the table with her
dialog: hand.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Get a hold of yourself,
dialog: Constantine!

dialog: herself.
dialog: 113.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: And that's when it happened.
text: Constantine wets herself.
text: Slowly the women begin realizing what's happening. The two

dialog: her.
text: Another woman rises from the table covering her mouth with a

text: Just now realizing what has happened, Constantine looks down

text: Constantine looks to Charlotte.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD (FLASHBACK) - MOMENTS LATER
text: Constantine hobbles with a cane down a gravel road still

scene_heading: INT. PHELAN PLANTATION - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Skeeter trembles. Charlotte won't look at her.
speaker_heading: SKEETER

speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: I didn't mean to.
speaker_heading: SKEETER
dialog: Why didn't you help her?
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: I was upset. I didn't know what
dialog: else to do.
speaker_heading: SKEETER
dialog: So you just threw her away? That
dialog: woman did you the biggest favor of
dialog: your life. She taught me kindness
dialog: and self respect and you just threw
text: her away like a broken appliance.
text: Charlotte starts to cry. Skeeter isn't affected.
dialog: 114.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: I didn't throw her away, Skeeter.
dialog: Your daddy went to her house the
dialog: very next day to give her her job
text: back. But she had already moved to
dialog: Chicago. Left everything behind.
speaker_heading: SKEETER
dialog: `Cause she didn't have anything
dialog: anymore. You broke her heart!
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Please don't do this to me,
dialog: Skeeter. I feel terrible. And you
dialog: have to remember, they're not like
dialog: us. They are different.
text: Charlotte gets defensive.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
dialog: And you idolized her too much! You
dialog: always have!
speaker_heading: SKEETER
dialog: I needed somebody to look up to.
text: Skeeter turns to leave.
speaker_heading: SKEETER (CONT'D)
dialog: I have to go find her. She needs
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: We finally found the address of her

dialog: Carlton up there to go get
dialog: Constantine.
text: Skeeter turns back to her mother.
speaker_heading: SKEETER
dialog: And?
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: When he got there...she was dead,
dialog: Eugenia. I'm so sorry, Honey.
text: Charlotte tries to comfort her. Skeeter rejects her mother's
dialog: hand.
speaker_heading: SKEETER
dialog: Why didn't y'all tell me all this?
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: I knew you'd blame me...when it
dialog: wasn't my fault. It just happened,
dialog: and it was so unfortunate. I'm
dialog: sorry, Eugenia.
speaker_heading: SKEETER
dialog: When did she die? How long had she

speaker_heading: AIBILEEN (V.O.)

speaker_heading: MINNY
dialog: Greens got just the right amount a

speaker_heading: MINNY
dialog: A course I's happy. You happy too.
dialog: Big house, big yard, good husband.
speaker_heading: CELIA

speaker_heading: STUART (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: You know, Hilly. If I didn't know

speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE

text: Charlotte reaches down and pulls up her copy of "The Help".
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
