text: It is 1956. Saltwood Castle, the family home of the Clark
text: family, looms over the landscape, framed by the setting
text: sun. It is majestic, an Englishman's dream of a home,
text: complete with turrets and even a moat. There is a feeling
text: of timeless beauty and stability about the scene, something

text: COLIN bounds up the stairs into the Library.

scene_heading: 3B INT. SALTWOOD CASTLE. LIBRARY. DAY. 3B
text: As COLIN enters, he sees SIR KENNETH CLARK, standing in front
text: of a painting on an easel by the Italian Baroque painter,
text: Annibale Carracci. He has two STUDENTS with him, a man and a
text: woman in their early 20s, and is in mid-description of the
dialog: painting.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: ... and this is one of Carracci's
dialog: earlier works and one is able to
dialog: see the emergence of his now famous
text: Baroque style, which is clearly
dialog: rooted in the tradition of high
dialog: renaissance and antiquity...
text: COLIN pauses briefly and hurries towards them. Throughout the
text: scene there is a sense of his urgency and desire to go. The
text: whole thing should be played at breakneck pace. KENNETH beams
dialog: affectionately.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Colin! Come in. Have you met James
dialog: and Anna? Two very brilliant
dialog: pupils.
text: He has the avuncular air of a benign academic, affable and a
text: little eccentric. COLIN smiles hurriedly at the students, no
dialog: time to waste.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: I'm leaving for London now, Pa.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Ah, yes. Well, bon chance, dear
dialog: boy...
text: He puts a friendly arm around COLIN's shoulder and starts to
text: walk him back to the door.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: I can always get you a research
dialog: position at the V&amp;A when you've
dialog: grown up a bit and got this film
dialog: idea out of your system...
text: COLIN's smiles but before he can reply JANE CLARK whirls into
text: the room, a ball of energy, talking nineteen to the dozen.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Kenneth, you might have told Cook
dialog: we were another two for dinner.
dialog: What is everyone supposed to eat?
dialog: Cabbage soup? Oh, Colin, darling,
dialog: there you are...
text: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 2A.
dialog: 
text: She looks wonderful in a good quality but elderly dress,
text: eccentrically combined with gardening attire, her mind on a
text: dozen things at once.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: I'm off now, Mama.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Off?
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: My job interview, remember..?

dialog: Can't you stay for dinner? There's
dialog: nothing to eat but I'm sure the
dialog: conversation will be charming.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: I don't want to be late in the
dialog: morning.
text: As COLIN hurries after JANE he is nearly run down by an
text: elderly GARDENER with a lawn mower, and has to take lightning
text: evasive action. JANE doesn't notice.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I'm sure they won't mind. You'll be
dialog: a famous film director in no time.
dialog: I know your father's put in a word.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: I wish he hadn't done that. I can
dialog: manage on my own.
text: She stops so abruptly he nearly slams into her. JANE looks
text: around the garden with a frown.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I have to watch Jenkins like a
text: hawk. One more of his murderous
dialog: prunings and we'll lose the tea
dialog: roses for ever.

text: The sun is setting, casting a golden glow over the castle.
text: COLIN and JANE emerge from the front door, COLIN pauses in
text: the driveway and dumps his bag in the back of his old but
text: racy MG Sports car. Only now does JANE really turn her
text: attention fully to him for the first time.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Now go and have a lovely time,
dialog: darling. We're always here when
dialog: you're ready to talk your future.
text: COLIN wants to protest but before he can get the words out
text: JANE sees a YOUNG GARDENER walking at the side of the house
text: with a wheel barrow. Her face lights up.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Mullins! Be an angel - find Cook
dialog: and ask her how many pork chops we
dialog: need for tonight. Then bring the
dialog: car round. I must get to the
text: village before the shop shuts...
text: She dashes away after the GARDENER, turning back as an
text: afterthought to blow a kiss at COLIN as she goes.
text: COLIN smiles, then pauses for a moment to look at the house.
dialog: We can sense both his affection for it but more pressingly
dialog: his need to get away.
text: He gets in, puts the car in gear and the Bristol pulls out of
text: the drive and across the moat. In the last rays of the sun,
text: the countryside looks magical, but Colin only has eyes for
text: the road ahead.

text: raincoats stream from the tube stations.
text: COLIN pushes his way through the early morning crowds in
text: Piccadilly. This is his patch; he is very much at home
text: here, negotiating the busy streets with ease. As he passes

speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: You're not in Mr. Perceval's
dialog: diary.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Larry told me to come.

speaker_heading: PERCEVAL
speaker_heading: (OFF)
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: VANESSA

speaker_heading: PERCEVAL
dialog: Well, what do you want?

dialog: A job on your Marilyn Monroe

dialog: Oh really, what as?
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: I want to work on the production

speaker_heading: PERCEVAL
dialog: There are no jobs yet. We don't

speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: May I wait?
speaker_heading: PERCEVAL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Until there's a job.
speaker_heading: PERCEVAL
dialog: For eight weeks?

speaker_heading: PERCEVAL
dialog: There are no jobs.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: I'll come back tomorrow morning.

text: COLIN is back in his place at 8.30 sharp the next morning.
text: PERCEVAL gives him a grim stare as he goes through to his
text: office. VANESSA glances up from her typewriter. He meets her
text: eye optimistically but she ignores him.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 13 INT. 144 PICCADILLY. RECEPTION AREA. DAY. 13
text: The clock ticks around with agonising slowness to 11.00.
text: VANESSA finally gives Colin a pitying look.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Are you going to sit there all
dialog: day?
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: If I have to.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: You're very determined.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: I'd do anything to be in the film

speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Anything?

text: She gives COLIN a sly look.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: You can answer the telephone while

speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Vanessa asked me to...
speaker_heading: PERCEVAL
dialog: Oh, did she? Why didn't you put
dialog: that call through?
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: There didn't seem any need to
dialog: bother you. But if you want me to

text: PERCEVAL looks at him grudgingly.
speaker_heading: PERCEVAL
dialog: Use your judgement.
text: He hesitates and looks back.
speaker_heading: PERCEVAL (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: PERCEVAL
dialog: Am I supposed to be impressed?
dialog: Did Mummy and Daddy help? Don't

text: A new morning. COLIN perches restlessly on the sofa.
text: Despite his modest triumph he is back where he started. The
text: seconds pass in dull silence. He is beginning to think his
dialog: campaign will fail. But then, in a heartbeat, everything
dialog: changes.
text: He looks up in surprise as the door bursts open and SIR
text: LAURENCE OLIVIER strides in with his wife VIVIEN LEIGH on
text: his arm.
text: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 10.
dialog: 
text: At the age of 49 SIR LAURENCE OLIVIER is at the peak of his
text: fame. He is handsome and charismatic, and VIVIEN is
dialog: scarcely less extraordinary. The Gone With The Wind star
text: remains classically lovely, flirtatious and captivating.
text: Individually they are charismatic enough, but together they
text: are electrifying, seeming to charge the air around them
dialog: with the power of their personalities, galvanising anyone
text: who comes into contact with them.
text: VANESSA leaps to her feet and PERCEVAL hurries to greet
text: them as COLIN stands up uncertainly. OLIVIER is all amiable
text: bluster and bonhomie.
speaker_heading: OLIVIER
dialog: Do you know, Hughie, it is simply
dialog: impossible to get Marilyn Monroe on
dialog: the telephone? The darling girl
text: spends the entire day asleep. But
dialog: great beauty has its way...
text: He laughs, but then notices VIVIEN's less than enthusiastic
text: response. Seeking refuge in some distraction he notices
text: COLIN hovering by the sofa.
speaker_heading: OLIVIER (CONT'D)
dialog: Hello, boy... remind me?
text: He smiles vaguely and glances at VIVIEN for help.
speaker_heading: VIVIEN
dialog: You remember Colin, darling. You
dialog: met him at the Clarks' party.
speaker_heading: OLIVIER
speaker_heading: (NO IDEA)
dialog: Of course. What are you doing
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: You said there might be a job on
dialog: your film.
text: OLIVIER has no recollection of this and fumbles in his
text: pockets to cover his confusion, bringing out a packet of
text: cigarettes and offering them to COLIN with breezy charm.
speaker_heading: OLIVIER
dialog: Have a cigarette. Keep the pack.
text: He turns quickly to PERCEVAL.
text: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 11.

speaker_heading: OLIVIER (CONT'D)
dialog: There won't be any film unless
dialog: Miss Monroe gets her splendid
text: posterior out of bed.
speaker_heading: PERCEVAL
dialog: The House Committee are
dialog: threatening to withhold Miller's
dialog: passport. They say he's a
dialog: communist. No Arthur, no Marilyn.
speaker_heading: OLIVIER
dialog: I'll have a word with the
dialog: American ambassador. I'm taking
dialog: him to see Vivien in South Sea
dialog: Bubble on Thursday... now, tell
dialog: me, Hughie, are Terry's rewrites
dialog: in?
text: He puts an arm around PERCEVAL's shoulders and they
text: disappear together into Perceval's office.
text: VIVIEN lingers behind, smiling radiantly at COLIN who looks
text: dumbly at the packet of cigarettes in his hand. He now sees
text: they are called "Oliviers". VIVIEN wrinkles her nose in
dialog: amusement.
speaker_heading: VIVIEN
dialog: They named them after Larry. The
dialog: first actor since Du Maurier to
dialog: have his own brand and they pay
dialog: him an absolute fortune. (Pause)
dialog: I'm afraid they're rather
text: ghastly.
text: She cups Colin's cheeks with her hands and studies him in
text: mock awe.
speaker_heading: VIVIEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Isn't he gorgeous, Vanessa?
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: I suppose he's all right.
text: VIVIEN's eyes sparkle. OLIVIER emerges from the office with a
text: handful of script pages and VIVIEN looks at him slyly,
dialog: getting her own back for his tactless over-praise of
text: Marilyn's charms as she strokes COLIN's cheek.
text: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 12.

speaker_heading: VIVIEN
speaker_heading: (TO COLIN)
dialog: Let's elope together and have the

dialog: but then, who'd look after my
dialog: poor Larry?
text: Olivier glances over with a faint look of exasperation.
text: VIVIEN winks at COLIN and takes her husband's arm.
speaker_heading: VIVIEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Now, darling, you must do
dialog: something for Colin. You
dialog: absolutely promised.
text: OLIVIER looks hunted. There is no way out. He glances back
text: at PERCEVAL as he comes in.
speaker_heading: OLIVIER
dialog: Let's try to find him something
dialog: to do, Hughie.
text: COLIN grins in triumph. VIVIEN smiles at him.
speaker_heading: VIVIEN
dialog: You will take care of my precious
dialog: Larrykins, won't you?
text: She flirtatiously offers up her cheek for COLIN to kiss.

dialog: 20
text: COLIN knocks and walks into Perceval's office, carrying a
text: tray with tea and a plate of biscuits. The blinds are closed
text: and a 16mm projector is running; silent images play on a fold-
text: up screen in the corner of the room.
text: Framed in the light of the projector are PERCEVAL and the
text: film's lighting cameraman JACK CARDIFF. They take no notice
dialog: of Colin.
text: He looks up at the screen. The two men are watching make-up,
text: hair and wardrobe tests for the film. MARILYN MONROE in
dialog: character as Elsie Marina.
text: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 12A.
dialog: 
text: The film shows Marilyn looking sweet and pretty, chatting
text: silently to someone just off camera, mugging playfully in
text: costume, larking about with her hair - and then, when she
text: wants to, turning on her full film star wattage and looking
dialog: wonderful, every inch the beautiful icon.
text: It is an intimate glimpse of her at work. Colin watches,
text: fascinated, completely forgetting why he's there, still
dialog: holding the tray -
speaker_heading: PERCEVAL
speaker_heading: (TO CARDIFF)
dialog: Larry says he particularly likes
text: this dress. She looks radiant.
speaker_heading: CARDIFF
dialog: Exactly - we need to tone her down
dialog: a bit.
speaker_heading: PERCEVAL
dialog: How the hell do you tone down
dialog: Marilyn Monroe?!
text: COLIN laughs. He immediately regrets it. Both men turn to
text: look at him. PERCEVAL turns off the projector and gazes at
text: him stonily.
speaker_heading: PERCEVAL
dialog: Marilyn Monroe's publicist is
text: flying in tomorrow. He wants to see
dialog: the house she'll be staying in.
dialog: Find something suitable.
text: COLIN nods eagerly, anxious to get out. He is already at the
text: door when PERCEVAL barks at him again.
speaker_heading: PERCEVAL
dialog: And leave the bloody tea.
text: COLIN had forgotten the tray. He blushes furiously, puts it
text: down and hurries out.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 21 EXT. COUNTRY ROAD. DAY. 21
text: COLIN has a map spread out on the bonnet of his Bristol
text: sports car. He finds Pinewood Studios then draws a ring
text: around its circumference. He taps his pencil thoughtfully
text: as he lights a cigarette - one of the branded pack that

speaker_heading: COTES-PREEDY
dialog: Out of the question. I can't have
dialog: a lot of awful film people
text: tramping through the house in

speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: We'd pay a hundred pounds per
dialog: week for 18 weeks.
speaker_heading: COTES-PREEDY
dialog: My wife would never agree.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: That's a pity. I'll have to tell

speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: When you asked me to find a house

speaker_heading: PERCEVAL

speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: I thought someone else on the

speaker_heading: PERCEVAL

speaker_heading: ORTON

speaker_heading: ORTON (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: ORTON

text: COLIN stands aghast. He is staying in a grim little room
text: above the noisy saloon bar. The wallpaper is peeling, the
text: furniture is ancient and the whole place reeks of damp.
text: Dirty net curtains flutter in the window. He puts his bag
text: on the bed and sits down. The mattress sags pitifully. He
text: looks down and finds a stained and yellowing chamber pot
text: under the bed. He slides it back with a look of revulsion.

scene_heading: 46 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 46
text: The principal cast of The Sleeping Prince, as it was still
text: known at the time, assemble on the sound stage amongst the
text: half-finished set. They chat and smoke, their scripts in
text: their hands. OLIVIER stands in their midst, very much first
text: amongst equals. One chair sits conspicuously unoccupied.
text: DAME SYBIL THORNDIKE (74), severe-looking but kindly, very
text: much the grand dame of the gathering, smiles cheerfully.
text: RICHARD WATTIS leans over to her with a cheerful grin.
speaker_heading: WATTIS
dialog: What a wonderful adventure, Dame

scene_heading: SYBIL THORNDIKE

speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Miss Monroe?
text: The door opens sharply and a small, bohemian looking woman
text: in her 50s stands staring at him. This is PAULA STRASBERG.
speaker_heading: COLIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Sir Laurence sends his
dialog: compliments. He's ready for the
speaker_heading: READTHROUGH
text: He glances beyond PAULA to where MARILYN sits by the
text: mirror, her reflection framed in the lights. She wears
text: little or no make-up. PAULA looks at him sharply.
speaker_heading: PAULA
dialog: But Marilyn is not ready. She's
dialog: preparing.
text: MARILYN glances up at COLIN in the mirror and smiles with

speaker_heading: OLIVIER

dialog: is so excited to meet you...
text: He gestures to the company.
speaker_heading: OLIVIER (CONT'D)
dialog: Let us begin. Do sit down,
dialog: please...
text: SYBIL THORNDIKE looks sweetly at MARILYN from across the

scene_heading: SYBIL THORNDIKE
dialog: How lovely you are. Here, I kept a
dialog: place for you.
text: PAULA bursts forward, steering Marilyn away instead to an

text: looks at RICHARD WATTIS, the actor occupying the seat next to
text: the empty one.
speaker_heading: PAULA
dialog: I have to be next to Marilyn!

scene_heading: SYBIL THORNDIKE
speaker_heading: (TO MARILYN)
dialog: Don't worry, dear, we won't bite.

speaker_heading: PAULA
dialog: She likes me by her side.
scene_heading: SYBIL THORNDIKE
dialog: What a good idea! I wish we could

dialog: the first day at school, isn't it?
text: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 30.
dialog: 
text: She smiles kindly at MARILYN who smiles back tentatively from
text: behind her dark glasses. He smiles with considerable charm as
text: he makes his opening speech of welcome.
speaker_heading: OLIVIER
dialog: Welcome dear Marilyn, to our
dialog: little fraternity. (Pause, looks
dialog: around) We may seem a little
dialog: strange and quaint to you at
dialog: first, but I hope that in time
dialog: you may come to find your method
dialog: in our madness.
text: Pleased with his over-contrived rhetorical flourish, he
text: gives Paula a pointed look. She glowers back, obscurely
text: sensing that she has been insulted in some way. MARILYN
text: also looks up in confusion at Olivier's well intentioned
dialog: but clumsy joke.
text: Oblivious to her reaction, he opens his script with a
dialog: sentimental flourish.
speaker_heading: OLIVIER (CONT'D)
dialog: So. My very noble and approv'd
dialog: good masters, let us now embark
dialog: on our great voyage of discovery
dialog: together. (Pause) With boldness
dialog: and (we pray) good fortune, may
dialog: we strive to create a work of art
dialog: that, led by your good graces,
dialog: will be cherished as long as
dialog: motion pictures may be
dialog: remembered.
text: He is momentarily close to tears. WATTIS rolls his eyes
text: discreetly, earning a grin from the actor PAUL HARDWICK.
text: There is a rustle of pages and a few coughs, a mood of

speaker_heading: OLIVIER (AS REGENT)
dialog: "Were you surprised to get my

speaker_heading: MARILYN (AS ELSIE)
dialog: "I'll say I was surprised. I was

speaker_heading: OLIVIER (AS REGENT)
dialog: "oh but of course I meant you. I

text: MARILYN drops out of character with a sweet, nervous smile.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: Gee, Mister Sir, I could listen

text: There are private grins amongst the actors. OLIVIER smiles
dialog: kindly.
speaker_heading: OLIVIER

speaker_heading: OLIVIER (AS REGENT)
dialog: "Oh, no, no, no not Maisie

text: PAULA leans across, mounting a whispered running commentary
text: in Marilyn's ear as OLIVIER speaks.
speaker_heading: PAULA
dialog: Remember why you're in the
dialog: embassy, Marilyn. What does the
dialog: Grand Duke want from Elsie? She
dialog: thought there were going to be a

dialog: 
text: OLIVIER tries to continue but is yet again brought up short
text: by PAULA's passionate whispering.
speaker_heading: PAULA
dialog: Locate the experience, Marilyn.
dialog: Look for the memory that helps
dialog: you. Remember when you went to
dialog: that party at Chaplin's house and
dialog: you were the only guest? How did
dialog: that make you feel?
text: This time OLIVIER stares at PAULA.
speaker_heading: OLIVIER
dialog: It is only a readthrough, Paula.
speaker_heading: PAULA
dialog: Marilyn has to begin finding the

speaker_heading: OLIVIER
text: The character is on the page.
speaker_heading: PAULA
dialog: The words, maybe. Not the
dialog: character.
text: RICHARD WATTIS whispers to PAUL HARDWICK.
speaker_heading: WATTIS
dialog: She's half cut!

scene_heading: 51 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 51

speaker_heading: OLIVIER

speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Marilyn wants Paula.
speaker_heading: OLIVIER
dialog: Why? She's got me!
speaker_heading: MILTON

speaker_heading: LUCY

speaker_heading: COLIN

scene_heading: SYBIL THORNDIKE

speaker_heading: OLIVIER

text: The door finally opens and MARILYN emerges, with PAULA on
text: one side and MILTON on the other. In her figure-hugging
text: shimmering white sheath of a dress she is ravishingly
text: beautiful. Her hair is like a halo of light around her
text: head. No one can take their eyes off her. Slowly, all work
text: on the set stops. MARILYN walks to the set, acutely aware
dialog: of the scrutiny of the crew.
text: She smiles nervously, then suddenly hesitates, feeling the

speaker_heading: TREVOR

speaker_heading: COLIN

speaker_heading: TREVOR (CONT'D)

text: Half the crew immediately down tools. COLIN looks on in
text: horror. SYBIL THORNDIKE frowns in reproach.
scene_heading: SYBIL THORNDIKE

speaker_heading: TREVOR

dialog: He's not in the union. (Pause, to

text: COLIN stares at him, frozen.
speaker_heading: TREVOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Put the chair down now!
text: COLIN drops it as though it was on fire. It clatters to the
text: stage. SYBIL THORNDIKE bears down on TREVOR majestically.
scene_heading: SYBIL THORNDIKE
dialog: I rather think you've made your
dialog: point. Solidarity is the
dialog: important thing here. When unions
dialog: fall out, it's only management
dialog: that benefits.

text: magnanimously.
speaker_heading: TREVOR
speaker_heading: (TO COLIN)
dialog: If I see you doing a NATTKE job

speaker_heading: TREVOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Dave, Dame Sybil needs a chair.

speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: He was angry with me, I could

speaker_heading: PAULA
dialog: You were great. You are a great,
dialog: great actress. All my life I have
dialog: prayed for a great actress I
dialog: could help and guide.
text: She stops abruptly and gets down on her knees in the
text: corridor in front of Marilyn. COLIN stops awkwardly, his
dialog: path blocked.
speaker_heading: PAULA (CONT'D)
dialog: Like this. I prayed to God on my
dialog: knees. And he has given me you.
dialog: You are that great actress,
dialog: Marilyn.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: Come on, Paula, get up.
speaker_heading: PAULA
dialog: Not until you admit you were

speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: Oh, okay. I guess I was.
text: COLIN glances at her, seeing his chance to help.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: You really were very good, Miss

scene_heading: 64 INT. CAFE DE PARIS. LONDON. NIGHT. 64
text: The mood in the Club is cosmopolitan, lively but elegant.
text: Rows of small tables are arranged around the stage, a few
text: young couples are dancing to a jazz trio playing an
text: exuberant, upbeat number. The music comes to an end and
text: the couples return to their tables, COLIN and LUCY among
text: them. There is champagne on the table, COLIN pours them

speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Are you sure you can afford all
dialog: this?
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Oh, it's all right.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: It must be costing a week's wages.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: It's worth it.
text: LUCY can't help being charmed.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: You're not the average third, are
dialog: you? Most of them would be happy
text: with a swift half and a grope in
text: the pub car park.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: I'm not living off my parents, if
dialog: that's what you mean. I want to
dialog: make my own way, no matter what.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: By making eyes at Vivien Leigh?
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Who told you that?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Word gets around.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Vivien's a friend of my father's.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: So there's nothing in it? You and
dialog: Vivien?
text: He smiles mysteriously and leans in to kiss her. She avoids
text: him coolly.
speaker_heading: LUCY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm not that easy.
text: The WAITER approaches with a bill on a silver salver and
text: offers him a pen.
text: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 43A.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: You'll be signing on your father's

text: COLIN blushes violently.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Certainly not. I settle my own

text: with a teasing smile.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: I was always going to pay, you
dialog: know.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Of course you were.
text: He looks at her, but there is no hint of mockery in her smile
text: and he is grateful.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Do you think Marilyn is beautiful?
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Not compared to you.
text: LUCY laughs, COLIN looks hurt.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: You don't have to try so hard to be
dialog: charming. You're nice enough as it
dialog: is. Well, you could be.

speaker_heading: LUCY (CONT'D)
dialog: You know Marilyn's really still
dialog: in love with Joe DiMaggio?
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: So they say.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: She married Miller on the
dialog: rebound. The papers are calling
dialog: them "The Hourglass and the
dialog: Egghead".
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Which one is which?

scene_heading: 65 EXT. LUCY'S HOUSE. SUBURBS. NIGHT. 65
text: Colin's Bristol is drawn up in a quiet suburban road lined

speaker_heading: LUCY
text: Wait a while, crocodile.
speaker_heading: COLIN

speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Maybe.
text: She hears heavy footsteps in the bedroom above.
speaker_heading: LUCY (CONT'D)
dialog: That's my dad.
text: She gives Colin a swift peck on the cheek as she tidies
text: herself. A moment later the door opens and Lucy's father, MR.
text: ARMSTRONG comes in, wearing his dressing gown over pyjamas.
text: He glances at COLIN with a suspicious smile as he looks at
dialog: his daughter.
speaker_heading: MR. ARMSTRONG
dialog: Time to be thinking about bed,
dialog: darling. Early start tomorrow.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Sorry, Daddy. We were just going

text: and stands up.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Yes, I should be off. Colin Clark.
dialog: Pleased to meet you, Mr. Armstrong.
text: He offers the surprised MR. ARMSTRONG a confident handshake.
speaker_heading: COLIN (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MR. ARMSTRONG
dialog: Do you know this part of the world?
speaker_heading: COLIN
speaker_heading: (THROWN)
dialog: Umm... not really. My family are

scene_heading: 65B EXT. LUCY'S HOUSE. SUBURBS. NIGHT. 65B
text: As he walks down the path, COLIN pauses. He looks around at
text: the uniform semi-detached houses all around him. He is
text: uncomfortable here, so far from the glamorous world of his
dialog: parents or Pinewood studios. He has a strong sense that he

speaker_heading: COLIN

speaker_heading: MILTON

speaker_heading: OLIVIER

speaker_heading: OLIVIER (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: This is Marilyn you're talking
dialog: about.
text: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 47.
dialog: 
text: OLIVIER scowls at COLIN, who gives him a cigarette. MARILYN
text: finally emerges with PAULA at her elbow. OLIVIER advances
text: on her, his anger simmering.
speaker_heading: OLIVIER
dialog: Marilyn, darling you are an
dialog: angel, and I kiss the hem of your
dialog: garment, but why can't you get
dialog: here on time for the love of
dialog: fuck?
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: Oh... you have that word in
dialog: England too?
text: She looks at him in surprise. She looks sedated, not quite
text: there. PAULA leaps protectively to her defence.
speaker_heading: PAULA
text: Marilyn has to prepare properly.
dialog: She has to find in herself all
text: that lies under the surface.
dialog: Acting isn't just a case of
dialog: putting on a costume or some
text: ludicrous false nose.
text: OLIVIER gives her a freezing look then takes Marilyn's
text: hand, leading her forward like a child.
speaker_heading: OLIVIER

scene_heading: SYBIL THORNDIKE

dialog: you do. It is a rare gift.
text: She looks sharply at OLIVIER.
speaker_heading: SYBIL THORNDIKE (cont'd)
dialog: This poor girl hasn't had your
text: years of experience. She is in a
dialog: strange country, acting a strange

dialog: 
scene_heading: 69 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. VIEWING THEATRE. DAY. 69
scene_heading: OLIVIER, MILTON, PERCEVAL, ORTON and the editor JACK HARRIS
text: watch rushes. COLIN lurks about unnoticed at the back. They
text: watch one of OLIVIER's speeches (from the " The Coconut
dialog: Girl" sequence we saw filming in Scenes 61 and 62). He is
text: dry and clipped, every take precise and professional. It is
text: an effective but theatrical performance.
text: MARILYN sneaks in with ARTHUR MILLER. They sit in the back
text: row watching her performance from the same scene. She
text: fluffs take after take, gets her words wrong and pauses,
text: looking dazed. COLIN notices her clutching MILLER's hand
text: tightly. But finally a good take comes up. She is charming
text: and natural and her performance suddenly makes OLIVIER's
text: look stiff and clumsy. MILLER smiles in relief and
text: reassurance.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: That one's pretty damn good. You
text: knocked it out of the park.
text: MARILYN glows at his praise.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: When Marilyn gets it right you
dialog: just don't want to look at anyone
dialog: else.
text: OLIVIER frowns. For all his greatness as an actor he will
dialog: never be a film star like the maddeningly instinctive
text: Marilyn. And the injustice of it is like a stab through his
dialog: heart.
text: At the back COLIN only has eyes for the screen. He watches
text: MARILYN's image, enthralled. Until now he has taken Marilyn
text: entirely at Olivier's valuation, but as he watches her on
text: screen he begins to see things differently.
text: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 49.

text: He looks self-conscious as they both turn to stare at him.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: The kid's right. She could use

speaker_heading: OLIVIER
dialog: I believe it's traditional for
dialog: the producer of the film to watch

speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Your script...
speaker_heading: MARILYN

speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Marilyn's a star. Stars don't

speaker_heading: PASSER-BY
dialog: It's Marilyn Monroe!
text: MARILYN gives him a radiant smile and within seconds is

text: MARILYN is quickly hemmed in by the heaving mob. To begin
text: with she enjoys it, smiling and posing happily for the

speaker_heading: OLIVIER
dialog: Cut. What's the matter now?
text: He takes her arm and whisks her away to the side of the

text: with a honeyed tone.
speaker_heading: OLIVIER (CONT'D)
dialog: Forgive me, Marilyn. This is my
dialog: failure, not yours. Tell me how I

speaker_heading: OLIVIER

speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: I can't find her. She's not

speaker_heading: OLIVIER
dialog: But you have her precisely, you
dialog: know her inside out. I'm in awe of
dialog: your gift. We all are.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: She's not real.
speaker_heading: OLIVIER
dialog: Why not simply rely on your natural
dialog: talents?
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: Are you saying I don't need to
dialog: act?
text: OLIVIER is bewildered by her inability to appreciate her
text: own natural talent - as he sees it. He looks at her in
text: genuine anguish.
speaker_heading: OLIVIER
dialog: Marilyn, you are the most
text: attractive woman in the world.
dialog: I'm simply suggesting you be
dialog: yourself.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
speaker_heading: (SHOUTS)
dialog: I don't want to be myself!
dialog: (Pause) I want to be an actress
text: playing a character.
speaker_heading: OLIVIER
dialog: (Trying to be helpful)
dialog: All you have to do, dear Marilyn,
dialog: is be sexy. Isn't that what you
dialog: do?
text: MARILYN flinches as though slapped. Tension ripples through
text: the set. COLIN watches in dismay.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: I want Lee.
speaker_heading: OLIVIER
dialog: You've already got Paula, for
dialog: heaven's sake. I'm the director.

speaker_heading: MARILYN

speaker_heading: DAY.

dialog: not a teacher. Her only talent is
text: buttering up Marilyn.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: It would be worse if she wasn't
dialog: around.
speaker_heading: OLIVIER
dialog: You know what would make Marilyn
dialog: Monroe a real actor? A season in
dialog: rep. They wouldn't stand for this
dialog: kind of nonsense at the
dialog: Hippodrome in Eastbourne.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: You have to be patient with her.
speaker_heading: OLIVIER
dialog: Trying to teach Marilyn how to
dialog: act is like teaching Urdu to a
dialog: badger.
text: MILTON gives him a look but says nothing. Instead he picks
text: up his bag and opens it. It is stuffed with bottles of
text: pills. He takes one of them, checks the label and puts it
text: in his pocket.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: I better go see her. She'll need
text: something to help her calm down.
text: COLIN holds the door for him as he goes out.
speaker_heading: OLIVIER
dialog: (After a second)
text: Pills to sleep, pills to wake up.
text: Pills to calm her down, pills to
dialog: give her energy. No wonder she's
text: permanently ten feet underwater.
text: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 59.
dialog: 
text: COLIN looks at him tentatively.
speaker_heading: COLIN
text: Maybe she's scared.
speaker_heading: OLIVIER
dialog: We're all scared. It's part of
dialog: being an actor.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: But you have the training to deal
dialog: with it.
text: OLIVIER turns from the mirror to survey him.
speaker_heading: OLIVIER
dialog: I wouldn't buy the little girl
dialog: lost act if I were you. Though
dialog: heaven knows it's tempting.
text: He sighs wistfully.
speaker_heading: OLIVIER (CONT'D)
dialog: And I think Marilyn knows exactly
dialog: what she's doing.
text: COLIN isn't so sure but wisely holds his tongue.
speaker_heading: OLIVIER (CONT'D)
dialog: You better get over to Parkside
dialog: and make sure the poor girl's all

speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: Help yourself. They can spare it.

speaker_heading: ROGER (CONT'D)
dialog: They like to keep her doped up.

speaker_heading: COLIN

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: 84 INT. PARKSIDE HOUSE. UPSTAIRS HALL. NIGHT. 84
text: COLIN, a little drunk, creeps out of the toilet. The narrow
text: strip of light from the door disappears, leaving the hall
text: in darkness. COLIN inches forward uncertainly.
text: He stops, waiting for his eyes to adjust. The house is
text: totally silent. Then, just as he is about to move, he hears
dialog: something.
text: Breathing, very close by. Faint but unmistakable. Shallow
text: breaths, like sighs.
text: COLIN is paralysed.
dialog: A beat, then -
text: A door is flung open along the hall and light floods into
dialog: the corridor.
text: MARILYN is sitting on the carpet leaning against the wall
text: only a few feet away from Colin. She is wrapped in a pink
text: bed-cover and stares directly at him, her expression blank
text: and sedated. By her side is an open spiral bound notebook,
text: its pages closely crammed with handwriting.
speaker_heading: MILLER
speaker_heading: (OFF)
dialog: Marilyn. Come back to bed. It's
dialog: not what you think.
text: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 61.
dialog: 
text: She stares at COLIN. It is not even clear she knows he is
text: there. COLIN gazes back at her, paralysed. MILLER's voice
text: comes again, flat and tired.
speaker_heading: MILLER (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (OFF)
dialog: It's just a few ideas. Writer's
dialog: stuff. (Pause) Bring back my book
dialog: and let's get some sleep.
text: Finally MARILYN stirs and closes the notebook. Holding it
text: to her breast and clutching the cover around her shoulders
text: she gets up and goes into the bedroom, closing the door.

speaker_heading: OLIVIER
text: It's nearly lunch time.
speaker_heading: MILTON
text: She isn't feeling the part.
speaker_heading: OLIVIER
dialog: It's a light comedy. How much

speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Give her a few minutes...
speaker_heading: OLIVIER

speaker_heading: MILTON

speaker_heading: PAULA
dialog: It's Colin.
text: COLIN waits a moment then PAULA opens the door wider.
speaker_heading: PAULA (CONT'D) (cont'd)

text: pause. She sighs softly.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: How old are you?
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: 24. (Pause) Nearly
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: You remind us of the young king in

dialog: innocent.
speaker_heading: COLIN
speaker_heading: (WOUNDED)
dialog: I'm not innocent.
text: She turns her head and her beautiful face comes fully into

speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: What's your job on this picture?
text: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 62A.

speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: I'm the third assistant director.
dialog: Just a gopher really. Go for

speaker_heading: MARILYN

speaker_heading: MARILYN (CONT'D)
dialog: What were you doing in my house
dialog: last night? Did he send you?
text: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 63.
dialog: 
text: COLIN hesitates. It seems pointless to deny it.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: He was worried about you.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: Are you spying on me?
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: No! Of course not. Why would
dialog: anyone spy on you?
text: She sighs, and looks away.
speaker_heading: COLIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you all right, Miss Monroe?
text: He waits hesitantly, but she seems to have drifted off. But
text: then, suddenly, she turns back to him, her eyes huge.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: Colin? Whose side are you on?
text: COLIN stares at her. She looks utterly beautiful and
text: vulnerable in the shadowy light. There is only one answer
dialog: anyone could give.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Yours, Miss Monroe.
text: She rewards him with a brilliant smile, her whole face
text: lighting up.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: Call me Marilyn.
text: He is suddenly overwhelmed by a rush of sympathy. She looks

scene_heading: 89 EXT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. DAY. 89

speaker_heading: WATTIS
dialog: Marilyn's got a new boyfriend.
dialog: Larry will get jealous.
speaker_heading: HARDWICK
dialog: You can say that again.
text: He gives a camp laugh. COLIN tries to shrug it off with a

speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Nothing happened.
text: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 63A.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTIS
dialog: You were in there for ten minutes
dialog: at least. Plenty of time for a

dialog: 
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Paula was with us the whole time.
speaker_heading: WATTIS

scene_heading: 90 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 90
text: MARILYN is finally back on the set, filming a solo dance
text: routine. Released from the need to remember any words she
text: takes refuge in the physical activity, undulating sexily in
text: her tight white dress in a performance which is gawky,
text: mildly silly and charming all at the same time.
text: The dance is deliberately a little amateurish. Elsie Marina
text: isn't meant to be any sort of superstar. But she radiates
text: joy and innocence and sheer happiness in the dance, and
text: MARILYN captures all this perfectly. Within the scene the
text: actor JEREMY SPENSER, playing Nicky, watches from the
dialog: doorway.
text: Everyone watches silently from behind the camera. No one
text: can look away, least of all COLIN. It feels like one purely
text: joyful moment in the agony the film has become, and Marilyn

text: MILLER leans forward, holding his pipe but not smoking it.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: I dreamed last night I could hear
dialog: singing. And then I realised it
dialog: wasn't a dream. There was a male

dialog: under our window. At two in the

dialog: show.
text: OLIVIER smiles but MILLER looks dazed.
speaker_heading: MILLER (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: (After a moment)
dialog: I can't help her. (Pause) You

dialog: Sleep. It's what she lives for.
dialog: Sleep is her demon.
text: He pauses for a second.
speaker_heading: MILLER (CONT'D)
dialog: I've disappointed her.
text: OLIVIER looks at him. MILLER shakes his head.
speaker_heading: MILLER (CONT'D)
dialog: She thought I could smash all her
dialog: insecurities with one magical
dialog: stroke. That I could make her a
dialog: new person.
text: He pauses for a second, weighing every word carefully.
speaker_heading: MILLER (CONT'D)
dialog: She wants me to protect her but I
dialog: can't. I can't even protect
dialog: myself. (Pause) She read some
dialog: notes I made. They were nothing.
dialog: Just a few ideas.
speaker_heading: OLIVIER
dialog: About her?
text: He looks up and nods slowly.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: She took them the wrong way.

speaker_heading: OLIVIER

speaker_heading: VIVIEN

speaker_heading: ORTON

speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: I'm doing my best...

speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: Oh, but everyone says you were a

speaker_heading: VIVIEN
dialog: But I'm too old to play her in
dialog: the film. Larry was quite brutal
dialog: about that. You see, the truth is
dialog: all that matters to him. That's
dialog: why we all admire him so very
dialog: much.

speaker_heading: VIVIEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Now, I must let you work. I only
dialog: came to wish you good luck!
dialog: Goodbye, everyone!
text: The crew press around her. MARILYN watches, feeling more
text: than ever the odd one out. COLIN watches her from the edge
text: of the crowd. She cuts a lonely, vulnerable figure. He is
text: totally preoccupied with her, so much so that when VIVIEN
text: comes up behind him he turns guiltily as though caught out.
text: VIVIEN stares at him. All her exuberance has vanished and
text: she looks suddenly tired and older. It as though the facade
text: of a beautiful building is beginning to crack. She gazes at

text: He shrugs awkwardly. MILTON looks at OLIVIER in panic.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: He shouldn't be talking to her.
dialog: He's just a kid. Supposing he
dialog: says something? (Pause) Why the
dialog: hell didn't she call me?
text: His angry - and jealous - frustration is in stark contrast
text: to OLIVIER, who looks at COLIN with a new interest,
dialog: wondering if there is anything in this odd situation that
text: can work to his advantage. He smiles calmly.
speaker_heading: OLIVIER
dialog: I'm sure Colin knows what he's
dialog: doing. Don't you, Colin?
text: There is a warning as well as approval in his tone.

scene_heading: 97 INT. PARKSIDE HOUSE. DRAWING ROOM. DAY. 97
text: ROGER leads COLIN into the formal drawing room.
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: Miss Monroe said for you to wait.
dialog: She won't be long.
text: He looks at COLIN dubiously as he goes out. COLIN is
text: nervous and not quite sure what to do with himself. He
text: looks at the drinks in their decanters on the sideboard and
text: is suddenly desperate for some Dutch courage. He finds the
text: brandy and picks it up -
speaker_heading: MARILYN
speaker_heading: (OFF)
dialog: Help yourself to a drink.
text: COLIN wheels in surprise. MARILYN stands in the doorway,
text: casually but beautifully dressed in silk trousers and a
text: pale cream shirt. COLIN looks guiltily at the brandy.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: I was just... checking you've got
dialog: everything you need.
text: She walks to the sideboard, standing only a few inches away
text: from him. He can't take his eyes from hers. He drops his
text: gaze, only to find himself staring at her breasts. He looks
text: up again sharply but not before she notices. She takes the
text: decanter from his hand.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: Here, let me.
text: She pours some brandy into a glass and gives it to him.
speaker_heading: MARILYN (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you frightened of me, Colin?
text: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 72.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: Good. Because I like you.
text: Colin doesn't know what to say. MARILYN gazes at him.
speaker_heading: MARILYN (CONT'D)
dialog: I want you to help me. Will you
dialog: do that?
text: She looks at him, her eyes wide. COLIN feels himself
text: sinking into her gaze.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: I'm only the third. Just a
dialog: messenger, really.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: But you know what's going on. You
dialog: can see both sides of the
dialog: situation.
text: He shrugs in helpless agreement.
speaker_heading: MARILYN (CONT'D)
dialog: I want you to be honest. Tell me
dialog: everything.
text: She indicates a chair and COLIN perches on it awkwardly.
speaker_heading: MARILYN (CONT'D)
dialog: Relax. I thought you weren't
dialog: scared of me. (Pause) Are you
dialog: hungry? I'll have them send in a
dialog: tray. I'm starved.
text: He doesn't know how to reply and Marilyn misreads his
text: silence. Her eyes widen in dismay.
speaker_heading: MARILYN (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, gee, I'm sorry. Am I
dialog: interrupting something? Maybe you
dialog: have a Mrs. Colin waiting for you
dialog: at home?
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: There's no Mrs. Colin.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: So we can talk as long as we
dialog: like?
text: He nods uncertainly. She frowns.
speaker_heading: MARILYN (CONT'D)
dialog: Why is Sir Olivier so mean?
dialog: He talks to me as if he's
text: slumming.
text: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 73.
dialog: 
text: COLIN hesitates then decides to throw caution to the wind.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: I'll tell you what's wrong. It's
dialog: agony for him because he's a
dialog: great actor who wants to be a
dialog: film star, and agony for you
dialog: because you're a film star who
dialog: wants to be a great actress. And
dialog: this film won't help either of
dialog: you.
text: He stops, breathless, knowing he has gone to far. She
text: stares at him, wide-eyed with surprise. Horribly self-
text: conscious he takes a too large swig of his brandy, reddens
text: and coughs. She laughs.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: Are you sure you can handle that?
dialog: You don't look old enough to
dialog: drink.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: I'm 23, Miss Monroe.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: It's Marilyn. (Pause) I'm 30. I
dialog: guess that makes me an old lady
dialog: to you.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Seven years is nothing.
text: She smiles then sits opposite him.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: Do you know I've been married
dialog: three times already? How did that
dialog: happen?
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: You were just looking for the
dialog: right man.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: They always look right at the
dialog: start.
text: She smiles wistfully. Her presence is overwhelming. The
text: silence stretches for a second, pregnant with strange
text: possibilities. Suddenly the phone rings, making him jump.
text: Automatically he picks it up.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 74.

scene_heading: 98 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. PRODUCTION OFFICE. DAY. 98
text: MILTON sits at his desk. He leans forward anxiously at the
text: sound of Colin's voice.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Colin? Is everything okay? What
dialog: did she want?
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: 99 INT. PARKSIDE HOUSE. DRAWING ROOM. DAY. 99
text: COLIN looks at MARILYN and hesitates.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Everything's fine. Miss Monroe
dialog: just had... some large packages
dialog: she needed handling...
text: He looks at MARILYN's voluptuous figure. MARILYN looks back
text: innocently and mouths the word "packages". She giggles. He
text: turns crimson with the effort of trying to suppress his own
text: laughter but MARILYN isn't helping. She teasingly makes
text: shapes in the air of just how large the packages might be.
text: He covers the phone, agonised, before they both collapse in
text: irrepressible laughter. COLIN finally pulls himself
dialog: together.
speaker_heading: COLIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Hello? Milton?
text: There is a long silence at the other end of the line.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: 100 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. PRODUCTION OFFICE. DAY. 100
text: MILTON turns pale. When he speaks again his anger is just
text: barely under control.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Let me speak to her, Colin.
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: 101 INT. PARKSIDE HOUSE. DRAWING ROOM. DAY. 101
text: COLIN offers the phone to MARILYN but she shakes her head.
speaker_heading: COLIN
text: She's tied up right now.
text: This only sets MARILYN off again. She howls with laughter and
text: COLIN can't help joining her.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 75.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 102 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. PRODUCTION OFFICE. DAY. 102

speaker_heading: MILTON
text: What's going on? Colin! (Shouts)
dialog: Let me talk to her, damn it!
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: 103 INT. PARKSIDE HOUSE. DRAWING ROOM. DAY. 103
text: COLIN looks at MARILYN but she shakes her head between
text: giggles. He turns back to the phone, barely able to get the
text: words out between snorts of laughter.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: I'm sorry, Milton. I have to go.
text: He hangs up quickly. They both laugh helplessly. MARILYN
dialog: smiles.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: Let's walk in the garden. See if
dialog: we can find any more reporters in
dialog: the bushes.
text: She giggles. COLIN's heart contracts as she casually takes
text: his arm.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 104 EXT. PARKSIDE HOUSE. GARDEN. DAY/DUSK. 104
text: There is a golden glow on the horizon as the sun sinks.
text: MARILYN, a cardigan around her shoulders, walks along the
text: path. COLIN is at her side, acutely aware of her physical
dialog: closeness.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: I didn't know it was so pretty
dialog: out here.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: You should get out more. See the
dialog: sights.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: I am the sights.
text: She giggles again, her mood lighter.
speaker_heading: MARILYN (CONT'D)
dialog: Look at us. We're just like
dialog: Elsie and the young King. What
dialog: would Sir Laurence say if he
dialog: could see us now?
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: I don't think he'd mind.
text: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 76.
dialog: 
text: MARILYN grows reflective. She takes COLIN's arm in a
text: friendly way as they walk.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: I wanted to be an artist. To
dialog: grow as an actor. I was so proud
dialog: to be working with the great
dialog: Olivier. (Pause) Now he thinks
dialog: I'm the enemy.
text: She looks at him innocently. COLIN hesitates.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: He doesn't understand your kind
dialog: of actor. He's hated the method
dialog: ever since Vivien worked with
dialog: Elia Kazan. It's all too new and
dialog: strange. You're the future, and
text: it frightens him.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: Every time I walk into the studio
dialog: I feel this sense of doom come
text: over me. He looks at me like
text: he's smelling a pile of rotten
dialog: fish. And the crew hate me.
dialog: Paula is the only person I can
dialog: trust. (Pause) Except for you
dialog: now, maybe.
text: She looks at him, her eyes huge. COLIN feels his senses
text: swim as he stares into them...
text: ... and then ROGER suddenly appears on the steps.
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: Phone call for you, Miss Monroe.
dialog: It's Mr. Miller.
text: MARILYN goes back up the path towards the house, glancing
text: back briefly at Colin.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: Goodbye, Colin. Thanks for
dialog: telling me the truth.
text: COLIN stares after her. It is a second before he realises
text: that ROGER is gazing at him sternly.
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: You'll be leaving now, I expect.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: 105 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. OLIVIER'S DRESSING ROOM. 105
speaker_heading: DAY.
text: The next morning. COLIN walks in as OLIVIER is talking to
speaker_heading: MILTON.
text: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 76A.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLIVIER
dialog: I don't care if he fucks her
dialog: sideways. Perhaps it'll calm her
dialog: down. (Pause) Oh, hello, boy.
text: He smiles cheerfully.
text: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 77.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLIVIER (CONT'D)
dialog: I hear you spent last night with
dialog: Marilyn.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: I didn't spend the night with
dialog: her. We just had a chat.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: I heard them chuckling.
text: OLIVIER offers COLIN a lewdly suggestive grin.
speaker_heading: OLIVIER
dialog: Perhaps if Colin is very
dialog: diplomatic Marilyn is more likely
dialog: to behave herself.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: She just wants a chum, that's
dialog: all.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: A chum? Jesus Christ, what is
dialog: this, Goodbye Mr. Chips? Grow up,
dialog: kid.
text: He barges out of the room, slamming the door behind him.
text: OLIVIER checks the effect of his Grand Duke in the mirror
text: and sighs abruptly.
speaker_heading: OLIVIER
dialog: I thought working with Marilyn
dialog: would make me feel young again.
text: But I look dead in the rushes.
text: Dead behind the eyes.
text: He gazes at himself thoughtfully.
speaker_heading: OLIVIER (CONT'D)
dialog: Perhaps I'm angry with her
dialog: because in my heart I know my own
dialog: career is in a terrible rut. I
dialog: wanted to renew myself through
dialog: her but all I see reflected in
dialog: that magnificent face is my own
dialog: inadequacy.
text: He leans back.
speaker_heading: OLIVIER (CONT'D)
dialog: You know, I admire Marilyn. I
dialog: really do. Despite her behaviour.
dialog: She has taken everything
dialog: Hollywood can throw at her and
text: triumphed.
text: COLIN waits, uncertain why OLIVIER is confiding in him.
text: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 78.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLIVIER (CONT'D)
dialog: An actress has to be pretty tough
dialog: to get even a tenth as far as she
dialog: has.
text: He glances up at COLIN in the mirror, shrewd and
dialog: sympathetic.
speaker_heading: OLIVIER (CONT'D)
dialog: But be careful, boy. She doesn't
dialog: need to be rescued. Not really.

scene_heading: 106 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 106
text: Gossip is always fast to travel but on a film it goes at
text: the speed of light. As COLIN arrives on the set he is
text: greeted with wolf whistles and jeers by RICHARD WATTIS,
text: PAUL HARDWICK and the crew.
speaker_heading: SOUNDMAN
dialog: What was Marilyn like then, Col?
speaker_heading: HARDWICK
text: Going over her lines with her,
dialog: were you?
speaker_heading: SOUNDMAN
dialog: Will she be in today or is she
dialog: too tired?
dialog: It is all good-natured stuff but COLIN feels strangely
text: protective, not so much on his own behalf as Marilyn's.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: She was just being friendly.
speaker_heading: WATTIS
dialog: I'll bet.
text: There are hoots of laughter. COLIN retreats to a corner
text: only to find RICHARD WATTIS pursuing him.
speaker_heading: WATTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Ever heard of the Venus Fly Trap?
dialog: There you are, Colin the innocent
text: little fly buzzing about happily,
text: when suddenly a heavenly scent
dialog: attracts you and - Snap!
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Oh, fuck off, Dickie. You've
dialog: never slept with a woman in your
dialog: life.
text: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 79.

speaker_heading: WATTIS
dialog: I know a Femme Fatale when I see
dialog: one, love.

scene_heading: 107 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 107
text: A brief hiatus in filming. COLIN looks on uneasily as
text: MARILYN, resting against her lean-to, has her costume
text: attended to by LUCY.
speaker_heading: ORTON
text: Three minutes, ladies and gents.
text: Three minutes.
text: It has just dawned on COLIN that he has missed his date
text: with LUCY. Before he can react he is jerked violently
text: behind the scenery and pushed up against the wall by an
text: angry MILTON.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Arthur Miller called me. He's not
dialog: happy with you.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: He doesn't even know who I am.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Marilyn must have said something.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Maybe she was trying to make him
dialog: jealous...
text: ORTON turns around frowning furiously at the voices behind
text: the set. MILTON pushes COLIN off the set ahead of him.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 108 EXT. STUDIO. DAY. 108
text: MILTON turns bitterly on Colin as soon as they are outside
text: the studio door.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Listen, kid, I've known Marilyn
dialog: for seven years. I fell in love
dialog: with her, just like you've done.
text: COLIN is about to protest but MILTON ignores him.
speaker_heading: MILTON (CONT'D)
dialog: We had ten days together and that
dialog: was it. She picked me up, she put
dialog: me down. That's what she does.
dialog: She breaks hearts. She'll break
dialog: yours. My advice to you is to
dialog: quit before you get burned.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: I don't need your advice. And I'm
text: not in love with her.
text: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 80.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Okay, have it your way. (Pause)
dialog: You don't see Marilyn again, you
dialog: don't even talk to her. She is
dialog: completely off-limits to you. Got
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: 109 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. CORRIDOR. DAY. 109
text: COLIN hurries along the corridor, looking for LUCY, who he
text: sees pushing a rack of clothes. He stops awkwardly. She
text: gazes at him meaningfully, hurt and puzzled.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I waited for you on Friday.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Oh, God... I'm sorry... I forgot...
dialog: I've just been so busy.
speaker_heading: LUCY
speaker_heading: (SHARP)
dialog: So I hear.
speaker_heading: COLIN
speaker_heading: (SHRUGS)
dialog: You know how crews gossip.
dialog: There's nothing in it.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Of course there isn't. Marilyn
dialog: Monroe fancying you? Come on.
text: COLIN is put out. Up to now he has never fully confronted
text: the possibility of Marilyn wanting him, but he doesn't like
text: the idea being dismissed so lightly.
text: Lucy sees it and her eyes widen in surprise and hurt.
text: Before she can respond MARILYN herself coming towards them
text: in her gown, her hair up in towel, surrounded by PAULA and
text: her MAKE-UP people. She offers him a dazzling smile.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: Hi, Colin.
text: COLIN smiles, self-conscious. MARILYN stops and frowns,
text: looking at Lucy.
speaker_heading: MARILYN (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, are you guys dating? That's
dialog: what I heard.
text: She looks at him expectantly and suddenly his growing
dialog: fantasy that she might actually be interested in him kicks
text: in hard. He shrugs casually.
text: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 81.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Of course not. You know how crews
dialog: like to gossip.
text: His voice trails off lamely as he realises he is repeating
text: what he has just said to Lucy. MARILYN smiles.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: Too bad. You look cute together.
text: She walks off with her retinue. There is a long pause.
text: COLIN looks up to see LUCY staring at him in dismay. There
text: are sudden tears in her eyes, which she wipes away angrily.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I thought you were different.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Lucy, I really like you. We've had
dialog: such fun...
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: And now it's time to set your
dialog: sights a little higher. I get it.
dialog: (Pause) Who do you think you are,
dialog: Cary Grant?
text: She shoves the rack of clothes back towards the wardrobe
text: department. Part of him knows he should go after her, but in
text: the end he just stays where he is. He can't help feeling an
text: unworthy sense of relief.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: 110 INT. DOG AND DUCK PUB. COLIN'S BEDROOM. NIGHT. 110
text: COLIN crosses to the mean little bed on its iron frame and
text: collapses on it gratefully. The noise of the rowdy pub floats
text: up through the floorboards. He covers his ears with his hands
text: then folds the pillow over his head in a desperate attempt to
dialog: block it out.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: 111 EXT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. DAY. 111
text: The studio is quiet at the weekend. COLIN walks along,
text: snatching a moment for a cigarette. As he reaches the doors
text: to the editing suites a battered old Wolsey draws up beside
text: him. ROGER SMITH is at the wheel.
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: Get in.
text: COLIN looks at him in confusion. The studio doors open and
text: MILTON emerges. He glances darkly at COLIN and ROGER.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Any problem, Roger?
text: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 82.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: Just dropped by to take Colin out
dialog: to lunch.
text: COLIN looks surprised. MILTON notices. COLIN stubs out his
text: cigarette and hurries to the passenger door.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: You're not taking him to Marilyn?
dialog: That would drop us all in a whole
dialog: ocean of shit.
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: Oh, no, sir.
text: MILTON sees a bulky blanket on the back seat.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: What do you have in there?
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: Just a picnic. We've been looking
dialog: forward to it, haven't we, Colin?
text: COLIN looks at him, bemused. He gets in quickly. MILTON
text: frowns but shrugs and walks off with a wave.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Okay, well, have a nice time boys.
text: Inside the car COLIN looks at ROGER.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Is she okay?
text: In the same moment MARILYN herself erupts from under the
text: blanket in the back.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
speaker_heading: SURPRISE!
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Oh, Jesus -
text: She laughs, looking wonderfully naughty.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: Roger and I decided to take you out
dialog: for an adventure. Didn't we Roger?
speaker_heading: ROGER
speaker_heading: (PAINED)
dialog: Indeed we did.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Oh, God. If Milton sees me with
dialog: you... I'll be sacked...
text: He tries to scramble out but MARILYN hauls him back
text: gleefully.
text: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 83.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: No one can sack you, Colin. (Pause)
dialog: Except me, of course.
text: She pats the seat next to her.
speaker_heading: MARILYN (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't like being on my own in the
dialog: back.
text: Before COLIN can respond he sees the curious MILTON running
text: back, having spotted MARILYN in the back.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: What the hell?
text: He peers into the back window. MARILYN screams and buries
text: herself back under the blanket. COLIN scrambles to get over
text: into the back seat while ROGER stamps on the accelerator and
text: the car roars off.
speaker_heading: MILTON (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (SHOUTS)
dialog: Colin! Get back here, you little
dialog: bastard! You're fired! Do you hear
dialog: me? Fired!
text: COLIN winces. ROGER looks at him sympathetically. MARILYN
text: emerges from under the blanket, tousled and laughing.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: Do you think he saw me?
text: COLIN can't help laughing. He finally tumbles into the back
text: seat with MARILYN as the car speeds away. She scoots up to
dialog: make room for him.
speaker_heading: MARILYN (CONT'D)
dialog: Snuggle up. This is fun.
text: She threads her arm through his. He gazes down at their hands
dialog: meshed together.
text: ROGER's disapproval registers in the faintest flicker of his
dialog: eyes.
text: In the background the defeated and frustrated MILTON watches

dialog: 
text: There is no one else around. The wind sighs and the grass
text: is pleasantly warm underfoot. MARILYN turns her face up to
dialog: the sun.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: This is how I ought to feel every
dialog: day.
text: COLIN smiles. Impulsively MARILYN hugs him.
speaker_heading: MARILYN (CONT'D)
dialog: Let's run away together.
text: He turns ashen.
speaker_heading: MARILYN (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (LAUGHS)
dialog: Just kidding.
text: She looks around happily. COLIN smiles at her.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: We have today, anyway. One day to
dialog: do whatever we like. We can go
text: back to real life tomorrow.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: Only one day?
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Well, maybe the weekend.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: Or a week?
text: He grins. She takes his hand, walking contentedly at his
dialog: side.
speaker_heading: MARILYN (CONT'D)
dialog: What shall we do?
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: We could go to Windsor Castle, if
dialog: you like.

scene_heading: 115 EXT. ROGER'S CAR. WINDSOR CASTLE. DAY. 115
text: ROGER has parked up by the sentry post at the entrance to

text: ROGER nods to the policemen, who instantly recognise one of
dialog: their own.
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: Detective Chief Superintendant
dialog: Smith. I'm escorting this lady
dialog: and gentleman for the day. They'd
dialog: like to look around the castle.
text: As the policemen see MARILYN their eyes widen.
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: Christ, is that..?
text: He stares in disbelief. ROGER smiles.
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: Well, it's not Diana bloody Dors,
dialog: is it?
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: (After a second)
dialog: Does she know anyone here, sir?
dialog: We need to write down a contact
dialog: name in the book.
text: ROGER looks stumped at this. He turns to Marilyn.
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: You don't know Her Majesty, by
dialog: any chance?
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: We met at a movie premiere. She
dialog: said my dress was pretty.
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: I'm not sure that quite...
speaker_heading: COLIN
speaker_heading: (INTERRUPTING)
dialog: My Godfather works here. He's the
dialog: Royal librarian, Sir Owen

text: The POLICEMAN looks sceptically at Colin's casual clothes.
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: Name?
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Clark. Colin Clark.
text: The POLICEMAN retreats into his box. We hear him talking on
text: the telephone. ROGER looks at COLIN. He shrugs sheepishly.
text: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 86.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COLIN (CONT'D)
dialog: My father knows everybody.
text: A moment later the policeman returns, looking surprised.
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN

text: The library is a series of magnificent rooms lined from

text: covered with important documents - the place is a shrine to
scene_heading: antique learning and culture. SIR OWEN MORSHEAD (63), the
text: Queen's librarian, is a pleasantly eccentric figure with a
text: sly wit. He greets COLIN with a friendly, distracted air.
speaker_heading: MORSHEAD
dialog: Colin, my boy! Come in, come in.
dialog: Forgive the dust.
text: He smiles at MARILYN, showing no sign whatever of
text: recognising her.
speaker_heading: MORSHEAD (CONT'D)
dialog: You are pretty, my dear. I'm sure
dialog: you and Colin have so much in
dialog: common.
text: MARILYN looks around in awe.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: Gee, I'd love to read all these
dialog: books some time.
text: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 87.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MORSHEAD
dialog: Luckily one doesn't really have

text: He finds a portfolio on the table and opens it.
speaker_heading: MORSHEAD (CONT'D)
dialog: These are by an artist called
dialog: Holbein.
text: MARILYN smiles at a portrait of a young woman.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: She's beautiful.
speaker_heading: MORSHEAD
dialog: She was the daughter of one of
dialog: the King's courtiers, nearly 400
dialog: years ago.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: I hope I look that good when I'm
dialog: 400.
text: MORSHEAD laughs. He takes down another folder of drawings.
speaker_heading: MORSHEAD
dialog: And these are all by Leonardo Da
dialog: Vinci.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: I've heard of him! Didn't he
dialog: paint that lady with the funny
dialog: smile?
text: She looks at him, wide-eyed, playing up to her image as the
text: dizzy blonde. In fact she knows exactly who Da Vinci is, and
text: MORSHEAD is tactful enough to acknowledge it gracefully.
speaker_heading: MORSHEAD
dialog: The Mona Lisa.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: Do you have that one here too?
speaker_heading: MORSHEAD
dialog: Alas, that one got away.
text: He closes the portfolio and takes MARILYN's arm briskly.
speaker_heading: MORSHEAD (CONT'D)
dialog: Now, let's go to the Queen's
dialog: apartments. She's not here at the
dialog: moment, but she will be sorry to
dialog: have missed you.
text: MARILYN looks at him, wide-eyed.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: Really?

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MORSHEAD
dialog: Oh, yes. Why, she was only saying
dialog: to me the other day, "what must
dialog: it be like to be the most famous
dialog: woman on earth"?
text: He shares a sly smile with COLIN. He knows exactly who
text: Marilyn is and is enjoying every second of her company. He
text: leads her out, with COLIN trailing in their wake.
speaker_heading: MORSHEAD (CONT'D)

text: It is so big she can lean inside and see the detail in

speaker_heading: MARILYN

speaker_heading: MARILYN (CONT'D)
dialog: I sure never had a dolls' house

speaker_heading: MARILYN (CONT'D)
dialog: This is me, that's you, and these

text: She smiles wistfully and puts her hand on his arm.
speaker_heading: MARILYN (CONT'D)
dialog: Our daughter's so pretty. All
dialog: little girls should be told how

speaker_heading: MARILYN (CONT'D)
dialog: We look like such a happy family,
dialog: don't we?

dialog: 
text: She turns to him. They are only inches away from each

speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: Shall I be "her"?
text: She jumps up onto a step and strikes a pose - hip out,
text: shoulders back, bosom thrust forward, the classic Marilyn

speaker_heading: SPECTATOR
dialog: Are you somebody, mate?
speaker_heading: COLIN
speaker_heading: (SMILES)

speaker_heading: COLIN

dialog: 
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: That's where the boys were sent

dialog: Where we were whipped.
text: MARILYN looks at him in shock.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: Whipped?
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Beaten.
text: She looks appalled.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: I'd never send my kids away.
dialog: (pause) How long were you here?
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Five years. But I was sent to
dialog: boarding school when I was eight.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: That's what we do in my family.
text: She smiles at this, looking at him shrewdly.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: It seems to me that you've had most
dialog: things pretty easy.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: In one way, yes. But when you're
text: brought up in a house of over-
dialog: achievers, it's hard to make your
dialog: own mark.
text: She looks at him, sympathetic but pushing a little harder.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: So how are you going to do it?
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Maybe it will be in films, but if
dialog: not, there are so many
dialog: possibilities out there.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: Sounds pretty good to me.
text: She smiles warmly, liking him a lot more for his openness.
dialog: We sense their relationship has moved quietly to a different

text: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 90A.
dialog:

speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: Work hard, boys! I don't want

text: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 91.
dialog: 
text: He tears his eyes away from her as she casually strips her

speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: What if a boat goes past? We

speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: Don't worry. Roger will fix it.
dialog: Oh, darn it...
text: She holds her head and he looks at her with concern.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: I have something in my eye.
text: He swims across to her, very aware of her naked body under
text: the water. She holds her head up to him.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: I can't see anything.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: Get closer.
text: She tips her head back. He looks deep into her eyes - and
text: suddenly she grabs him and kisses him on the lips. Before
text: he can respond she laughs playfully and swims away.
speaker_heading: MARILYN (CONT'D)
dialog: That's the first time I've kissed
dialog: anyone younger than me. There's a
dialog: lot of older guys in Hollywood.
text: She swims happily, totally relaxed. COLIN is much more self-

text: away, embarrassed.
text: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 92.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARILYN (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't be shy, Colin. It's nothing
dialog: you haven't seen before.
text: COLIN wades awkwardly to the shore, trying to conceal his
text: erection with his cupped hands. MARILYN giggles.
speaker_heading: MARILYN (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, Colin! And you an old
dialog: Etonian!
text: He grins. She reaches for her blouse and stands shivering
text: as she tries to dry herself. COLIN goes to take her in his
dialog: arms.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Let me warm you up.
text: She snuggles into him gratefully, her teeth chattering. He
text: rubs her naked back briskly, her thin blouse the only
text: barrier between their bodies. Slowly his embrace becomes
text: more sensual, his hands slowing, stroking rather than
text: rubbing, his face buried in her hair, his arms pulling her
speaker_heading: CLOSER -
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: Don't spoil it.
text: She looks at him, her expression knowing but sweet.
speaker_heading: MARILYN (CONT'D)
dialog: I want this to be the perfect
dialog: date.
text: He tries to kiss her but she ducks her head away gently,
text: her expression wistful.
speaker_heading: MARILYN (CONT'D)
dialog: I haven't had a real date since I
dialog: was 13 years old.
text: She suddenly looks much younger, her smile a poignant echo
dialog: of a lost childhood.
text: He steps back politely, allowing her to put on her blouse.
text: As she buttons it, she gazes at him, then impulsively leans
text: forward to kiss him chastely on the lips. The kiss is as
dialog: sweet and innocent as any 13 year old might wish.
text: The kiss lasts for a few seconds, their lips touching
text: gently, the river shimmering magically in the sunshine
text: behind them. When they finally break apart she rewards him
text: with a radiant smile.
speaker_heading: MARILYN (CONT'D)
dialog: That was nice. I don't get kissed
dialog: much.
text: She looks wistful for a second but quickly brightens.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARILYN (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, what do we do now?
text: COLIN looks at her, knowing it is time to return to the

text: cough and ROGER appears.
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: Time to go home, I think, Miss
dialog: Monroe.
text: She smiles, a little sadly, then gets up, walking past him

speaker_heading: ROGER (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: I don't know what you did to her,

speaker_heading: COLIN

speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Someone like you?

speaker_heading: MILTON

speaker_heading: COLIN

speaker_heading: MILTON (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MILTON (CONT'D)
dialog: I've got every penny I ever made

speaker_heading: COLIN

speaker_heading: MARILYN

speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: I'm sure they do.
text: He nods. She smiles sadly.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: You're lucky.
text: Her eyes fill with tears. She looks up at him anxiously.
speaker_heading: MARILYN (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you love me, Colin?
text: He stares at her. She looks lovely but desperately
dialog: vulnerable.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Yes.
text: She reaches for the pills and pours three or four into her
text: palm. COLIN gently takes her hand and takes two of them
text: away. She smiles, not objecting as he settles her back
text: gently on the pillow.
speaker_heading: COLIN (CONT'D)
dialog: But you and I come from different
dialog: worlds. You're like some Greek
dialog: Goddess to me...
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: I'm not Greek.
text: She smiles, teasing him. He smiles back. She takes his
text: hand, looking at him in appeal.
speaker_heading: MARILYN (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't want to be a Goddess. I
dialog: just want to be loved like an
dialog: ordinary girl.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Mr. Miller loves you.
text: She stares at him, her face going blank with misery.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: I found his notebook. It said I'd
dialog: let him down.
text: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 101.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Writers scribble all kinds of
dialog: things. It doesn't mean anything.
text: She looks at him, her eyes full of pain.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: He wanted me to find it. It said
dialog: he should never have married me.
dialog: That I was unpredictable and a
dialog: woman-child, flighty and self-
dialog: centred. He's left me, Colin. Why
dialog: do the people I love always leave
dialog: me?
text: She looks so wretched, so completely baffled, that COLIN
text: responds with sudden passion.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: I'll never leave you.
text: She smiles and embraces him gratefully. She sighs.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: All people ever see is Marilyn
text: Monroe. As soon as they realise
dialog: I'm not her, they run.
text: He lies down next to her, taking her awkwardly in his arms.
text: She sighs sleepily.
speaker_heading: MARILYN (CONT'D)
dialog: Boy, there's a lot of men in this
dialog: business. And they all think
dialog: you've got to sleep with them.
text: She looks across at him, their faces inches apart.
speaker_heading: MARILYN (CONT'D)
dialog: You're not like that. That's why
dialog: I like you.
text: COLIN stares back at her guiltily. She smiles.
speaker_heading: MARILYN (CONT'D)
dialog: You should date that Wardrobe
dialog: lady. She's pretty.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: I don't want to. (Pause) I love
dialog: you, Marilyn.
text: She stares at him and tears gather in her eyes again. They
text: stare intently at each other, their mood fragile, touched
text: with both sensuality and a longing for something less
text: tangible. MARILYN leans forward and kisses him gently. The
text: embrace grows in passion and they kiss properly, hungrily.
text: He kisses her eyes and her face and she sighs happily.
dialog: He wants her more than he has wanted anything before.
text: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 102.
dialog: 
text: And then he stops. The fantasy he has been pursuing for
text: weeks is within his grasp but he knows that whatever it
text: does for him it will only damage her further. He pulls away
text: from her gently. Her eyes flicker open lazily.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: What's the matter? Don't you want
dialog: to make love?
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Maybe we should just be friends.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: Okay. Friends.
text: She wraps herself around him, curling up so their bodies
text: cradle each other like spoons in a cutlery draw. As she
text: buries her head in his neck he feels her breasts against
text: his back. She curls against him.
speaker_heading: MARILYN (CONT'D)
dialog: This is nice. Like spoons. I used
dialog: to do this with Johnny.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Who's Johnny?
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: Johnny Hyde. My agent, back in
dialog: the old days. He was thin, like
dialog: you...
text: Her voice is blurred and drifting with sleep. With her body
text: warm against him COLIN's resolve nearly snaps but he is
text: clear eyed now and determined.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Marilyn?
text: She mutters softly in reply.
speaker_heading: COLIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Do one thing for me? Come into

speaker_heading: MARILYN (AS ELSIE)

text: MARILYN is utterly adorable. The crew, COLIN, amongst them,

text: behind the camera. They have a good take and they know it.
speaker_heading: ORTON
dialog: Cut it there!
text: MARILYN is as happy as we have ever seen her. She seeks out

text: She looks at him for a long, unnerving moment then speaks
text: with sudden ferocity.
speaker_heading: PAULA
dialog: From the first moment all I have
text: felt is Olivier's loathing and
dialog: contempt. He thinks I'm
dialog: unnecessary. Me, her drama coach,

dialog: act, dole out pills, bolster her
dialog: ego, keep her sober enough to work.
dialog: (Pause) Me. Unnecessary. (Pause) No
dialog: me, no Marilyn.

text: MARILYN lies in bed with MILTON possessively at her side.

speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: You think I can act, don't you,

speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Of course I do. You were

speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: I want him to stay with me.
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: What would Arthur say if he knew

speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: You heard what she said. She
dialog: wants me here.
text: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 106.
dialog: 
text: MILTON looks at him grimly but finally surrenders the

text: bed, stroking Marilyn's hand.
speaker_heading: PAULA
dialog: You have no idea of your position
dialog: in the world, Marilyn. You are the
dialog: greatest actress there's ever been.
dialog: Not just actress. The greatest

speaker_heading: PAULA (CONT'D)
dialog: It's hard now, but believe me you

text: Paula's love and sincerity are obvious. She means it. COLIN

text: Finally she drags herself out, leaving them alone.
text: As the door closes MARILYN curls herself up in the bed.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: I'm so tired of feeling scared.
dialog: Life is so shitty. I hate it. It

speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: I'm here now. I'll look after

text: She gives him a wry look, teasing but thoughtful.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: Good old Colin. Looking after me,

speaker_heading: PAULA
dialog: Marilyn! Marilyn, my baby, what
dialog: has Colin done to you?
speaker_heading: COLIN

text: Her eyes widen in surprise. A flicker of nervous insecurity

speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: You think I'm crazy?
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: I didn't mean that. I just meant
dialog: you could be happy.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: I am happy. I got everything I
dialog: ever dreamed about.
text: She smiles tentatively, but he sees a terrible fear in her

speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Of course you're happy. (Pause)
dialog: You're a star. The biggest star

text: She sings with touching delicacy, nailing it perfectly. There

speaker_heading: JACOBS
dialog: It's been a lot of fun, kids. See
dialog: you at the Academy Awards.
text: He goes out, grabbing a discarded bottle of booze from the
text: dustbin as he goes.
text: COLIN watches all this in shocked silence. He looks at the
text: label on his own small parcel, which reads simply "To Colin,
dialog: with thanks, Marilyn".
text: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 114.

scene_heading: 150A INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. WARDROBE DEPT. DAY. 150A
text: The wardrobe department is empty except for LUCY, who
text: cradles her own gift from Marilyn. COLIN comes in, looking
text: nervous. They look at each other awkwardly.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Aren't you going to throw yours
dialog: away?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Of course not. It's from Marilyn
dialog: Monroe.
text: He smiles. She shrugs and turns to leave.
text: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 115.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: (After a second)
dialog: Lucy?
text: She turns back to look at him.
speaker_heading: COLIN (CONT'D)
dialog: I was wondering if you're doing
dialog: anything this Saturday.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I'm washing my hair.
text: He nods, accepting this as no more than he deserves. She
text: goes but then stops to look back at him.
speaker_heading: LUCY (CONT'D)
dialog: Did she break your heart?
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: (After a second)
dialog: A little.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Good. It needed breaking.
text: There is no malice in her response, just an awareness that
text: he is older and wiser now, and perhaps a better man for the
text: experience. He nods, accepting the rebuke.
speaker_heading: LUCY (CONT'D)
dialog: (After a second)
dialog: I might be free on Wednesday.
text: COLIN smiles. She goes out. He looks down at Marilyn's
text: present in his hands.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: 151 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. HALL. DAY. 151
text: COLIN walks down the hall. He notices the red light is on
text: outside the viewing theatre. As he goes towards it he sees
text: ROGER coming the other way on his way out of the studio, his
text: job done. The two men smile; an acknowledgment of everything
text: they've been through together. ROGER offers him a friendly
text: salute and then goes on his way.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 152 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. VIEWING THEATRE. DAY. 152
text: OLIVIER sits on his own, watching an edited version of the
text: "The Coconut Girl" sequence (Scenes 61 and 62). COLIN comes
text: in. OLIVIER glances at him.
speaker_heading: OLIVIER
dialog: "You do look, my son, in a moved
dialog: sort/As if you were dismay'd: be
dialog: cheerful, sir./Our revels now are
dialog: ended.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
text: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 116.
speaker_heading: OLIVIER (CONT'D)
dialog: These our actors,/As I foretold
dialog: you, were all spirits and/Are
text: melted into air, into thin air...
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Prospero.
speaker_heading: OLIVIER
speaker_heading: (SMILES)
dialog: We are such stuff/As dreams are
dialog: made on, and our little life/Is
dialog: rounded with a sleep..."
text: COLIN sits down next to the great man. They watch in
text: silence as another sequence is projected for them. The
text: sequence shows MARILYN improvising in the champagne and
text: caviar scene. She serves herself food and drink before
text: collapsing, drunk. The endless retakes and fluffs gone,
text: what remains is a gifted comic performance by a luminous
dialog: beauty.
speaker_heading: OLIVIER (CONT'D)
dialog: (After a second)
dialog: She's quite wonderful. No
dialog: training, no craft, no guile,
text: just pure instinct. Astonishing.
text: He seems almost lost in awe. COLIN gazes at him in
dialog: surprise.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: You should tell her that.
speaker_heading: OLIVIER
dialog: Oh, I will. But she won't believe
dialog: me. That's probably what makes
dialog: her great. It's certainly what
text: makes her so profoundly unhappy.
text: He smiles wryly.
speaker_heading: OLIVIER (CONT'D)
dialog: I tried my best to change her,
dialog: but she remains brilliant despite
dialog: me. (Pause) Directing a movie has
dialog: to be just about the best job
dialog: ever invented, but Marilyn has
dialog: cured me of ever wanting to do it
dialog: again.
text: He signals to the projection box and the film stops as the
text: lights come up.
speaker_heading: OLIVIER (CONT'D)
dialog: And now I'm going back to the
text: theatre. John Osborne is writing
dialog: a piece for me.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: I thought you hated all that
dialog: Royal Court stuff.
text: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 117.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLIVIER
speaker_heading: (SMILES)
dialog: Miller made me see things
dialog: differently. (Pause) You have to
dialog: find new worlds to conquer, if
dialog: you want to be the best. And
dialog: believe me, most of the time, I
dialog: really am the best.
text: He goes to the door and pauses.
speaker_heading: OLIVIER (CONT'D)
dialog: You've done a good job, boy.
dialog: (Pause) Welcome to the circus.
text: He goes out. COLIN looks back up at the projection box.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Run it again, please.
text: The lights go down. MARILYN's face appears on the screen,
text: laughing and happy. It is another sequence, the one where
text: Marilyn does her sweet, uninhibited little dance (Scene
text: 90), a performance both sexy and yet touchingly innocent.
text: HOLD on COLIN for a long moment, gazing at her image in the
dialog: darkness, then -
dialog: 
scene_heading: 152A INT. DOG AND DUCK PUB. DAY 152A
text: The circus is leaving. The film is shutting down. Not knowing
text: his next job COLIN sits, suitcase next to his chair, wearing
text: the 'Marilyn' experience on his face and in his soul. Head
text: down, sipping a pint. He could be a regular here.
text: BARRY behind the bar, flitting around - the dart players and
text: regulars at play.
text: And then, as if a gust of wind invaded, BARRY looks up and
text: freezes. The DART PLAYER, sensing something, turns to look up
text: as well. The regulars are frozen in mid-action.
text: COLIN is missing it all. 100% of his attention is given to
text: his woe and his pint.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: Buy a girl a drink?
text: COLIN doesn't turn. He recognizes the voice and smiles.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Can I get another one of those
dialog: please, Barry?
text: BARRY for once is silent, pours a pint. The regulars try not
dialog: to stare.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: I didn't want to leave without
dialog: saying goodbye.
text: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 117A.
dialog: 
text: MARILYN hands COLIN a package.
speaker_heading: MARILYN (CONT'D)
dialog: The first time you saw this, all I
dialog: had on was the radio.
text: Colin opens the package. It's her copy of the script. On the
text: first page she has written a message scrawled in ink: TO THE
scene_heading: MOST CHARMING THIRD ASSISTANT DIRECTOR IN THE WORLD
speaker_heading: MARILYN (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't forget me.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: As if I could.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: Everyone else on the picture wishes
dialog: they could.
speaker_heading: COLIN
text: Everyone else doesn't understand.
text: She smiles, touched.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: Be a gentleman and walk me to my
dialog: car?
dialog: 
scene_heading: 152B EXT. DOG &amp; DUCK PUB. DAY 152B
text: The ever faithful Roger stands by the idling car. COLIN opens
text: the car door for MARILYN.
text: MARILYN beckons him closer. She kisses him gently. He smiles
dialog: and says lightly:
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: What's that for?
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: That's for being on my side; and
dialog: remember, when you see me wink,
dialog: that's for you.
text: ROGER walks around the car and looks over at COLIN.
speaker_heading: ROGER
speaker_heading: (glancing at COLIN)
text: Looking a couple of inches taller
dialog: than when I first saw you.
text: ROGER nods at COLIN (a silent salute suggesting job well
text: done.) He gets into the car and we stay on COLIN as he
text: watches it pull away. BARRY comes to the doorway of the pub.
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: Was that really Marilyn Monroe?
text: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 117B.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: No - just a good friend of mine.
text: BARRY walks back into the pub, leaving COLIN alone, staring
text: at the vanishing car. And then the sun swallows it as it
text: drives into the English countryside.
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: 153 EXT. WARDOUR STREET. LONDON. DAY. 153
text: COLIN walks along chatting to friends. Dressed in a neat
text: dark suit he looks older and more confident. There is
text: little sign left of the callow young man who paced up and
text: down the pavement outside Sir Laurence Olivier's office.
text: We see the caption: SIX YEARS LATER.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 154 INT. COLIN'S OFFICE. WARDOUR STREET. DAY. 154
text: COLIN walks into a small office. Film cans are piled up all
text: over the floor and books and papers spill off the shelves.
text: A SECRETARY sits typing at her desk. COLIN goes to his own
text: desk, glances at his diary, then looks up.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Any messages?
text: THE SECRETARY pushes a piece of paper at him.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: It's probably just someone having
dialog: a joke.
text: COLIN looks down at the message. There is a Los Angeles
dialog: phone number and then the name - Marilyn Monroe.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: (After a moment)
dialog: Did she say anything?
text: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 118.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: She just asked you to call.
dialog: (Pause) It is a joke, isn't it?
text: COLIN stares down at the paper.
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: Probably. (Pause) Book a call as
dialog: soon as you can. Los Angeles,
dialog: California. Brentwood 1890.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: 155 INT. COLIN'S OFFICE. WARDOUR STREET. NIGHT. 155
text: It is late. COLIN stares at the number on the scrap of
dialog: paper.
text: The phone rings. He picks it up eagerly.
speaker_heading: OPERATOR
dialog: Your call to Los Angeles.
text: We hear the crackle of the international line. He waits
text: anxiously as the ringing continues.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: 155A EXT. LOS ANGELES. MARILYN'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. DAY.
speaker_heading: 155A
text: ESTABLISH the luxurious exterior of Marilyn's comfortable
dialog: Brentwood house.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: 156 INT. LOS ANGELES. MARILYN'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. 156
speaker_heading: DAY.
text: The room is large and tasteful - white sofas and cushions
text: and deep rugs. Picture windows look out onto the Hollywood
dialog: hills.
text: A white phone rings on the table.
text: It rings continuously, insistently.
text: It carries on ringing.
text: No one comes.
text: HOLD on the jangling phone. Each time it rings we think
text: Marilyn might appear, but she never does.
text: It carries on ringing, unanswered, in the empty room. As
text: the picture fades we hear like a ghostly lament the sweet
text: echo of Marilyn's voice singing the Sleeping Prince Waltz.
text: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 119.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARILYN
speaker_heading: (VO)
dialog: "I found a dream and lay in your
dialog: arms the whole night through, I'm
dialog: yours no matter what others may
dialog: say or do. Be light of heart and
dialog: fancy free, that's the way to
dialog: start, there will be nothing to
dialog: lose till you lose your heart..."
text: The fragile voice hangs in the air for a second, then slowly
text: drifts away to nothing.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 157 INT. COLIN'S OFFICE. WARDOUR STREET. NIGHT. 157
text: COLIN sits with the phone to his ear. The sound of Marilyn
text: singing the Sleeping Prince Waltz dies away and we realise
text: has been revisiting it in his memory.
text: He waits as long as he can but it is obvious no one is going
text: to answer. In the end he puts the receiver back in its cradle
dialog: in resignation.
text: His gaze drifts up to a shelf stacked with film cans. He
text: stands up and looks through them, blowing dust away; they
text: have been here for a long time, ignored. He finds the one he
text: is looking for - it says simply MM on the can.
text: He takes the short reel of film and threads it through a
text: Movieola in the corner of the room. He turns it on and bends
dialog: to look.
text: The screen bursts into life with an image of MARILYN at her
text: most vital and captivating. It is a copy of some rushes from
dialog: The Prince And The Showgirl, perhaps given to Colin by
text: Olivier, or perhaps "borrowed" as a souvenir and long since
dialog: forgotten.
text: We see MARILYN dancing happily, exaggerating off camera,
text: looking playful and sexy. She is radiant and full of life.
text: After a moment she turns and looks off camera - perhaps to
text: where Colin himself would have been standing - and winks
dialog: happily.
text: Blown up to the full size of the screen it is utterly sweet
dialog: and charming.
dialog: There is something so completely natural about the gesture
text: COLIN feels he has been swept back seven years in time and
text: MARILYN is standing in front of him again, in the flesh. It
text: moves and delights him; perhaps he has never even really seen
dialog: this clip before. At any rate he hasn't thought about it for
dialog: years.
text: It is MARILYN as he will always remember her, relaxed,
text: affectionate and vital, a part of her, however tiny, forever
dialog: his.
text: She smiles, laughs at something, giggles in delight (without
text: sound). She says something to an unseen crew member, then
text: looks back, smiling at the camera.
text: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 120.
dialog: 
text: Her face fills the screen.
dialog: Beautiful, timeless -
dialog: Happy.
dialog: HOLD on the image for as long as we dare, then -
text: FADE TO BLACK.
