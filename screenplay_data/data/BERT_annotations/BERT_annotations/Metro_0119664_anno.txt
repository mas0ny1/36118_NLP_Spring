scene_heading: CLOSEUP OF SCOTT ROPER
text: He's listening to the stretch call of a horse race, and he's
dialog: into it.
speaker_heading: TRACK ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
dialog: ...at the top of the stretch it's
text: Cozy Girl in front with Backtrack
text: coming on... Cozy Girl by a length,
dialog: Backtrack closing...
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Come on. Stay up there, Cozy Girl...
text: The CAMERA GRADUALLY pulls back to reveal that Roper is
text: driving his Trans Am across the Bay Bridge. HELICOPTER SHOTS
text: give a soaring view of the San Francisco skyline.
speaker_heading: TRACK ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
text: At the eighth pole it's Cozy Girl by
dialog: half a length... Backtrack closing...
scene_heading: INT. CAR - DAY
text: Roper's police radio SQUAWKS.
speaker_heading: DISPATCHER (V.O.)
dialog: One-one-four to Roper.
text: He picks up the radio.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Dig in, Cozy Girl...
dialog: (into the radio)
dialog: Roper go.
speaker_heading: DISPATCHER (V.O.)
scene_heading: One-four, Roper. Code 2.C.P. 4th and
dialog: Grand.
speaker_heading: TRACK ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
dialog: It's Cozy Girl holding on... Cozy
dialog: Girl and Backtrack...
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: I'm en route. E.T.A. in five.
text: He tosses the radio down. Punches the accelerator.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Stay up there, Girl...
speaker_heading: TRACK ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
text: Cozy Girl in front by a neck... Now
dialog: a head...
scene_heading: EXT. TRANS AM - DAY
text: Weaving through traffic on the bridge.
speaker_heading: ROPER (V.O.)
dialog: Where's the damn wire?!
speaker_heading: TRACK ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
dialog: Here comes the wire... and...
text: Backtrack gets up in the last jump.
dialog: Cozy girl a very game second.
speaker_heading: ROPER (V.O.)
dialog: SHIT!
text: The Trans Am streak off toward the city.
scene_heading: EXT. BANK - DOWNTOWN - DAY
text: A hostage situation. Police barricades. Dozens of squad cars,
text: ambulances, spectators, SWAT team. It's a stalemate. Roper's
text: Trans Am pulls to a stop at the barricades. He hops out,
text: weaves through the spectators and past the barriers.
text: A FEMALE DETECTIVE, EIKO KIMURA, rushes up to him.
speaker_heading: KIMURA
dialog: Hi, Roper.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Hi, Kimura. Where's the command post?
text: Kimura points to the diner in the middle of the block. Roper
text: heads toward it. As they walk Kimura briefs him...
speaker_heading: KIMURA
text: The suspect came in shortly after
text: the bank opened. Botched robbery. A
text: teller hit the silent alarm. He took
text: seven hostages. Shot one -- the guard.
text: He's still alive. So far he's asked
dialog: for...
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: ...a car.
speaker_heading: KIMURA
text: That's right, and a plane waiting at
dialog: the airport. If he doesn't...
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: ...get 'em, he's going to start
dialog: shooting hostages in five minutes...
speaker_heading: KIMURA
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: What's the suspect's name?
speaker_heading: KIMURA
dialog: Earl.
scene_heading: INT. DINER - DAY
text: Across from the bank. This is where the "command post" is
text: setup. About a dozen cops and the accompanying support staff
text: are here. Lieutenant SAMUEL BAFFERT is in charge. Roper
text: saunters in.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Hello, guys.
speaker_heading: BAFFERT
dialog: Hello, Roper. Glad you could join
dialog: us.
text: Roper walks over to the counter where Baffert is standing.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Do we have a profile on Mr. Earl?
text: Baffert hands him a folder. Roper opens it.
speaker_heading: BAFFERT
dialog: This guy is no genius.
text: Roper scans the profile.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: They're not usually graduate students.
speaker_heading: BAFFERT
text: SWAT wants to go in.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: What's the rush? They haven't killed
dialog: anybody yet this week?
text: Roper refers to the folder.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: We got a guy who's probably on drugs.
dialog: He's got a record of 459's and he
dialog: was busted on possession. But he's
dialog: never been busted on a major felony.
dialog: What's his demeanor?
speaker_heading: KIMURA
dialog: Well he's a little fucking agitated --
text: he ripped the phone out.
speaker_heading: ROPER
text: I have to go face to face.
speaker_heading: BAFFERT
dialog: No -- you can't do that.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: You got 7 hostages in there, 1 of
dialog: them's wounded -- We don't know how
dialog: bad it is -- The guy ripped the phone
dialog: out -- SWAT said he's got a gun to
text: the head of a female hostage. If
dialog: SWAT makes entry now, you're gonna
dialog: lose 1 hostage, maybe 2. I gotta go
dialog: in. Maybe I can see what's going on
dialog: in there.
speaker_heading: BAFFERT
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: He's never offed anybody. His rap
text: doesn't show any violence.
speaker_heading: BAFFERT
dialog: Not that we know of.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: We don't know how much time we have.
dialog: If I can get in to talk to him --
dialog: maybe we won't lose anyone.
speaker_heading: BAFFERT
dialog: Maybe we can get a throw phone in
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: KIMURA
dialog: SWAT says it's broken -- The perp in
dialog: the last situation rendered it
dialog: inoperable.
speaker_heading: BAFFERT
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: KIMURA
text: He urinated on it and shorted out
dialog: the circuits.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: We gonna stand here and talk about
dialog: it or let the guy in there bleed to
dialog: death.
dialog: (beat... beat)
dialog: Give me a dozen donuts.
text: Roper pulls out his gun and places it on the counter.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY
text: Roper eats the donut as he crosses toward the bank.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP ACROSS THE STREET - DAY
text: A team of two SWAT TEAM MEMBERS, FORBES IS A SPOTTER AND
text: MCCALL IS A SHARPSHOOTER. KEVIN MCCALL, is the one we're
text: interested in. He's 25 years old, handsome, all American.
dialog: He's the best the SWAT team has.
text: He crouches motionless, staring through the scope of his
text: rifle, watching as Roper calmly walks toward the bank.
speaker_heading: FORBES
dialog: What do you think he's got in the
dialog: bag?
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Donuts.
speaker_heading: FORBES
dialog: You can't take a guy down with a
dialog: donut.
scene_heading: INT. BANK - DAY
text: A tense situation. A wild-eyed, white punk, fuck-up of a
text: BANK ROBBER, EARL, is holding a pretty, young TELLER around
text: the neck with a cocked gun held to her temple.
text: The other bank employees are cowering on the floor. A few
text: are giving aid to the wounded bank guard who is half-conscious
text: and oozing blood from his side.
text: Roper strolls right through the front door and walks toward
dialog: Earl, very sociable.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Hi, Earl, I'm Scott Roper. Wanna
dialog: donut? I ate the glazed but there's
dialog: a bunch of chocolate and a --
text: Earl swipes the donuts out of Roper's hand and starts frisking
text: Roper for weapons with his free hand. The other hand still
text: has the gun poised at the young teller's head.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: I'm a negotiator, Earl. I don't carry
text: a weapon.
text: Roper smiles reassuringly at the pretty teller. It seems to
text: help. Earl finishes patting Roper down, straightens back up
text: and puts his hand around the teller's neck.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Where's the car?
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: I need to get something straight
dialog: first.
text: Roper looks over at the other bank employees huddled on the
dialog: floor.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Who's the manager?
text: A balding, middle-aged MAN sheepishly raises his hand.
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: I am.
text: Roper takes a step toward him.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: When did you start keeping longer
dialog: hours?
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: Last spring.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Really! Because I've been thinking
dialog: of moving to this branch. It would
dialog: be really convenient for me --
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: HEY, SHUT UP!
text: Earl wags his gun against the Teller's ear.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Do you want me to start killing
dialog: people?!
text: Roper holds his hand up defensively.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: It's my job to see that no one gets
dialog: killed, Earl... Including you.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Then where's my FUCKING car!
text: Earl is pouring sweat. His gun hand is shaking uncontrollably.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: I'm getting it, Earl, but we have to
dialog: do this the right way.
text: Roper keeps his eyes locked on Earl. His voice is calm.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: First I need you to point that gun
dialog: away from --
dialog: (to the teller)
dialog: What's your name?
speaker_heading: TELLER
dialog: (voice trembling)
dialog: Debbie...
speaker_heading: ROPER
text: Point the gun away from Debbie.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Debbie's brains are going to be
dialog: splattered all over the floor if I
dialog: don't see a car in five minutes!
text: Roper takes a long look at Earl. The guy is a hair trigger.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Alright! But let's be clear about
dialog: one thing. If you kill someone, I
dialog: can't help you. The SWAT guys will
dialog: take you out.
text: Earl glances at the army of cop cars poised outside. Reflects
text: for a moment on the reality of the situation.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: What are my chances of getting out
dialog: of here?
text: Roper calmly moves toward where the wounded guard is laying.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Not bad. Last month, a guy robbed a
dialog: bank in Daly City...
text: Roper crouches down, smiles at the blurry-eyed guard.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: How ya doin'?
text: The guard groans. He's not doing very well. Roper peels back
text: the bloody handkerchief, takes a look. Winces.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: (to Earl)
text: ...Cops gave him a car, and he lost
text: them on the freeway.
text: Earl is encouraged by that.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Absolutely. Bank robbers are generally
dialog: your smartest criminals.
text: Roper looks directly into Earl's eyes.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: He didn't kill anybody, though.
text: Roper bends over the guard.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: This is gonna hurt.
text: He grabs the guard under the arms and starts dragging him
text: across the floor. The guard MOANS piteously.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Hey, leave him alone. What are you
dialog: doing?
text: Roper keeps dragging the guard toward the front door.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: It's part of my negotiator's oath.
dialog: If there's an injured party and I
dialog: can help them, I'm duty bound by my
dialog: oath to do that. You can shoot me if
dialog: you want, but the next negotiator in
dialog: here is going to tell you the same
dialog: thing.
text: Earl is unsure what to do, but he guesses an oath is an oath.
text: He lets Roper drag the guard to the door.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: I'll be right back, Earl. Point that
text: gun away from Debbie.
text: Earl compliantly moves the gun away from the teller's head,
text: then re-thinks and jerks it back against her temple.
scene_heading: EXT. BANK - DAY
text: Roper drags the guard out the front door and deposits him on
text: the sidewalk. Two SWAT OFFICERS rush up to give aid. One of
dialog: them is Jennings.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: (whispering to Jennings)
dialog: Give me your gun.
dialog: (NOTE: The method of disarming Earl is still to be determined)
text: Jennings inconspicuously pulls his gun out and slips it to
text: him. Roper quickly cocks it and shoves it in his waistband
text: under his shirt and vest.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: I haven't had to shoot anyone in
dialog: three years.
speaker_heading: JENNINGS
dialog: Why not keep the streak alive?
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Because this strung-out junkie is
dialog: too stupid to get out of this without
dialog: killing somebody.
scene_heading: INT. BANK - DAY
text: Earl watches Roper through the window. He can only see Roper's
text: back. He's getting very agitated.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: (yelling)
text: HEY, WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING OUT
dialog: THERE!
text: The two cops hustle off with the wounded guard, and Roper
text: calmly walks back into the bank. Stops about five paces from
dialog: Earl.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: As a rule, I need one hostage released
dialog: as show of good faith.
text: Roper glances at Debbie. Gun pressed against her head. Tears
text: start rolling down her cheeks. She's being tremendously brave.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Give me Debbie.
text: Earl squeezes the gun even tighter against the side of her
dialog: head.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Take the old guy.
text: The other hostages watch this exchange tensely.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: The Old Guy? What kind of show of
dialog: faith is that? I want Debbie.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Am I gettin' the car?
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: You're gettin' the car.
text: Earl thinks about it, his gun hand twitching. He points at
text: two of the female employees cowering against the counter.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Take them.
text: Roper decides that this is the best he's going to get.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: You two, leave.
text: The two women don't need any extra encouragement. They jump
text: up and rush out the front door.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY
text: McCall and Forbes watch through their rifle scopes as the
text: two released hostages are whisked away by uniformed cops.
speaker_heading: FORBES
dialog: This guy is good.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: That's what they say.
scene_heading: INT. BANK - DAY
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: That was fine, Earl. Now I'm going
dialog: to get your car.
text: Roper turns around and walks toward the front door. He stops
text: and looks over his shoulder.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Oh, there's one last thing.
text: Earl looks like he's right on the edge.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: You want a convertible or hardtop?
text: Earl thinks about that for a beat...
speaker_heading: ROPER
text: Hardtop.
text: Roper turns around, starts walking again. He keeps his eyes
text: focused on the reflection of Earl in the front window of the
dialog: bank.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: (without turning around)
dialog: Manual or automatic?
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Automatic.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: You got it.
text: In one swift motion, Roper turns, aims and FIRES!...
text: One SHOT. It tears into Earl's shoulder. One inch from
text: Debbie's neck. Earl is blown back against the counter. Debbie
text: shrieks at the top of her lungs.
text: SWAT guys pour in from every entrance. YELLING for everybody
text: to "GET DOWN"! Pointing guns. They pounce on Earl.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: I give up! I give up!
text: Roper goes to Debbie, puts his arm around her and gently
text: leads her out of the bank.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY
text: McCall and Forbes still have their rifles trained on the
text: bank door. Their police radio squawks...
speaker_heading: RADIO
text: The situation is secured. Suspect in
text: custody. Repeat. Situation secured.
text: McCall lowers his rifle as Roper guides Debbie through the
text: wave of cops rushing into the bank.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - SHORT TIME LATER
text: Roper is exiting the bank and putting back on his gun when
text: he hears the sound of a CAMERA SHUTTER. He turns to see
text: VERONICA (RONNIE) TATE holding the camera. She snaps one of
text: Roper with Earl in the b.g. being placed in a squad car.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
text: There's one for the front page.
text: Roper puts his hand over his heart as if stricken with love...
text: which he in fact is.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Ronnie, why are you torturing me? I
dialog: can't live without you.
text: Ronnie rolls her eyes. She doesn't take Roper all that
dialog: seriously.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: Don't start.
text: She slings the camera over her shoulder and starts to walk
text: off. Roper dogs her.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: This baseball player you're going
dialog: out with...
dialog: (shaking his head)
dialog: He's no good for you.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: Really?! He's a wonderful guy. He
dialog: makes two million a year, and he
dialog: worships me.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: I worship you.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: You worship yourself.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Ronnie, forget this what's-his-name.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: Greg.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Did you know he's already got a bad
dialog: knee? In another 10 years you're
text: going to be pushing him around in a
dialog: wheelchair.
text: Ronnie stops. Looks him in the eye.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: You know what I think? I think you
dialog: only want me now, because I'm with
dialog: somebody else.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Who cares what you think. I want you
dialog: back and that's all that matters.
text: Ronnie smiles, but offers no response.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Let me take you out tomorrow night...
dialog: Pleeease.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: I'm going out with Greg tomorrow.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: (frowning)
dialog: This Greg is really getting in my
dialog: way.
text: Roper gets down on his knees.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Please. I'm begging you.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: Oh, I've got to get a shot of this.
text: She takes the lense cap off her camera. Roper primps his
text: hair to make sure he looks good for the picture... CLICK!
text: Suddenly Roper notices that his Trans Am is being towed. He
text: rushes over to his car.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Hey, that's my car.
text: A REPO MAN stands off to the side watching dispassionately.
speaker_heading: REPO MAN
dialog: Not anymore. Now it belongs to Silver
dialog: Hills Financial.
text: Roper sadly watches the tow truck drive off with his beloved
dialog: Trans Am.
scene_heading: INT. METRO DIVISION HEADQUARTERS - DAY - RAINING
text: Lots of activity. Officers in cubicles; talking on phones;
text: typing reports on computers. Most are plain-clothed. Roper
text: weaves through the room. Passes by Baffert's desk.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Hey, Baffert, what's the story for
dialog: tonight?
text: Baffert pulls two tickets for the Warriors' game out of his
dialog: pocket.
speaker_heading: BAFFERT
dialog: Floor seats.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: You're my hero.
speaker_heading: BAFFERT
dialog: Dinner's on you.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Deal.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - DAY - RAINING
text: A quiet contrast to the squadroom. This is the executive
text: branch of Metro. All the big-wigs are officed here. Roper
text: walks down the carpeted hall. No one here except Kevin McCall
text: quietly sitting outside Captain Solis' office. Roper and
text: McCall make brief eye contact. Roper thinks nothing of it.
text: He goes into the Captain's office.
scene_heading: INT. CAPTAIN SOLIS' OFFICE - RAINING
text: CAPTAIN FRANK SOLIS is on the phone. There's a file on the
text: desk in front of him. He motions Roper to sit down.
speaker_heading: SOLIS
dialog: He just walked into my office.
dialog: (looks over at Roper)
dialog: The Chief says, "Good work this
dialog: morning. Congratulations."
text: Roper smiles as he sits down.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Tell him to give me a raise.
speaker_heading: SOLIS
dialog: (into the phone)
dialog: He says, "Thank you very much."
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: I'll discuss it with him right now...
dialog: Good-bye, Chief.
text: Solis hangs up. Looks across the desk at Roper. A long pause.
dialog: He knows he's got leverage.
speaker_heading: SOLIS
dialog: Roper.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SOLIS
dialog: Are you going to make this hard for
dialog: me?
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Depends. What's up?
speaker_heading: SOLIS
dialog: There's been some concern about you
text: continuing to work without back-up.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Define concern.
text: Solis dumps his cards on the table.
speaker_heading: SOLIS
dialog: What if you die and no one can do
dialog: what you do as well as you do it?
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Your concern is heartwarming.
speaker_heading: SOLIS
dialog: It's been decided that you take on
dialog: another partner and train him to be
dialog: able to take over for you.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Is that what the guy in the Sunday
dialog: School suit is doing outside?
speaker_heading: SOLIS
dialog: His name's Kevin McCall. Every Metro
dialog: Captain agrees that he's their top
dialog: sharp-shooter and most likely to
dialog: succeed.
text: Roper grabs McCall's folder off the desk.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Let me see that.
text: Roper scans it.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Tested high on his intellectual
dialog: aptitude... Not as high as me but...
dialog: National marksman finalist... Attended
dialog: N. Y. C... Went to college. Very
dialog: impressive. F.B.I. sniper school...
dialog: Mayorial commendation.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - SAME - RAINING
text: McCall turns around in his chair. He can see Roper and Solis
text: through the glass walls of the office, but he can't hear
text: their voices.
scene_heading: INT. SOLIS' OFFICE - SAME - RAINING
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: "Additional Skills": Biathelete,
text: marathoner, lip-reading, speaks
dialog: Spanish...
text: Roper throws the folder back on the desk.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Great, send him to the Marines. This
dialog: guy's not a negotiator. He'll quit
dialog: in two weeks.
speaker_heading: SOLIS
dialog: You let us worry about that.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Is there going to be an expression
dialog: of your appreciation?
speaker_heading: SOLIS
dialog: (gloomily)
dialog: What kind of appreciation are we
dialog: talking about?
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: The financial kind. I figure I'm
dialog: going to be working extra hours. All
dialog: sorts of overtime... training
dialog: sessions... Not to mention the extra
dialog: stress...
speaker_heading: SOLIS
dialog: What do you think would be in order?
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Like ahh... I don't know...
dialog: (boldly)
dialog: Five thousand dollars.
speaker_heading: SOLIS
dialog: (calmly)
dialog: Okay, I think I could swing that.
dialog: Uh-oh, Roper thinks maybe he sold short.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: (quickly)
text: And a car.
speaker_heading: SOLIS
dialog: Hey, you just got a five thousand
dialog: dollar raise. Get a car of your own.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: You know you've got nothing but cars
text: down there in impound.
speaker_heading: SOLIS
dialog: Impound isn't a rent-a-car company.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: (firmly)
text: The car is part of the deal.
speaker_heading: SOLIS
dialog: What happened to your Trans Am?
text: Solis gets up and taps the glass, motions for McCall to come
dialog: in.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Repoed this morning.
speaker_heading: SOLIS
dialog: (relenting)
dialog: I'll provide you with transportation.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: And even if this doesn't work, I
dialog: want all the money. These SWAT guys
dialog: don't have the temperament. They
dialog: don't have the background...
text: McCall enters the office.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: (instant character
dialog: change)
dialog: Hey, glad to meet you. I've heard
dialog: nothing but good things about you...
text: Roper reaches out. They shake hands.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Same here. I've watched you in action.
dialog: Very impressive.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: You've got a lot of hard work ahead
dialog: of you if you want to be a negotiator.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: I'm ready to do it.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: And I'm going to be here more than
dialog: two weeks.
text: Roper's face darkens.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Don't go reading my lips, man. That's
dialog: an intrusion. Save that shit for the
dialog: sniper school. Comprende?
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Sorry... Habit.
speaker_heading: SOLIS
dialog: (intervening)
dialog: Let's move past this, gentlemen.
text: Roper smiles.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: We're already past it, aren't we,
dialog: Kevin?
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: If you say so.
speaker_heading: SOLIS
dialog: Then you'll have to excuse me. I
dialog: have other work to do.
text: Roper and McCall head out the door.
speaker_heading: SOLIS
dialog: Roper...
text: Roper turns back around.
speaker_heading: SOLIS
dialog: About the transportation issue...
dialog: You check with the impound sergeant.
text: Roper smiles. Total victory.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - DAY - RAINING
text: MOVING with Roper and McCall.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: You ever been in a hostage situation?
speaker_heading: MCCALL
text: Only at the very end.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: How do you feel after a shooting.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: (self-assured)
dialog: Like it had to be done.
text: They enter the squadroom, wind through the cubicles.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: It rarely has to be done.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: I've rarely shot anyone.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: SWAT is a lifesaving unit, you know.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: (flatly)
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Try to remember that.
text: They arrive at Roper's desk.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Okay, "Dead Eye", lesson one...
text: Roper grabs an empty soda bottle from a neighboring desk. He
text: takes the cap off a ball point pen and drops it into the
text: empty bottle. He places the bottle on his desk.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Extract that pen cap without touching
dialog: or moving the bottle.
text: McCall looks at the bottle quizzically.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: What's the point of this?
speaker_heading: ROPER
text: A little exercise in lateral thinking.
dialog: The obvious solution isn't always
dialog: the only solution... See you tomorrow.
text: Roper grabs his jacket and walks off, leaving McCall to ponder
text: the problem. McCall looks over at another cop who has been
text: observing. The cop shrugs his shoulders. He hasn't got a
text: clue. McCall sits down and thoughtfully peers into the bottle.

text: Roper is holding the keys in his hand.
speaker_heading: BAFFERT
dialog: Mind if we make a stop on the way?
dialog: We busted Frank Antonucci on
dialog: possession. He gave us a lead on
dialog: that Polk Street jewelry heist.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: "Phoney Frank"? Don't waste your
dialog: time. He'd tell you his granny was
dialog: in on the Kennedy assassination if
text: he could dodge a collar.
speaker_heading: BAFFERT
dialog: I still gotta do it. Wasting time is
dialog: half my job.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Yeah, okay.
text: Roper is looking at the numbered parking spaces.
speaker_heading: BAFFERT
dialog: This SWAT guy might be a good idea.
dialog: He may be able to take a little
dialog: pressure off you. I worry about you.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: You worried about me, too? The chief's
dialog: worried about me. Solis is worried
dialog: about me. Maybe you guys should start
dialog: some kind of organization.
speaker_heading: BAFFERT
dialog: Speaking of which. I saw you talking
dialog: to Ronnie this morning. Why can't
dialog: you get it back together with her.
dialog: You've gotta be out of your mind not
dialog: to get with that one.
speaker_heading: ROPER
text: It's not me. It's her. She's going
dialog: out with this baseball player --
dialog: Greg Barnett.
speaker_heading: BAFFERT
dialog: (impressed)
dialog: No shit! He's good!
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Fuck him. He swings at anything in
dialog: the dirt. I could strike him out.
speaker_heading: BAFFERT
dialog: Don't give up on her. You're getting
dialog: to the age when you ought to be
dialog: thinking about these things.
text: Roper bends over like an old man.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Yep, my rheumatism's been acting up.
text: They arrive at their destination. A parking space with a
scene_heading: 1957 DODGE PICKUP.
speaker_heading: BAFFERT
dialog: This is it. Space 742.
text: Roper looks at the pickup truck in disbelief.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Then he didn't say 742. He must have
dialog: said 724 or something, because this
dialog: can't be right.
text: Baffert unlocks the pickup and offers the keys to Roper who
text: is crossing to the truck.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Oh man! What am I, Red Foxx? I'm not
dialog: riding in this shit. I can't roll in
dialog: no shit like this.
text: He takes the keys from Baffert who moves around to the
text: passengers side. He opens the door.
speaker_heading: BAFFERT
dialog: Where's the stereo?
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Fuck the stereo. What's that smell?
speaker_heading: BAFFERT
dialog: Come on. Just get in. We gotta go.

speaker_heading: BAFFERT
dialog: Apartment 306.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: You want me to go up with you?
speaker_heading: BAFFERT
dialog: Nah, It probably won't turn up
dialog: anything. I'm just gonna talk to
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Good. I don't want to be late.
text: Baffert gets out. Roper grabs his cell phone.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: You want anything on the game?
text: Baffert turns back around.
speaker_heading: BAFFERT
dialog: What's the line?
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.
speaker_heading: BAFFERT
dialog: I'll take half of your action.
text: Baffert goes into the building. Roper dials his cellular
dialog: phone. Beep! Beep!
speaker_heading: DETAIL SHOT
text: A message on the display reads: RECHARGE BATTERY.
text: Roper looks around. There's a payphone across the street. He
text: gets out of the truck and crosses to it.
scene_heading: INT. BUILDING - NIGHT
text: Third floor hallway. Nice, middle class place. Well kept up.
text: Baffert walks over to room 306. Knocks.
scene_heading: INT. KORDA'S APT. - NIGHT
text: Jazz is playing. MICHAEL KORDA sits motionless in a chair
text: listening to the music. There's a KNOCK. Korda responds as
text: if pulled from a trance. He rises and moves to the door.
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: Who is it?
speaker_heading: BAFFERT (V.O.)
dialog: It's Lieutenant Sam Baffert from the
dialog: San Francisco Police Department.
text: A slight hesitation from Korda. He glances around the
dialog: apartment. For what reason, we don't know. Maybe to make
text: sure there's nothing incriminating around. He opens the door.
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: What happened? Is there a problem?
speaker_heading: BAFFERT
dialog: May I come in? I would just like to
dialog: ask you a couple of questions.
text: Korda steps aside and lets Baffert enter. Korda closes the
text: door. Baffert scans the place. Not bad. He listens to the
text: music. A smile grows on his face.
speaker_heading: BAFFERT
dialog: Count Basie?
text: Korda smiles back. Another jazz aficionada.
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: Duke Ellington. "Things Ain't What
dialog: They Used To Be", recorded July 30,
dialog: 1945.
speaker_heading: BAFFERT
dialog: Yeah... Yeah... Now I can hear it.
text: Korda goes to the stereo, turns it down. Duke Ellington plays
dialog: low.
speaker_heading: BAFFERT
dialog: Where did you find an old recording
dialog: like that?
speaker_heading: KORDA
text: Used record shop down on Turk Street.
dialog: I was in there looking for some Robert
dialog: Johnson.
dialog: (searching for the
dialog: name)
dialog: Memories... Memory Lane or
dialog: something...
speaker_heading: BAFFERT
dialog: I've got to stop in there... Mr.
dialog: Korda, do you know Frank Antonucci?
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: You mean Frank who owns the bakery
dialog: down the street?
text: Baffert smiles.
speaker_heading: BAFFERT
dialog: No, this is a different Frank. This
text: is a man who deals in jewelry. Stolen
dialog: jewelry usually. You wouldn't know
dialog: anybody like that?
text: Korda drifts to the other side of the room. Takes a look out
dialog: his front window...
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: Nobody there. Just the truck.
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: I certainly wouldn't.
text: He says it as if the very idea disturbs him. He turns away
text: from the window. Baffert feigns a coughing spell.
speaker_heading: BAFFERT
dialog: Could I please have a little water?
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: (the perfect host)
dialog: Of course.
text: Korda heads toward the kitchen area. Baffert uses this as an
text: opportunity to drift around the room. Do a little snooping.
speaker_heading: BAFFERT
dialog: The reason I'm asking you is because
dialog: we arrested him with some stolen
dialog: jewelry. It was traced to the robbery
text: of a store down on Polk Street. He
dialog: said he was fencing it for you.
text: Baffert notices something in the trash can.
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: Several glassine envelopes used for raw jewels. They have
text: jeweler's markings on them indicating gem weight and grade.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN
text: Korda, pouring the water, notices Baffert's discovery, but
text: his face betrays nothing.
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: (calmly)
dialog: There's obviously some mistake. I
dialog: have a cousin who has had run-ins
dialog: with the law.
text: Korda re-enters the room with the glass of water.
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: Perhaps for his own reasons he
dialog: entangled me in this... situation.
speaker_heading: BAFFERT
dialog: This cousin of yours... What's his
dialog: name?
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: (forthrightly)
dialog: Clarence Teal.
text: They look at each other a beat. Korda is still holding the
dialog: water.
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: Your cough seems to be better.
text: A real repressed tension here. Someone's about to get hurt.
text: Baffert takes the glass of water.
speaker_heading: BAFFERT
dialog: Thank you.
text: He takes a sip. Korda watches him like a cobra. Baffert puts
text: the glass down on the table.
speaker_heading: BAFFERT
dialog: Well, I'm on my way to the game. I
dialog: appreciate your cooperation, Mr.
dialog: Korda.
text: Korda smiles. Baffert walks to the door. Opens it to leave...
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: Lieutenant...
text: Baffert turns back around.
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: Do you believe that story about Robert
dialog: Johnson...? That he made a deal with
dialog: the devil at the crossroads?
text: Baffert muses along with Korda.
speaker_heading: BAFFERT
dialog: Could be.
text: Baffert moves off down the hall and Korda closes his door.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Baffert gets into the elevator.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT
text: Baffert takes out his cell phone. Dials.
speaker_heading: BAFFERT
dialog: (as the elevator
dialog: descends)
dialog: Hello, Judge Stone... This is
dialog: Lieutenant Samuel Baffert. I'm at a
dialog: suspect's residence. I'm requesting
text: a telephonic search warrant in
dialog: connection with an armed robbery at
text: a jewelry store. There's visible
dialog: evidence on the premises. Glassine
text: envelopes with jeweler's markings
dialog: were seen in the trash can...
text: The elevator hits the first floor.
speaker_heading: BAFFERT
dialog: ...I believe a full search of the
dialog: premises will turn up some stolen
dialog: property...
text: The elevator opens.
text: Korda is standing there with a knife.
text: Baffert has no time to react...
text: The knife hand slashes forward... Stabbing the chest and
text: slashing across the throat.
scene_heading: EXT. BUILDING - NIGHT
text: Korda calmly exits the building as Roper crosses the street,
text: returning from the payphone. Neither of the men take any
text: particular notices of each other. A WOMAN carrying her
text: groceries enters the building.
text: Roper gets to the truck. A SCREAM from inside the building.
scene_heading: INT. BUILDING - NIGHT
text: Baffert is laying in the open elevator, knife wounds to his
text: neck and chest. Roper rushes over to him. It doesn't look
dialog: good.
text: The woman with the groceries is standing halfway up the first
text: flight of stairs. Frozen. Roper pulls out his gun and rushes
text: by her up the stairs.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: (to the woman)
dialog: Get an ambulance!
scene_heading: INT. THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Roper arrives at the top of the stairs. Korda's door is ajar.
text: Duke Ellington can be heard faintly.
scene_heading: INT. KORDA'S APT. - NIGHT
text: Roper nudges the door open, takes a step inside, gun ready...
text: No one there. Suddenly, from the hallway, the click of a
text: door. Roper races out.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Roper sprints to the door at the end of the hall, KICKS it
text: open. Gun aimed.
scene_heading: INT. APT. 302 - NIGHT
text: A five year old stares up at him. Scared stiff. Roper holds
text: up a reassuring hand, and, as quickly as he arrived, he
dialog: leaves.
scene_heading: EXT. BUILDING - NIGHT
text: Roper burst out the front. Down the stairs to the sidewalk.
text: Looks both ways down the street... Realizes in dismay that
text: Korda is long gone. A SIREN approaches.
scene_heading: INT. SOLIS OFFICE - NIGHT - RAIN
text: Angle outside window to Roper sitting in a chair by the window
text: looking out to the rain. Solis is in the b.g. on the phone.
speaker_heading: SOLIS
dialog: (on the phone)
dialog: Yes sir. Every resource will be
dialog: brought to bear. We will find this
dialog: guy... Yeah, he's here now. I'll
dialog: tell him.
text: Solis hangs up the phone.
speaker_heading: SOLIS
dialog: The chief says to tell you how sorry
dialog: he is. He knew Sam Baffert was a
dialog: good man.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: (still looking out
dialog: window)
dialog: He said he was just going up to talk
dialog: to him. He said...
dialog: (beat; turning to
dialog: Solis)
dialog: I want to be put on this case.
speaker_heading: SOLIS
dialog: I can't do that.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: (emphatic)
dialog: I want to be put on this case.
speaker_heading: SOLIS
dialog: You know I can't assign you to this.
dialog: You're much too close to it. You
dialog: were much too close to Sam. The
dialog: department will take care of it.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Who's running it?
speaker_heading: SOLIS
dialog: Roper...
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Who's running it!
speaker_heading: SOLIS
dialog: Kimura and Glass will head the
dialog: investigation.
text: Roper turns to leave.
speaker_heading: SOLIS
dialog: Scott. Go home. Get some sleep.
text: Roper pauses at the door. Then pulls out two basketball
text: tickets and lays them on the table in Solis' office. He exits.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. METRO OFFICE AREA - NIGHT
text: Two detectives. A female named KIMURA and a tall guy named
text: GLASS, try to make a getaway as they see Roper coming.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Hey, hey, hey...
text: Roper intercepts them.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Anything on Korda so far?
speaker_heading: KIMURA
dialog: Solis said to keep you clear of this.
text: Roper responds louder than necessary with a half turn toward
text: Solis' hallway.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: I don't give a damn what Solis said.
dialog: (to the detectives)
dialog: If you get a lead, I want to know.

scene_heading: EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET - NIGHT - RAINING
text: Roper's pickup drives by.
scene_heading: INT. PICKUP
text: Thru the windshield. We see Roper as the windshield wipers
text: flap back and forth. His face seems dazed and lost.
scene_heading: INT. RONNIE'S HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Roper knocks. Ronnie's cheerful voice can be heard.
speaker_heading: RONNIE (O.S.)
dialog: Just a minute.
text: Roper makes no effort to pull himself together. The door
text: opens and Ronnie's face registers surprise. She's dressed
text: casually in jeans, a nice shirt, but wears make-up and
text: earrings.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Hey yourself. Came by to see Troy.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: (like hell)
dialog: A little late for that, Scottie.
text: He's asleep.
dialog: (smells his breath)
dialog: Jack Daniels?
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: I'm not drunk. Yet.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: Maybe you should be.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: You heard.
text: She nods, sympathetic, but doesn't leave the doorway.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: Yeah. I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Can I come in?
text: Ronnie opens the door reluctantly.
scene_heading: INT. RONNIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Roper enters. Instantly we see he's at home here. He hangs
text: his coat in the closet, puts his keys on the table, notices
text: a photograph on the wall. Quite imposing. Very unique style.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: That a new picture?
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: About 4 months old. I'm working in a
dialog: new style.
text: Roper gazes at it indifferently. He falls silent. Thoughts
text: turned inward. Suddenly, TROY, (the dog), bounds in. He's
text: ecstatic to see Roper. He puts his front paws on the couch
text: and his head in Roper's lap.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Hey, Troy. How ya doin' boy?
dialog: (to Ronnie)
dialog: He heard my voice.
text: Roper smiles briefly, pats the dog, taking comfort from his
text: presence. His words are light. His tone isn't.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: How's the good dog. I miss you buddy.
dialog: You miss me?
text: Ronnie watches them, suddenly showing the sadness she's
text: carefully buried.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: He misses me.
text: She nods. A moment's silence.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: I won't stay long. I had to talk to
dialog: someone.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: (a bit surprised at
dialog: his openness)
dialog: You don't usually talk to anyone
dialog: when you're hurting.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: It was my fault. I was right
dialog: downstairs. I should have gone up
dialog: with him.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: Scott, You can't save everyone.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: I've proved that, didn't I?
text: She's not coming closer. She wants to, but she won't do it.
text: She seems uneasy, glances towards the door. Roper rises.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: (gentle)
dialog: What do you want from me?
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Something I guess I can't have
dialog: anymore.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: Don't try to make me feel guilty.
dialog: The whole time we were together, you
dialog: went out of your way to prove you
dialog: didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for
dialog: one night, you need me again. I can't
dialog: do it. I can't be more than your
dialog: friend. Because I know what will
dialog: happen. In a few weeks you'll be
dialog: back on top, and you'll shut me out
dialog: just as soon as you don't need me
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: (surprised, hurt)
dialog: You think I didn't need you?
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: If you did, you never showed it.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Ronnie...
text: He reaches for her and she looks like she might give in to
text: him, but at that moment there's a KNOCK ON THE DOOR. Ronnie
text: pulls back, confused and guilty.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: You expecting someone?
text: Her silence is the answer... A flash of pain from Roper.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: This day just keeps getting better.
text: Ronnie watches as he searches for his keys in his pockets.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: (soft)
dialog: They're on the table where you always
dialog: leave them.
text: He grabs the keys as she opens the door. GREG stands outside
text: waiting. He's a big, good looking guy with a smile on his
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Hey, baby, I thought maybe you were...
text: Greg's smile fades as he sees Roper.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: I was just leaving.
text: Roper strides past Greg who remains in the doorway. Ronnie
text: makes brief eye contact with Greg, but then moves past him
text: to follow Roper. She calls after him.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: Scottie... take care of yourself.
text: Roper doesn't look back. He just goes.
scene_heading: EXT. PIER 26 - EARLY MORNING
text: A huge warehouse. Sun coming up over the East Bay, CLARENCE
text: TEAL rides up on a HARLEY MOTORCYLE, carrying a large cup of
text: coffee to go. He enters the warehouse.
scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE - SAME
text: Car and Boat parts stacked in aisles ten feet high. Clarence
text: shuffles through to his watchman's quarters which are
text: connected to the end of the warehouse.
scene_heading: INT. WATCHMAN'S QUARTERS - SAME
text: Built on pilings with a panoramic view of the bay. Korda is
text: waiting behind the door as Clarence enters. He seizes Clarence
text: from behind and slams him against the wall and spins him
text: around. Hot coffee soaks the front of Clarence's shirt.
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: If you weren't family I'd kill you.
text: Clarence is scared. He offers no defense.
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: You told Antonucci that shit came
dialog: from me.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: So that we could get the best price.
dialog: He's got respect for you. He's gonna
dialog: try to lowball me, Mike.
text: Korda tosses Clarence down onto the cot.
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: You fucking idiot! Why do you think
dialog: I use you?... To be a walking
dialog: advertisement.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: I'm sorry, Mike. I never heard of
text: LaMarra flipping on anyone before.
dialog: He said he had the cops paid off.
dialog: Antonucci never flipped on anyone
dialog: before. He had the cops paid off.
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: Not the fucking cop that showed up
dialog: at my door!
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: What happened, Mike.
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: You don't want to know.
text: Tears start to come to Clarence's eyes.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: I'm sorry, Mike.
text: Clarence sincerely feels bad. It's kind of touching in a
text: twisted way. Korda moves over to the window to keep from
text: striking Clarence again. He looks off across the bay.
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: God damn it! I still needed to case
dialog: that fucking store. It's too risky
dialog: to show my face now.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: I got a couple thousand bucks. You
dialog: could leave town.
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: Leave town? They're going to know me
dialog: in fucking Des Moines now!...
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: They got over ten million in jewels
dialog: in that place. That's freedom, man.
dialog: I could go anywhere I want.
text: Clarence watches Korda warily. Things are beginning to add
text: up in his head.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: Did you kill him, Mike?
text: Korda turns to Clarence with a penetrated stare that answers
text: the question. Clarence is shaken by that. He starts to whimper
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: I'm sorry, Mike. I'm really sorry...
dialog: We're talking major fear here...
text: Korda moves to him and we think he's going to bash him around
text: again, but, surprisingly, he hugs Clarence's head against
text: his chest.
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: It's not your fault you're stupid.
text: Tears of relief from Clarence.
scene_heading: INT. METRO DIVISION HEADQUARTERS - DAY
text: Roper enters the squadroom. His mood is contained. He walks
text: to a desk where Kimura and Glass are huddling.
text: A couple desks over, McCall is reclining in Roper's chair,
dialog: reading a book entitled, "Strategies and Counter Measures in
text: Hostage Situations". On the desk in front of him is the bottle
text: with the pen cap still in it.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: (to Kimura and Glass)
dialog: What do you got on Korda?
speaker_heading: KIMURA
dialog: We ran a search on relatives. He has
dialog: a cousin in town -- Clarence Teal.
dialog: Smalltime thief. Last known address
dialog: was on Pine Street. He moved out a
dialog: month ago. We've got a couple leads
text: on him to check out.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: (rapid fire)
dialog: Did you check out DMV for any vehicles
dialog: registration?
speaker_heading: KIMURA
text: Being faxed over now.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: How about the record room for any
dialog: incident reports? He might be a
dialog: victim. We can get medical records.
dialog: Check with burglary detail and see
dialog: if anyone else knows him, knows his
dialog: habits.
speaker_heading: KIMURA
dialog: Roper...
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: And what about bars? We can talk to
dialog: neighbors to see what bars he
dialog: frequents.
speaker_heading: KIMURA
dialog: Roper, we're into it...
text: Suddenly Solis appears at their side.
speaker_heading: SOLIS
dialog: We've had this conversation once,
dialog: Roper. You're not active on this
dialog: case.
text: Roper looks at him icily.
speaker_heading: SOLIS
dialog: It's in everyone's best interest.
text: McCall, Kimura, Glass all watch this confrontation tensely.
text: After a beat, Roper gives in. Indicates his compliance. Solis
text: heads back to this office.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: (softened)
dialog: You guys are doing good work.
text: He moves toward the desk. McCall gets up when he sees him
dialog: coming.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: I'm sorry about your friend. I had a
dialog: friend in SWAT killed. I know how it
dialog: can be.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: I appreciate your concern. Let's
dialog: leave it at that.
text: McCall respectfully drops it. Roper looks down at the soda
dialog: bottle.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: I don't see much progress here.
text: McCall holds up a finger. Not so fast. He picks up a pot
text: from a nearby "Mr. Coffee" machine. It's filled with water.
text: He takes the water and slowly pours it into the bottle.
text: CLOSE ON THE BOTTLE
text: The pen cap floats to the top and McCall plucks it out without
dialog: touching or moving the bottle.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Very nice... You get an "A". Notice...
dialog: No force required. No damage.
text: Just then a SERGEANT calls to Roper across the squadroom.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: Roper, domestic disturbance at 472
dialog: 6th Street. Possible hostage
dialog: situation.
text: McCall grabs his duffel bag. Roper starts away from the desk,
text: then notices the book on "Hostage Strategies". He looks at
text: the title, then makes a demonstration of dropping it in the
text: trash can. He and McCall head out.
scene_heading: EXT. MARKET STREET - DAY
text: The pickup is weaving through traffic.
scene_heading: INT. PICKUP - DAY
dialog: Start on one of those air freshener evergreen trees hanging
text: from the rear view mirror. PULL BACK to show a police bubble
text: flashing on the dashboard.
text: Roper weaving through traffic. McCall is sitting calmly as
dialog: ever.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: So, McCall, how come you ended up in
dialog: San Francisco?
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: They recruited me. Promised me fast
dialog: advancement.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Recruited you from where?
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: National Marksman Competition.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: With your qualifications you must
dialog: have had a lot of offers. Why here?
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Furthest point I could find from New
dialog: York.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: You don't like New York?
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Spent my whole life there. I just
dialog: wanted to get out for a while.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: You'd never been out of New York?
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Been to Toronto. My mother was born
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: How did you like Toronto?
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: It was okay.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: You're a real excitable sort, aren't
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: You caught me on an "up" day.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: How about you? How did you end up in
dialog: San Francisco?
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: I grew up in Oakland... Crossed the
dialog: Bay Bridge and here I was.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: So you're looking for "fast
dialog: advancement".
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Is there something wrong with that?
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: I'm not sure.
scene_heading: EXT. 6TH STREET - DAY
text: Several Patrol Cars are parked in front of an unappealing
text: apartment building. A crowd has begun to gather. UNIFORMED
text: POLICEMEN hold them back. TWO COPS are questioning a man
text: wearing only green slacks. No shirt. No shoes. Just the
text: slacks. He is very agitated.
text: The pickup screeches up. Roper and McCall hop out. Roper
text: flashes his badge to the OFFICER in charge. (OFFICER #1)
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Roper. Metro Division. Hostage
dialog: Negotiator. Give me the short version.
speaker_heading: OFFICER #1
dialog: Husband came home. Found that guy
text: and his wife "in flagrante". Now
text: he's holding her at knife point.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Which apartment?
text: The Officer points up to the third floor.
speaker_heading: OFFICER #1
text: That one with the bars on the windows.
text: Roper nods. Walks back over to the pickup. Looks up. Eyeballs
dialog: the building.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: How are we gonna get him out of there?
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: We could fill it with water.
text: Roper throws him a look. McCall walks to the back of the
text: pickup, reaches into the cab and digs around in his duffel
dialog: bag.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: (to Officer #1)
dialog: Have you evacuated anyone?
speaker_heading: OFFICER #1
dialog: Only that floor.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Is the hostage injured?
speaker_heading: OFFICER #1
dialog: Don't know. She keeps screaming to
text: stay out. He keeps screaming to stay
dialog: out. We decided to stay out.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Well, there's a good amount of
dialog: agreement on that.
text: McCall slams the truck door, sniper rifle in hand.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: I'll take "highground" until SWAT
dialog: gets here.
dialog: (surveying the area)
dialog: I can get a good sight-line from
text: that roof across the street.
text: McCall marches off across the street.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Remember, Quick Draw, we're trying
dialog: to limit the force here.
text: McCall calls back over his shoulder.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: I know my job.
text: At that moment, a scream echoes down from the third floor
text: window. Roper heads for the front door of the building.
scene_heading: INT. APT. HALLWAY/STAIRCASE - (ACROSS THE STREET)
text: McCall bounds up the stairs of the building to the rooftop.
scene_heading: INT. 6TH ST. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - DAY
text: The screams are getting more panicky. Roper comes down the
text: hall quickly. The door to the apartment is open. It's been
text: that way since the guy in the green slacks fled. Roper hurries
text: toward the door.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT - DAY
text: The WIFE is in bra and panties and the HUSBAND is 6'4". He's
text: giving her a good beating. It's a studio apartment. Unmade
text: bed. Belongings strewn all over. Window open with sun
text: streaming in, and a good view of the building across the
text: street. We hear ROPER'S VOICE from out in the hall.
speaker_heading: ROPER (V.O.)
dialog: I'm coming in. I'm not armed.
text: The husband snatches his wife by the hair and holds a knife
text: to her throat.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: (shrieking)
dialog: No, Raymond!
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: (to Roper)
dialog: Stay the fuck out of here!
text: But Roper steps into the apartment. Sees the wife. Face
text: swollen. Knife to her neck. The enraged husband, contemplating
text: murder. One inch from committing the act. Roper doesn't bat
text: an eye.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: I know how you feel, Ray.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: You don't know shit, and I suggest
dialog: you leave.
text: He presses the knife against the wife's throat. She winces.
text: Her chest heaves.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: I can't leave, Ray. It's part of my
dialog: negotiator's oath. Once I'm in the
dialog: room with the hostage, I have to
dialog: stay.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: You don't want to see what I'm going
dialog: to do to her.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Let me show you something, Ray.
text: Roper reaches into his pocket and pulls out his wallet. He
text: extracts a photo.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP PHOTO
dialog: Wife. Two kids. A little dog-eared. Nice touch.
speaker_heading: ROPER
text: holds it up so Raymond can see it.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Same thing happened to me, man. She
dialog: cheated on me, but I forgave her.
dialog: You know why?
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: I ain't interested in your life story.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Because I was partially to blame. I
dialog: wasn't around as much as I should
dialog: have been. I forgot how to love her.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: She's the one to blame. Not me.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOF ACROSS THE STREET - ON MCCALL
text: In prone position. Rifle in hand. Eye to scope.
scene_heading: POV THROUGH SIGHT
text: of Raymond's open window.
scene_heading: INT. RAYMOND'S APARTMENT
text: Everyone where we left them. Roper looks at Ray with utter
dialog: sincerity.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Ray, think about how she looked when
dialog: you married her. Think about how
dialog: happy you were. Don't lose that,
dialog: man. Don't give up everything.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: What am I giving up? I'm laid off
dialog: last year. I'm down to my last
dialog: unemployment check. I'm out on the
dialog: streets looking for work and this
dialog: bitch is banging some asshole in my
dialog: bed.
text: And now Ray is crying. Blubbering actually. And he's not
dialog: that coherent.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: I'm down at Consolidated and I'm
dialog: begging. I'm saying I'll take half
dialog: my pay. Eight years, man. I don't
dialog: even have to work the loading docks
dialog: anymore. I'll do maintenance. "We're
dialog: cutting back. We're streamlining,
dialog: Ray. West Central's running things
dialog: now. It's out of our hands" Fuck
dialog: them! Fuck them! FUCK THEM!
dialog: (deep sigh)
dialog: I'm gonna kill her and then I'm gonna
dialog: kill myself, 'cause I don't wanna
dialog: live anymore.
text: Roper reaches out to him.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Ray, if you walk out of here with
dialog: me, I'll get you a job.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Doing what? Cleaning toilets?
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: I can't guarantee you what it will
dialog: be. But I swear on my life, I'll
dialog: find you work.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: And why the fuck would you do that
dialog: for me?
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Not for you, Ray. For me. A close
dialog: friend of mine was killed this week.
dialog: The way I figure it, I stop you from
dialog: doin' what you said, I'm one up on
dialog: body count.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Who the fuck are you, Mother Teresa?
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: My name's Scott Roper.
text: Ray stares blankly at Roper's outstretched hand, the knife
text: clutched tightly in his fist... The wife squeezes her eyes
text: closed. Everything waits for an excruciatingly long beat...
dialog: Then...
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: I need my coat.
text: It's on a coat rack in the corner. But to get there he has
text: to pass by the window. Ray drops his wife on the bed, turns
text: and goes to get his coat.
text: He crosses in front of the window... Reaches for the coat.
text: POP! A bullet slams into his skull. Ray falls to the floor.
text: The wife runs out of the room, screaming!
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: NOOOO!!
text: He rushes over to Ray. Circle of blood soaking into the
text: carpet. Ray's empty eyes. His hand still wrapped in his coat.
text: He was dead instantly. Roper slams his fist into the wall. A
text: couple of cops, guns drawn, arrive at the doorway. Roper
text: bolts out of the room... Pounds down the hallway... Pounds
text: down the stairs... down another flight...
scene_heading: EXT. APT. BLDG.
text: McCall comes across the street. Roper sees McCall, cool as
text: ever. Rifle slung over his shoulder. Roper steps into his
dialog: path.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?
text: McCall gives no answer. He pushes past Roper and continues
text: into the building.
scene_heading: INT. APT. BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY
text: Roper follows, screaming his head off.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Do you think because the police
dialog: department issued you a sniper rifle,
dialog: it makes you God! What the fuck goes
dialog: on in your head?
text: McCall, still stone-faced, reaches the apartment. Yellow
text: "crime scene" tape is being placed across the doorway. Cops
text: are tiptoeing around, surveying evidence. McCall ducks under
text: the tape. Roper follows.
scene_heading: INT. APT. - DAY
text: McCall goes over to Ray's body. Crouches down. Roper comes
text: up behind him. McCall picks up the coat covering Ray's arms.
text: Clutched in Ray's hand is a gun "Saturday night special"
text: variety. McCall looks up at Roper.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: SWAT is a lifesaving unit, remember?
dialog: I just saved a life. Yours.
text: Roper doesn't miss a beat.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: (still angry)
dialog: You think I've never had a gun pulled
dialog: on me?! You think every fucking time
dialog: someone pulls a gun they use it?!
text: McCall gets to his feet.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Eighty-five percent of domestic
dialog: disturbances of this nature end in
dialog: murder/suicide.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: (fiercely)
dialog: Not the ones I'm at.
text: McCall and Roper glare at each other. Toe to toe. A beat.
text: McCall's face softens just perceptibly.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Sorry. My mistake.
text: He walks out of the room. Roper whips the sheet off the bed,
text: contemplates the gun gripped in Ray's hand... Then tosses
text: the sheet over Ray's dead body.
scene_heading: INT. METRO DIVISION - NIGHT
text: Roper seated in the hallway, waiting outside a door marked
text: "Internal Affairs". Things are quiet. Roper stares at the
text: floor. Waiting.
text: The door opens. McCall comes out, escorted by two internal
text: affairs INVESTIGATORS. One of the investigators pats him on
dialog: the back.
speaker_heading: INVESTIGATOR
dialog: Looks like a clean shoot. Go home
dialog: and get some rest.
text: McCall shakes hands with the investigators and they disappear
text: back into the office. Roper approaches McCall. He's cooled
text: off considerably. Even a tad friendly.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Come on. Let's go for a drink.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: I don't really like to drink.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: You have to. It's a tradition.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Well, if I have to, I have to.
scene_heading: INT. BILLY GOAT TAVERN - NIGHT
text: A neighborhood bar. Roper and McCall are playing pool. Half-
text: finished beers are on a nearby table. McCall is bent over
text: the table trying to make a particularly tricky shot. Roper
text: studies him.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: You got a girlfriend?
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Why? You like my ass?
text: McCall misses the shot.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Better than your pool game.
text: Roper lines up his shot.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: You wouldn't want to put a small
dialog: wager on this, would you?
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: I don't gamble.
text: Roper smiles. Sinks his shot. Moves around the table.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Yeah, I've got a girlfriend.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: You living together?
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: She's back in Jersey... going to
dialog: graduate school.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Explain how that works.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: She's going to come here when she
dialog: graduates and then we're gonna get
dialog: married.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: She grow up in Livingtston, too?
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: (as if that were
dialog: unthinkable)
dialog: No, no, no...
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: She's from Hoboken.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Oh, "city girl". Don't you ever long
dialog: for companionship with her such a
dialog: long way away in New Jersey?
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: We see each other every couple of
dialog: months.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Every couple of months, huh?
dialog: A couple of months sounds like an awful long time to Roper.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: That's a lot of commitment. I admire
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Do you really?
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: No. Actually I think it's fucking
dialog: crazy, I don't know if I could do
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Thanks for clearing that up.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: I hear your former girlfriend is
dialog: going out with Greg Barnett.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Where did you hear that?
speaker_heading: MCCALL
text: Around. Barnett's tough competition.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Yeah, well that's a sore subject,
dialog: and therefore out of bounds to a
text: young sprout of a hostage negotiator
dialog: under my tutelage.
text: A beat and then McCall realizes that this comment is a major
text: acknowledgement of acceptance from Roper. Roper misses his
text: shot. Picks up his beer glass.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Lesson two, "Dead Eye"... should
dialog: have been lesson one. Never exchange
dialog: yourself for a hostage.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: I think I can handle that one.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Yeah, you think so, but it comes up.
text: Roper takes a drink of beer. Nears the bottom of his glass.
text: Calls to the BARTENDER.
speaker_heading: ROPER
text: Zack, another round.
text: Roper turns back to McCall.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: My partner gave himself in exchange
text: for a ten year old girl. He got caught
text: in the crossfire. Two dead. My partner
dialog: and the bad guy...
dialog: (takes the last sip)
dialog: Weird thing is, if he was alive,
dialog: he'd probably do it again.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Some people never learn.
text: Roper puts down his glass.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: You think you can learn, McCall?
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: I think so.
text: Roper nods. Maybe he can.
scene_heading: INT. ROOM - DAY
text: We're looking at a door. It's not clear where we are. McCall
text: enters. We only see his face. Determined.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: I'm Officer McCall, what's going on?
speaker_heading: REVERSE ANGLE
text: It's a training room. It's built to approximate a convenience
text: store. Several mannequins are placed around the room to
text: represent a hostage situation. The "BAD GUY" has a walkie-
text: talkie strapped around his neck. Roper's voice CRACKLES out
dialog: of it.
speaker_heading: BAD GUY
dialog: What the fuck do you think is going
dialog: on, turdhead? I'm about to waste
dialog: everyone in this place.
text: McCall hesitates, trying to figure out a response. He seems
text: stiff and awkward.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: H... how can I help you? Tell me
dialog: what...
text: (looks off to his
dialog: right)
dialog: I feel stupid talking to a dummy.
text: Roper enters the training room from a side door. He's holding
text: the other walkie-talkie.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: What did you think? I'm going to let
dialog: you practice on real people?
text: Roper comes up beside him.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: First things is, don't say, "What's
dialog: going on?" Everybody knows what's
dialog: going on. I come into this situation,
dialog: I say,
dialog: (addressing the
dialog: mannequin)
dialog: "I'm glad to see nobody's hurt. That's
dialog: good. I'm here to help you."
dialog: (turns back to McCall)
dialog: Second: You hesitated. Don't hesitate.
dialog: If you're thinking, talk while you're
dialog: thinking, or else he's going to think
dialog: you're plotting. Which you are. If
dialog: he thinks you're plotting, you're
dialog: going to make him nervous. You don't
dialog: want him nervous. Got that?
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: It'll come. Try again.
scene_heading: INT. TRAINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: ANGLE ON THE DOOR. McCall comes in. The room has the same
text: set-up. McCall takes a look around. Launches immediately
dialog: into...
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: My name's McCall. I'm a hostage
dialog: negotiator. I'm here to help you.
text: Roper's voice crackles back at him hostilely.
speaker_heading: ROPER (V.O.)
dialog: How are you going to help me?
text: McCall's confidence is growing.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Tell me what you need.
speaker_heading: ROPER (V.O.)
dialog: I need you to bring me the scumbag
dialog: who ran off with my wife so I can
text: cut off his nuts.
text: Now he's stumped.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: (hesitantly)
dialog: I can't do that.
speaker_heading: ROPER (V.O.)
dialog: Then get out of my face you worthless
dialog: piece of frogshit.
text: McCall looks up to his right.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Is all the name calling necessary.
text: Roper re-enters the training area.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Nah, I just throw that in because I
dialog: enjoy it.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: (exasperated)
dialog: So what do I say to this guy?
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: You could say something like,
dialog: (addressing the dummy)
dialog: "Tell me what the scumbag's name is.
dialog: Maybe we can work something out."
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: What? Bring somebody in so he can
dialog: cut his nuts off?
text: Roper turns to McCall.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: If you want to be a successful
dialog: negotiator, you've got to learn to
dialog: lie.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: I'm not good at lying.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Get good at it.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: It's against my nature.
text: Roper gives him an amused smile.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: You know the ten commandments?
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: What's the first commandment?
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Thou shall have no other God before
dialog: me.
dialog: That's not the answer Roper wanted.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Okay, forget that. What's the main
dialog: one.
text: McCall is tired of guessing.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: You tell me.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Thou shall not kill... You've killed,
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: To save lives.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: So why would you hesitate to lie to
dialog: save lives?
text: McCall can't argue with that one. Roper turns and heads back
text: to the side door.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Let's try it again.
scene_heading: INT. TRAINING ROOM - LATER
text: McCall comes through the door. Hands in the air. The setup
text: in the room has been changed a bit. The bad guy is behind
text: the counter. Several hostages in various positions on the
dialog: floor.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: My name's McCall. I'm unarmed.
speaker_heading: ROPER (V.O.)
dialog: Okay, stop.
text: Roper comes through the side door.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Close your eyes.
text: McCall is surprised by the command but closes them. Roper
text: turns him away from the hostage scene.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: What did you see?
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: (rapid-fire)
text: A dirtbag behind the counter holding
text: a sawed-off. A Berretta nine
text: millimeter in his belt. A female
text: hostage, red dress, on the floor in
text: front of the cereal display. Male
text: hostage, jeans and blue checked shirt,
text: three feet to her right. Another
text: male hostage, white pants, green
text: shirt, Nikes, laying in front of the
text: magazine rack. A female dirtbag with
text: a gun under her shirt, sitting against
text: the beer cooler, trying to pass
text: herself off as a hostage, and there's
dialog: a special on toilet-paper, four for
dialog: a buck twenty-nine.
text: McCall opens his eyes. Roper's impressed.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Very good. You've got good eyes.
dialog: That's important.
scene_heading: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
text: Roper and McCall are sitting in the dark watching a video
text: tape. It's grainy footage of a hostage situation in a sporting
text: goods store. A negotiator confronted with a gunman holding a
text: ten year old girl hostage. The negotiator holds his hands
text: out imploringly... Carefully moves toward the gunman. The
text: negotiator exchanges himself for the little girl. The gunman
text: grabs the negotiator around the neck, holds the gun to his
text: head. The little girl runs out of the picture to safety.
text: Roper remains dead silent during all this. McCall looks over
text: at him. The blue light flickers over Roper's motionless face.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Was that your partner?
text: Roper nods.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Why did he do it?
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Because he knew the little girl had
dialog: zero chance of survival and his
dialog: chances would be a little better...
dialog: We had a plan, but SWAT opened up
dialog: too early. He got caught in the
text: crossfire.
dialog: (a sad beat)
dialog: Let's move on... Notice this. Always
dialog: use the eyes to keep the connection.
dialog: It almost like hypnosis. That's the
dialog: most important thing. Create a
dialog: connection. You're always on their
dialog: side...
text: McCall watches him for a beat, then turns his attention back
text: on the screen.
scene_heading: EXT. GOLDEN GATE RACETRACK - DAY
text: Beautiful day. Roper and McCall leaning against the rail at
text: the walking ring. The horses are being paraded and saddled.
text: Roper scrutinizes them with an expert eye. McCall seems
text: totally disinterested.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: You know why I like the track?
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: You're a compulsive gambler?
text: Roper ignores that.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Because there are a multitude of
dialog: possibility's. Everything is there
dialog: to see if you know what to look for.
dialog: You have to read the conditions,
dialog: just like in a hostage situation.
text: Roper points across the ring to a particular horse.
speaker_heading: ROPER
text: See the four horse. Dropping in class.
text: No works. Front wraps. Looks like
text: he's broken down. But notice the
text: woman in the sun hat. She's the owner.
dialog: She wouldn't have come if her horse
dialog: was broken down. He's live. We use
dialog: him.
text: McCall listens indifferently.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: See the favorite? Tail up. Washy. He
dialog: doesn't want to run today. Cross him
dialog: off... Now the Six looks good. On
text: his toes. Coat shiny. This
dialog: trainer/jockey combo does well. We
dialog: can't leave him out.
dialog: (turns to McCall)
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: I have two words for you... Seek
dialog: help.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: I have three words for you... Ex-ac-
dialog: ta.
scene_heading: INT. BETTING WINDOWS - DAY
text: Roper is buying tickets. McCall is with him, watching the
text: other bettors, the odds board, all the monitors... Strange
text: place. Roper finishes and turns away from the window. Hands
text: McCall a ticket.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: I bought you a four-six exacta box.
dialog: You owe me twenty bucks.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: (puzzled)
dialog: I do.
scene_heading: EXT. SEATING AREA - DAY
text: Roper and McCall pass by a gambler.
speaker_heading: GAMBLER
dialog: Hey, Roper.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: How you doin', Marv?
text: They sit down in a box right up front.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: We need the 4 and 6 to finish to
dialog: first and second.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: (no enthusiasm)
dialog: Fine.
text: Roper uses his binoculars to watch the horses warm up on the
dialog: backstretch.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: I'm told that newspaper photographer
dialog: is your former girlfriend.
text: Roper looks over at him. What's this about?
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Ronnie... Yeah, so.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: So what do you want?... An autograph.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: I don't know why she'd pick him over
dialog: you.
text: Roper throws McCall a skeptical look.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: (straight-faced)
dialog: I'm just practicing my lying.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Still needs work.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: (downcast)
dialog: You're right. I'll never be as good
dialog: a liar as you.
speaker_heading: TRACK ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
dialog: And they're racing!
speaker_heading: ON THE TRACK
text: The horses spring from the gate. (The track announcer's call
dialog: plays through race)
speaker_heading: IN THE STANDS
text: Roper watches intently through the binoculars. McCall sits
text: impassively.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Okay, we're in good shape. We're in
dialog: good shape.
text: McCall looks across the track.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
text: The 6 horse is last.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: That's okay. That's his style.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: To run last?
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: To run late!
text: Roper follows the horses into the turn.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: The favorite's fading. I told you he
dialog: wasn't going to run today... The
dialog: four horse has got the lead!
text: McCall sits like a wax figure.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: (cynically)
text: The 6 horse is still last.
speaker_heading: ROPER
text: He'll be running at the quarter pole.
speaker_heading: ON THE TRACK
text: The horses head into the stretch. The FOUR is on the lead
text: and the SIX is starting to unleash a big run. Passing horses
text: with every stride.
speaker_heading: ROPER (V.O.)
text: There he goes.
speaker_heading: IN THE STANDS
text: McCall sits forward slightly.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: They need to run first and second?
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Yeah, first and second.
text: Roper gets to his feet.
speaker_heading: ON THE TRACK
text: The horses thunder down the stretch. The FOUR horse is in
text: front and the SIX is coming on from behind.
speaker_heading: IN THE STANDS
text: Roper is on his feet screaming.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Come on, Russell! Come on, Russell.
text: McCall jumps to this feet and joins him.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: COME ON RUSSELL!...
dialog: (to Roper)
dialog: Who the fuck's Russell?!
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: The jockey!
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: COME ON, RUSSELL!
text: Roper and McCall cheer together.
speaker_heading: ON THE TRACK
text: The FOUR horse crosses the finish line in front. The SIX
dialog: horse is flying... Needs to beat one horse to be second...
text: He's running out of room... With one last surge he hits the
dialog: wire and... It's too close to call.
speaker_heading: IN THE STANDS
text: McCall, really excited, turns to Roper.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: We won!
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: (disheartened)
dialog: We lost.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: (confidently)
dialog: We won.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: How much you wanna bet?
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: You want to bet on whether you won
dialog: your bet? This is getting sick.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON TOTE BOARD
text: As the photo finish light goes out and the numbers come on...
dialog: 4-6-8. They won.
speaker_heading: IN THE STANDS
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Yes!
dialog: High fives.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: That's eight hundred bucks.
scene_heading: INT. BET/CASH WINDOW - DAY
text: Roper and McCall collect their money. Four hundred a piece,
text: not bad. McCall pockets his money.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: How long you been coming here?
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: About six years. My partner took me.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Is it always like this?
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Occasionally you lose.
text: Suddenly Roper's BEEPER goes off. He checks it, takes out a
text: cellular phone and dials.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: (into the phone)
dialog: Roper here.
dialog: (he listens)
dialog: I'm on my way.
text: He hangs up and turns to McCall.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: We gotta go.
scene_heading: EXT. JEWELRY STORE - UNION SQUARE - DAY
text: Marble facade. Tastefully reinforced windows and door.
text: Choppers circle overhead. Both ends of the street are sealed
text: off. Barricades are up. Spectators and news crews crowd behind
text: those. Numerous police circulate. This is a major operation
text: in full swing.
scene_heading: INT. TRAVEL AGENCY - COMMAND CENTER - DAY
text: It's across the street from the jewelry store. Second story.
text: The walls are plastered with travel posters. A poster of
text: Tahiti is the most prominent. Members of police and SWAT are
text: standing over a blueprint of the jewelry store spread out on
text: a table. Right behind them is a TV monitoring the front of
text: the store. Solis is at another desk, on the phone. He's
text: talking to the suspect.
speaker_heading: SOLIS
dialog: We're working on that, Joe. These
dialog: things aren't quite that simple.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY
text: Roper and McCall push through the barricades and come walking
text: down the cordoned-off street. McCall takes a look at the
text: jewelry store. Well fortified, foreboding.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: This does not look good.
text: Roper looks over there, gives no reaction. They reach Solis'
text: convertible Cadillac. It's parked out front of the travel
dialog: agency building.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: See this. Solis has me driving the
dialog: shit-mobile, and he picked this up
dialog: straight out of impound for fourteen
dialog: grand. Probably worth thirty.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Police corruption. It's everywhere.
scene_heading: INT. COMMAND POST - DAY
text: Roper and McCall enter. McCall joins the men who are studying
text: the blueprint. Roper stands by Solis and listens, takes note
text: of the poster of Tahiti. Looks inviting.
speaker_heading: SOLIS
dialog: This will take time to setup. I'll
dialog: have to get authorizations.
dialog: (he listens)
dialog: Okay, you relax, and I'll --
text: Solis pulls the phone away from his ear. Joe has obviously
dialog: hung up.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: What do we got?
speaker_heading: SOLIS
text: 32 minutes ago the silent alarm went
text: off, then the fire alarm. A unit was
text: a block away, and the suspect got
text: trapped inside.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Any verification on numbers.
speaker_heading: SOLIS
dialog: We've only seen and talked to one
text: suspect. He calls himself "Joe".
text: There's two jewelers, two salespeople,
text: the manager, a security guard, and
dialog: an elderly woman. This particular
dialog: store is where they do a lot of
dialog: jewelry making and repair. They have
dialog: anywhere from 8 to 10 million in raw
dialog: stones on any given day, so they
dialog: sure as shit didn't just wander in.
dialog: They knew what they were coming for.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: What have you promised them?
speaker_heading: SOLIS
dialog: Just that I'd talk to my superiors.
text: McCall returns from checking out the blueprints.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Any good points of entry?
text: McCall shakes his head.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
text: The place is designed to be a vault.
text: Roper picks up the cellular phone. It dials automatically.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: (into the phone)
dialog: My name's Roper. How are you people
dialog: doing in there?
dialog: (he listens)
dialog: Solis is off the job now, Joe. I'm
dialog: the guy authorized to give you
dialog: whatever you want.
dialog: (listens)
dialog: That's right, but first I need to
dialog: come down there to talk to you.
scene_heading: INT. JEWELRY STORE - DAY
text: We don't see anything but the suspect on the other end of
text: the phone. He's wearing a ski mask and gloves. Totally
text: unrecognizable to the audience. We will find out soon that
text: he is, in fact, Korda. He appears very cool and collected.
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: You don't have to come here.
scene_heading: INT. COMMAND CENTER - DAY
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Yes, I do. That way there's no
dialog: misunderstandings. I need to make
dialog: sure no one's hurt, then we can take
dialog: care of business.
text: A long pause... Then a bit sinister.
speaker_heading: KORDA (V.O.)
dialog: Alright, Roper. You want to come...
dialog: come.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Good. I won't be armed. We gotta
dialog: operate on trust here. We're going
dialog: to wrap this up and have you guys
dialog: out of here as soon as possible.
text: Roper clicks off the phone. He already doesn't like the sound
dialog: of this guy.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET OUTSIDE JEWELRY STORE - DAY
text: Roper, bulletproof vest, hands in the air, walks across the
text: eerily deserted street straight toward the jewelry store.
text: It's quiet now. The choppers have been pulled back.
text: Roper reaches the sidewalk right in front of the store. Korda
text: cracks the door open.
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: (warningly)
dialog: Stay there.
text: Roper stops in his tracks.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: I'm going to put my hands down, okay.
text: Roper slowly lowers his hands.
scene_heading: INT. COMMAND CENTER
text: Everybody watching through the window.
scene_heading: EXT. JEWELRY STORE - DAY
text: Korda takes a half step out the doorway. The gloved hand
text: that is visible is not holding a weapon. The other half of
text: his body is hidden inside the doorway. He wears jeans, a
text: black shirt, and black Nike tennis shoes. He stares fiercely
text: from behind the ski mask. There's no sign of fear in him.
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: Are you in charge, Roper?
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Yep.
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: I want a car. Like a four wheel drive.
dialog: I want it in perfect condition. I
dialog: want a uniformed cop to drive it up
dialog: right here. I want him to leave the
text: engine running and walk to the end
dialog: of the street. Then we'll come out.
dialog: I don't want any remote control
dialog: devices in it. I know all the tricks.
dialog: If it's not in perfect condition,
dialog: and I mean if its even low on wiper
dialog: fluid, I'm going to kill somebody
dialog: and we're gonna start again.
text: Korda lets that sink in.
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: I want a plane waiting at the airport.
dialog: I'll tell them where I want to go
dialog: when I get there.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Is that all?
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: For now that's all.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you
dialog: to do something for me. Let me take
dialog: a look around inside. Make sure
dialog: everybody's okay.
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: No. You just do shit for me right
dialog: now.
text: Korda's eyes glare from behind the ski mask. He's an ominous
dialog: figure.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Joe, I'm doing a lot for you. I think
dialog: you could give me something to cement
dialog: the deal... One hostage.
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: I'll give you something.
text: Korda pulls a wadded-up handkerchief out of his pocket and
text: tosses it to Roper. Roper unwraps the handkerchief.
speaker_heading: DETAIL SHOT
dialog: It's a human ear.
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: In fifteen minutes it'll be a bigger
dialog: piece. I assume there are no
dialog: "misunderstanding".
text: Roper is as serious as we've ever seen him.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: I understand you completely.
text: Korda disappears back behind the door.
scene_heading: EXT. COMMAND CENTER - DAY
text: Roper trudges back in. Things are more active now. Logistical
text: officers are making flow charts. Photos of the hostages are
text: being posted on a bulletin board. Roper approaches Solis,
text: McCall and the SWAT CAPTAIN who are anxiously waiting for
dialog: his report.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: (flatly)
dialog: We're going to have to take this guy
dialog: out.
text: That draws a long silence. That's something Roper rarely
dialog: says.
speaker_heading: SOLIS
dialog: Can't we wear him down?
text: Roper hands Solis the handkerchief with the ear in it. Solis
text: eyes it with dismay.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: I believe there's at least one
text: fatality in there already. The fire
text: alarm was probably set off by gunfire.
dialog: I believe he's working alone, both
dialog: from his conversation and the fact
dialog: that he wouldn't come out beyond the
text: doorway. He was holding a gun on the
text: hostages while he was talking to me.
text: His demeanor is calm and controlled,
dialog: that's what really scares me. The
dialog: other bad news is that he also
dialog: indicated a familiarity with our
dialog: techniques.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: So, do you want to go in or wait for
dialog: him to come out?
text: McCall calmly offers his opinion.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Let him come out. Too many unknowns
dialog: in there.
text: Solis nods. That'll be the plan.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: When we drive up the car, make sure
text: it's at an angle about three feet
text: from the curb.
dialog: (to SWAT Captain)
dialog: Put our best man "highground", Twenty
dialog: degree down angle.
text: The SWAT Captain motions and turns to one of his UNDERLINGS.
speaker_heading: SWAT CAPTAIN
dialog: Have Anderson prep it and notify us
text: when he's on line.
text: The underling hurries off to take care of it. Solis looks at
text: Roper dejectedly.
speaker_heading: SOLIS
dialog: I feel this thing going sideways on
dialog: us.
text: Roper tries to buck him up.
speaker_heading: ROPER
text: There is some good news. He's wearing
text: a ski mask, so he's protecting his
dialog: identity and hasn't determined to
dialog: kill all the hostages...
dialog: (big pause)
dialog: Yet.
scene_heading: INT. JEWELRY STORE - DAY
text: The jewel thief pulls off his ski mask to reveal he is Korda.
text: His face is sweaty. Hair matted. ANGLE WIDENS to show five
text: very scared hostages: A JEWELER, middle-aged, balding. The
text: male MANAGER, good-looking, thirties, three piece suit. TWO
text: SALESGIRLS, nicely dressed, late twenties. A FEMALE CUSTOMER,
text: gray-haired Hillsborough matron. They are all seated against
text: the wall. There are two fatalities lying on the floor. The
text: guard and one of the jewelers.
text: Korda points his gun at the manager and the other jeweler
text: and motions to the dead bodies.
speaker_heading: KORDA
text: Drag them behind the counter.
text: The two men reluctantly get to their feet and commence the
text: grim task. The two salesgirls watch Korda fearfully. The
text: older female customer seems to be in a lesser state of
text: reality. Her eyes are a bit far away.
text: Korda moves over to the remaining display cases that haven't
text: been looted. With the barrel of his gun, He SMASHES the glass,
text: reaches in and picks out the jewelry. He dumps it in an open
text: satchel already half-filled with packets of raw gemstones
text: and gold chains. Suddenly, the older woman customer gets to
text: her feet. She seems fairly out-of-it. Maybe in shock. She
text: starts walking toward the front door frowning with
dialog: dissatisfaction.
speaker_heading: WOMAN CUSTOMER
dialog: I'm not staying here another minute.
speaker_heading: SALESGIRL #1
dialog: (panicky)
dialog: No, Mrs. Dotson.
text: Korda rushes around the display case.
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: Come here, hag.
text: He grabs a handful of the woman's coiffed gray hair and drags
text: her away from the door. She shrieks. The manager takes a
text: step toward Korda.
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: Leave her alone!
text: Korda pistol whips her across the forehead and drops her
text: unconscious to the floor then turns the gun on the manager.
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: You're a brave one, aren't you?
text: The manager glares at him. He's about Korda's size. He thinks
text: about making a run at him.
speaker_heading: SALESGIRL #2
dialog: (pleading)
dialog: Sit down, Doug.
text: A long beat... The manager sits back down on the floor with
text: the other hostages. Salesgirl 1 is giving aid to the old
text: woman. Korda looks down at her.
speaker_heading: KORDA
text: If she's not conscious when it's
dialog: time to leave, I'll have to kill
dialog: her.
text: Korda goes back to the display cases to collect the rest of
dialog: the gems.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY
text: Cops clear spectators out of the way as a green FORD EXPLORER
text: RUMBLES through the barricade and heads down the deserted
dialog: street.
scene_heading: INT. COMMAND CENTER - DAY
text: Roper and McCall at the window, attention fixed on the store.
text: The Explorer crawls to a stop in front of the jewelry store.

text: barricade.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Okay. Time to give this fucker a

scene_heading: INT. COMMAND CENTER - SAME
text: The phone is still ringing.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: This fucker's not answering.
text: Just then, the front door of the jewelry store swings open.
text: A spray of white vapor shoots out the doorway. Korda is
text: discharging a fire extinguisher.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: There's your answer. He's smart.
speaker_heading: ROPER
text: He's cutting down the visibility.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: And doing a very good job of it.
text: A thick cloud of white hangs over the sidewalk obscuring the
text: front of the jewelry store. Roper puts down the phone.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Come on. Give us one clean shot.
speaker_heading: SWAT CAPTAIN
dialog: (into his radio)
dialog: All positions, you have the green
text: light.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: They're out.
text: Roper grabs a pair of binoculars.
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: Through the haze, we catch glimpses of the hostages circled

dialog: the Explorer.
text: McCall watches intently.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP - SAME
text: A sniper watches through his scope. Finger poised on the
dialog: trigger.
text: ANGLE THROUGH THE SCOPE
text: Low visibility through the haze. The figure in the ski mask
text: wavers in and out of the crosshairs, shielded momentarily by
text: the jeweler, then he flashes back into the crosshairs. The
text: sniper tries to lock him in.
scene_heading: INT. COMMAND CENTER - ROPER'S POV - BINOCULARS - SAME
text: The figure in the ski mask leans slightly and Roper catches
text: a glimpse of the hostage right behind him. Roper recognizes
text: him instantly.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: It's Korda.
text: McCall sees him now, too.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: They switched clothes.
text: Roper drops the binoculars and grabs his police radio.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: (urgently)
dialog: Hold your fire! Hold your fire!
text: Too late. A SHOT rings out. The figure in the ski mask goes
text: down, hit by the bullet.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Shit! Where'd that shot come from?
dialog: Hold your fire!
text: More SHOTS ring out.
text: DOWN ON THE STREET
text: The white vapor cloud swirls. The hostages, spattered with
text: blood, scream and scatter. The figure in the ski mask lies
text: dead on the sidewalk. Korda, dressed in the manager's three
text: piece suit, holding the satchel of jewels in one hand and
text: his gun in the other FIRES back at the snipers. He grabs
text: salesgirl 1 and drags her into the Explorer.
scene_heading: INT. COMMAND CENTER
text: Roper sees Korda move toward the car with one of the hostages.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: He's got the girl.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Damnit!

speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: (grabbing the keys;

dialog: Are these yours?
speaker_heading: SOLIS
dialog: Yeah, they are but...
speaker_heading: ROPER

dialog: Don't take my...
text: And Roper and McCall are gone.
speaker_heading: SOLIS
dialog: ...car.
text: DOWN ON THE STREET
text: Police come rushing onto the street. Guns drawn. The Explorer

speaker_heading: OMITTED

scene_heading: EXT. POLICE BARRICADES - DAY
text: The Explorer comes barreling toward it. Spectators scatter.

speaker_heading: OMITTED
dialog: Sequence omitted from original script.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY
text: The Explorer careens up an alley and bursts into the congested

text: off down the street.
scene_heading: INT. VAN - DAY
text: The salesgirl is terrified. Korda checks the rear view mirror.
text: No one on his tail... At first. Then the Cadillac comes
text: speeding up behind...
scene_heading: INT. CADILLAC - DAY
text: Roper and McCall have the Van in sight, about a block ahead.
text: Roper picks up the radio.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
text: Suspect heading west on Sutter now

speaker_heading: VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: R-32-David. We are proceeding south

scene_heading: INT. VAN - DAY
text: Korda has one eye on the road and the other on the rear view

speaker_heading: UP AHEAD
text: a squad car SCREECHES into the intersection and smokes to a
text: stop. Korda jerks the wheel, pulls a SCREAMING right turn
text: and heads up the hill.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY
text: The Cadillac is only about a hundred feet behind the van...
text: Brakes SQUEALING, it swerves around the corner in pursuit.
speaker_heading: THE VAN
text: hits the top of the hill and goes airborne... SLAMS back
text: down to the pavement.
scene_heading: INT. VAN - DAY
text: Korda floors it, and we get a frightening view out the

text: beyond petrified.
speaker_heading: THE CADILLAC
text: reaches the top of the hill. Going fast.
scene_heading: INT. CADILLAC
text: As it rocks forward violently. Front bumper slamming against

speaker_heading: VAN
text: Korda sees traffic ahead... Intersection jammed. He pulls a

speaker_heading: THE VAN
text: cuts straight across the corner... up on the sidewalk...

text: the air... The van speeds off down a one-way street...
speaker_heading: THE CADILLAC
text: arrives at the intersection a few seconds later...
text: Intersection still jammed... People now standing on the corner
text: gawking at the damage. The Caddy SCREECHES to a stop. McCall
text: HONKS... The people scatter... The Cadillac drives through
dialog: the corner.
speaker_heading: THE VAN
text: Wrong way down a one-way street. Cars coming right at us in

speaker_heading: THE CADILIAC
text: Down the same one way street... Comes up on the head-on

scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY
text: The Cadillac roars around the corner and heads up the hill.
scene_heading: INT. VAN
text: Korda, checking the rear view mirror. The Caddy is a short

text: Korda stiffens... Pulls on the wheel
speaker_heading: THE STREET
text: The van swerves... But not quick enough... GRINDING metal...
text: SHATTERING glass... The van rolls over another car...
text: BRIEF CUT - LOOKING OUT THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD
text: Korda and the salesgirl tossed about as the van does a
dialog: dizzying roll...
speaker_heading: THE VAN
text: ...and CRASHES back down to the street upside down. After a

text: jewels. The salesgirl does not emerge. He spots a cable car
text: reaching the top of the hill and starting its long descend.
text: He heads toward it...
scene_heading: INT. CABLE CAR
text: As Korda comes toward them from the wreckage, some of the
text: passengers view him uneasily.
speaker_heading: THE CADILLAC
text: hits the top of the hill just in time for Rope and McCall to
text: see Korda leap onto the moving cable car.
speaker_heading: CABLE CAR
text: other passengers give Korda room. They can sense that he is
text: not here merely for the ride. Korda looks out the back...
text: Roper and McCall haven't lost track of him. The Cadillac is
text: making up ground on the cable car.
text: Korda moves to the back exit, pulls his gun and FIRES off a
text: couple of shots at the Caddy.
scene_heading: INT. CADILLAC
text: A bullet fractures the windshield. McCall swerves.
text: BACK ON THE CABLE CAR
text: That makes up the minds of many of the passenger. They leap
text: off the cable car.
text: Korda takes aim on the Caddy again and FIRES!
text: The brakeman charges down the aisle while Korda has his
text: attention focused out the back and tries to shove him off
dialog: the cable car...
text: Almost works... but Korda is able to hang on by one hand...
text: He swings around toward the Brakeman who turns involuntarily
text: as he sees the barrel of the gun pointed at him... BANG!
text: Korda shoots him in the back.
text: The brakeman staggers down the aisle and slumps across the

scene_heading: EXT. UNDER CABLE CAR
text: The brakes are stressed.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET
text: Now driverless, the cable car picks up speed... Broadsides a

speaker_heading: THE CABLE CAR

speaker_heading: A SIDE ANGLE

speaker_heading: ROPER

scene_heading: EXT. INTERSECTION

speaker_heading: THE CADILLAC
text: Weaves through the wreckage... Makes up ground on the cable

speaker_heading: THE CABLE CAR

scene_heading: INT. CAR OF MAN TRAPPED IN INTERSECTION

speaker_heading: CABLE CAR

speaker_heading: INTERSECTION
text: Pedestrains bolt out of the way as the cable car streaks

speaker_heading: THE CABLE CAR

dialog: points ahead...
speaker_heading: ROPER'S POV
text: The cable car.
speaker_heading: ROPER
text: Leaps to the brake lever. Pulls on it.
scene_heading: ANGLE UNDER THE CABLE CAR
text: The clamp tries to slow the descent. It whine and smokes...
text: Then disintegrates before our eyes.
speaker_heading: THE CABLE CAR
text: Roper feels the lever go slack in his hands. The cable car
text: is speeding toward the end of the line... No way to stop
text: it... Roper turns and takes a running leap into the Caddy...
scene_heading: INT. CADDY
text: He lands in the passenger seat. Roper pounds his foot down
text: on the accelerator. The Caddy lunges ahead of the cable car...
text: McCall can't figure out what he's doing. Roper yanks the
text: steering wheel hard right...
scene_heading: EXT. STREET
text: The Caddy collides with the front of the cable car. Tires
text: SCREAM. The steel wheels CLATTER. A cloud of burning rubber
text: forms. The cable car grinds forward pushing the Cadillac...
text: But it's working. The cable car is slowing.
scene_heading: BOTTOM OF STREET
text: The crowd now sees the Caddy and cable car bearing down on
text: them. General hysteria as they flee.
speaker_heading: THE CABLE CAR
text: Korda regains consciousness. Sees what's going on. He grabs
text: the satchel and bails out of the cable car...
speaker_heading: STREET
text: ...Onto the hood of a passing taxi. The taxi slams on its
text: brakes. Korda rolls off the hood, picks himself up and runs
text: into an underground garage.
speaker_heading: THE CABLE CAR
text: Grinding to a halt just short of the end of the line. Roper
text: grabs McCall's gun off the seat and leaps out of the Caddy
text: to pursue Korda. People approach to ogle the two vehicles in
dialog: astonishment.
scene_heading: INT. GARAGE - DAY
text: Roper moves up an interior stairway, gun in "ready" position.
text: He knows Korda is somewhere in the parking structure. He
text: glides up the stairway to the third level. Checks back over
text: the rail... No one around... Then a sound from inside the
text: garage... Footsteps maybe.
text: Roper carefully opens the door... Swings in with his gun...
scene_heading: INT. THIRD LEVEL - GARAGE
text: Lots of cars, but no one in sight. Roper moves quickly to
text: the protection of a row of cars... He crouches down. Scans
text: beneath the cars... No sign of Korda.
text: Roper searches between two rows... Comes up beside a van...
text: Thinks he hears something stirring inside. Whirls a gun toward
dialog: the window.
text: A dog lunges at the CAMERA... Snarling... baring teeth...
text: Roper moves on.
speaker_heading: NEW ANGLE
text: As a BMW crawls through the parking structure. Roper steps
text: into the FOREGROUND, right into its path, gun visible. The
text: BMW rolls to a stop. Roper approaches with caution.
text: Roper comes up beside the car and sees a very frightened 30
text: year old blonde. Roper takes a check out of the backseat.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Sorry, go.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE CAR
text: The woman rolls up the window and hits the gas. She drives
dialog: off.
scene_heading: INT. GARAGE
text: Roper stands in the middle of the garage and takes a final
text: scan... He has the discouraging feeling that Korda might
dialog: have escaped.
text: He heads toward the exit... Suddenly a SCREECH of tires...
text: Roper whirls to see a sedan bearing down on him. He drives
text: and FIRES! Bullets shatter the windshield.
text: The car continues toward Roper. He has to roll out of the
text: path of the car. The car swerves past Roper. Tries to make
text: it down the ramp. Roper fires again, taking out the rear
text: window and a rear tire. The car slides along the guard rail
text: and continues down to the next level. Roper runs after it.
scene_heading: GARAGE - 2ND LEVEL
text: As the car reaches the next level, Korda loses control and
text: piles into a parked car.
text: Korda crawls out of the car clutching his precious satchel
text: of jewels. Dazed, he staggers away from the wreck.
text: Roper moves to him with a face grim as death. He strips the
text: satchel from Korda's hand and slams him against the open car
text: door. Korda goes to his knees. Roper holds the barrel of his
text: gun right up between Korda's eyes.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Give me one reason why I shouldn't
dialog: kill you right here.
text: Korda stares back at Roper defiantly. He knows a cop won't
dialog: kill him in cold blood...
text: What he doesn't know is that Roper doesn't give a shit about
dialog: those rules at this moment.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: You know Sam Baffert was a friend of
dialog: mine. He had a wife... and he had a
dialog: daughter.
text: Korda stares past the barrel of the gun.
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: I don't give a shit about you or
dialog: your fucking friends.
text: And that makes Roper even angrier... But he keeps it all
text: inside. His expression is as cold as a San Francisco night.
text: He yanks back hard on Korda's hair. Pushes the gun tighter
text: against Korda's forehead. He's on the verge of executing
dialog: this guy.
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: You can't kill me like this.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: What if you and me got into a
dialog: struggle... and my gun went off?
text: In a flash, Roper points the gun upward and fires off a SHOT!
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Could I kill you then?
dialog: (beat, beat)
dialog: Could I kill you then?
text: Roper jams the gun back under Korda's chin. A pull of the
text: trigger would send a bullet straight up through Korda's skull.
text: And now Korda is fully convinced. He squeezes his eyes closed.
text: Face straining so hard, he looks like he's going to burst
text: out of his skin.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - MCCALL
text: moving across garage into position.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Roper! Put it down!... Put it down
dialog: man, we got him.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Come on... Put it down.
text: Long, long beat. Roper eases up and Korda smiles. Just when
text: we feel the scene is over, Roper turns back quickly and kicks
text: Korda in the stomach, then grabs Korda by the hair, pulls
text: his head back and shoves the gun in his face.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: We do this shit by the book, but you
dialog: ain't gonna be smiling.

speaker_heading: RONNIE

speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: I wanted to get this out of the way.
speaker_heading: RONNIE

speaker_heading: ROPER

speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: It's already started.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: I was going to catch the last half

text: Ronnie watches him for a moment. He stops typing, looks at

dialog: it was something she was thinking.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: Good-night.
text: She turns abruptly to leave. Roper finds himself rising from

speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: You having dinner with Mr. Baseball?

speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: Greg is on a road trip. I was just

speaker_heading: ROPER

speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: Mmm, needs a little something.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: What are you talking about? This is

dialog: (beat; he tastes)
dialog: Well, maybe just a pinch more sugar.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: Yeah that's it.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Why don't you just stick your finger
dialog: in and stir it up.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Scottie...
text: There is a long pause as he looks at her.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: What would you say if I quit gambling?
text: Ronnie stirs the macaroni.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: I'd say you'd be miserable... It's
dialog: not the gambling. It's what the
dialog: gambling got in the way of. The track
dialog: is where you'd take your troubles
dialog: instead of sharing them with me...
text: Ronnie puts the lid on the macaroni. There is a beat before
text: she continues.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: Scottie, remember the day you lost
dialog: that hostage in union square. You
dialog: came over that night and we made
dialog: mad, crazy love. But I didn't even
dialog: know what happened... 'til I heard
text: it on the news the next morning.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: It's because I wanted to keep you

speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: It's not that world. It's your world.
dialog: It's part of who you are.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Veronica, it's not easy for me... I

speaker_heading: KORDA

speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: Man, what's this about? Ya know, you

speaker_heading: KORDA

dialog: Fuck you! You know what he did to

speaker_heading: KORDA

speaker_heading: RONNIE

scene_heading: EXT. RONNIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Ronnie lifts the lid on the sauce. Stirs. It spatters on her

scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Ronnie unbuttons her blouse as she moves to the...
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: She takes off the blouse, goes to the closet door... throws

text: a step into the closet and finds what she's looking for -- A
text: laundry basket -- tucked away in the corner. She puts the
text: soiled blouse in the hamper and takes a fresh one off a
text: hanger. She buttons the clean blouse as she walks to...
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Dark. She turns on the light. She goes to the mirrored
dialog: medicine cabinet.
scene_heading: IN THE REFLECTION
text: Behind her the shower curtain is drawn, fluttering ever so
text: slightly. She opens the medicine cabinet. Takes out some
text: perfume. Dabs some on her neck. She puts back the bottle and
text: closes the cabinet. We fully expect someone to be standing
text: right behind her in the reflection... There's no one there.
text: She turns off the light as she walks out of the bathroom.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Ronnie walks back to the kitchen... Notices something on the

text: closer... And now we get to the POV that tells us someone is
text: in the house... Watching her through a cracked doorway.
speaker_heading: BRIEF CUT
text: A hand opening a buck knife. Water drips from the fingers.
text: BACK IN THE HALL
text: Ronnie bends down. It's a wet spot. Like half a shoeprint.
text: She reaches down to touch it...
text: BUZZZZZ!!!! The oven timer. She hurries back to the kitchen.
scene_heading: INT. RONNIE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: She turns off the timer and pulls some chicken out of the
text: oven. She puts it down on the counter and cross to the
text: refrigerator. She opens the door and looks inside. The
text: refrigerator door obscures half the FRAME... She digs around
dialog: for something... We're sure that when she closes the door,
text: he's going to be behind it... She takes out a head of lettuce
text: and... Closes the door... Still no one there.
text: She turns... Clarence is standing there. Dripping wet. Ronnie
text: shrieks... The knife flashes forward... She grabs the lid
text: from the sauce pan and CLANG... Fends off the blade. She
text: bolts for the hallway. Clarence grabs her by the blouse...
text: RIP! She pulls away.
text: IN THE HALLWAY
text: She races down the hall. Clarence lunges into FRAME. She
text: goes down... He goes down... the knife goes skidding down
text: the hallway... Ronnie scrambles to get it... Clarence has
text: her by the ankle... She claws for the knife... Just out of
dialog: reach.
scene_heading: EXT. RONNIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Roper's pickup pulls up in front. He gets out. Paco jumps

text: toward the house. Suddenly Roper realizes he forgot the wine.
text: He goes back to the truck. Paco pads after him.
text: Roper opens the driver's side door, reaches in and grabs the
text: wine. He closes the door, starts away, but pauses to check
text: himself in the window.
text: Suddenly, a floodlight comes crashing through Ronnie's front
text: bay windows. It SPARKS and FLASHES. Still plugged in, it
text: bungees to a stop hallway down the front of the house.
text: FLICKERING and FLASHING.
text: Roper rushes toward the house... Crashes through the front
text: door... Up the stairway... Paco bounds after him... Roper
text: hits her front door running... Wham! He bounces off. He
text: shoulders it again... The door doesn't give... He pulls out

speaker_heading: ROPER

speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: (to Paco)
dialog: Stay.
text: The dog obediently stays with Ronnie. Roper dashes out the
dialog: back.
scene_heading: EXT. BACK OF RONNIE'S - NIGHT
text: Raining more heavily now. Roper bursts out onto the back
text: porch. Sees Clarence leaping off the last rung of the fire
text: escape to the alley. Roper flies down the fire escape...
text: Vaults the last flight and races after Clarence.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: Clarence sprints down the block... Through the intersection...
text: HONK! SCREECH! A car barely misses him. It does a one-eighty
text: on the rain-slick pavement. Clarence disappears into the
text: shadows. Roper arrives a beat later... Streaks through the
text: intersection... Into the shadows.
scene_heading: EXT. ANOTHER STREET - NIGHT
text: This one is steep. Clarence huffs and puffs as he labors. He
text: shoots into a doorway. Tries the door. Locked. He looks back.
text: Roper is coming. Relentless. He rushes across the steep
text: street. Almost slips on the reflective asphalt. Roper spots
text: him crossing and picks up the pace. He can see that Clarence
text: is faltering.
text: NEAR THE TOP OF THE HILL
text: Clarence staggers into an alleyway...
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT
text: Narrow, dark and dripping with rain. Roper arrives at the
text: mouth of the alley. Gun ready, he moves cautiously, eyes
text: adjusting to the darkness. The PATTER of rain off the
text: rooftops. His FOOTSTEPS. No other sound.
text: He reaches the end of the alley... A brick wall. No way out.
text: Or so it would seem. However, Clarence is nowhere in sight.
text: Roper turns back. Brick walls tower on both sides, rising
text: into darkness. Roper checks a steel door. Locked. He checks
text: another one on the opposite side of the alley. Also locked.
text: Where did Clarence go? He moves back toward the misting light
dialog: of the street... Slowly...
text: The FAINT RATTLE of a fire escape... And Clarence leaps down
text: out of the shadow. Slashing with the knife. He catches Roper
text: across the arm.
text: Rips through his clothes right down to the skin. Roper's gun
text: CLATTERS under a parked car and into the street. Clarence
text: has first jump. He scrambles into the street, around the car
text: and grabs the gun...
text: Roper dives over the hood of the car and knocks Clarence
text: down before he can aim. They roll into the middle of the
text: street. Both have a death grip on the weapon. Clarence fights
text: like a trapped animal. Thrashing desperately. Roper pins him
text: on his back, but can't pry the gun out of his fingers.
speaker_heading: WIDER SHOT
text: Headlights radiate over the crest of the hill. Coming quickly.
text: Roper sees this. He rolls out of the way, abandoning the
text: battle for the gun. Clarence struggles to his knees. Turns
text: the weapon on Roper... A speeding cab lunges over the top of
text: the hill. Clarence turns, trapped in the searing headlights.
text: Tires squeal. Brakes lock. Clarence is transfixed... WHAM!
text: He's launched through the air like a ragdoll... His body
text: lands limply 30 feet down the street. The CABBY gets out of
dialog: his vehicle.
speaker_heading: CABBY
dialog: Jesus Christ. What was he doing?!
text: Roper walks down the hill to the body. The cabby follows.
speaker_heading: CABBY
dialog: There was no way I could miss him.
text: Roper ignores the cabby. He looks down at Clarence's body,
text: contemplating something.
speaker_heading: CABBY
dialog: This isn't my fault.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Shut the fuck up!
text: The cabby immediately clams up.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Get on your radio and get the police
dialog: here.

speaker_heading: KORDA'S POV
text: Roper is sitting stoically behind the plexiglass wall.
speaker_heading: KORDA

dialog: I know, I'm going to have you killed.
text: Korda feigns total innocence.
speaker_heading: KORDA

speaker_heading: ROPER

text: Korda's face tightens. He drops the innocent act. His

speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: I used to have an apartment, a car,

text: Roper sits there, suddenly feeling powerless.
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: You came here to threaten me? That's
dialog: a laugh. Maybe you should BEG me...

speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: You motherfucker, I swear I'll kill

text: The guard rushes over and restrains Roper. Wrestles him away

dialog: Something about a microchip in his
dialog: brain.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Who is he?
text: A NURSE answers him.
speaker_heading: NURSE HERRIN
dialog: David Adler. He likes to be called
dialog: Dave. The other guy is Walter
dialog: Sinclair.
text: We hear the urgent cry of the vet in the wheelchair.
speaker_heading: VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: Somebody help me out here. Somebody
dialog: stop him.
text: The nurse turns to McCall.
speaker_heading: NURSE HERRIN
dialog: What are you waiting for?
speaker_heading: MCCALL
text: Another negotiator is on his way.
speaker_heading: NURSE HERRIN
dialog: We can't wait for another negotiator.
dialog: You have to do something.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: What about the doctors?
speaker_heading: NURSE HERRIN
dialog: He hates all the doctors. He says
dialog: they're in on the conspiracy.
speaker_heading: VET #1 (O.S.)
dialog: Where is everybody? He's going to
dialog: kill me!
text: McCall takes a deep breath and steps out onto the roof.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOF - DAY
text: McCall moves slowly across the tar paper roof. Clouds overhead
text: threaten rain. Vet 1 turns to him suddenly, wobbling the
text: wheelchair. Vet 2 shrieks and nearly goes over. McCall's
text: heart jumps into his mouth.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Get the fuck out of here!
text: McCall is tense and stiff. He stammers.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: I... I'm Kevin. I 'm here to help
dialog: you, D... Dave.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: You can't help me, man.
text: So much for McCall's opener. Now what?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: He's high on something, man. Give
dialog: him some thorazine or something.
text: Dave ignores Walter.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: No one can help me. They're
dialog: controlling my mind.
text: McCall moves a couple steps closer.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Who's controlling your mind?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Whoa!... The government. They control
dialog: everybody's mind. You're too fucking
dialog: stupid to know that?
text: McCall fumbles for the right response.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: This has nothing to do with Walter.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: They want Walter dead!
scene_heading: EXT. STREET BELOW - DAY
text: Cops keep spectators back from the building. Fire trucks and
text: rescue vehicles are on the scene. Everybody looking straight
text: up watching the wheelchair with its occupant dangling over
text: the side of the building.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOF - DAY
text: Walter sits stock still in the wheelchair drenched with sweat,
text: eyes closed, praying.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Dave, look at me.
text: Dave obliges. He looks at McCall with eyes that have lost
text: the battle for sanity. McCall is momentarily frozen by those
text: eyes. Beads of sweat have formed on his forehead.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Tell me what's wrong.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Particles, man. I feel them all the
text: time. I feel them in my arms and
dialog: legs man, that's how they punish me.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: How can I help you with the particles?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: It's not just the particles man,
dialog: it's the whole fucking machine, this
dialog: is how they get assassins to operate.
dialog: It's been this way since the cuban
dialog: missile crisis.
text: Dave starts to look over into the street, he tips Walter
text: forward, Walter shrieks in mortal fear. White knuckles the
text: armrests of his wheelchair and then:
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: (blurting out)
dialog: They have less power over you if you
dialog: look into my eyes.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Huh?
text: McCall even surprises himself with that one. It was a sheer
text: act of desperation. He holds his breath and waits to see
text: what the effect is. Dave turns back around.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Huh?
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT
text: Roper's truck comes speeding down the street, lurches to a
text: halt. He leaps out and speaks to a FIREMAN.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Whata ya got?
speaker_heading: FIREMAN
text: Some nuts dangling a guy over the
text: edge in a wheelchair.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Can you get a net out here?
speaker_heading: FIREMAN
dialog: Negative. It's 14 floors up. No nets
dialog: gonna hold a fall from that high up.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOF - DAY
text: McCall nods slowly. Sweat pouring off him.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: We've been onto them for a long time.
text: A glimmer from Dave. Maybe McCall is a kindred spirit.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Let me show you something.
text: Now he's got Dave's interest. McCall slowly takes out his
text: beeper.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: See this. I'm jamming them, Dave.
dialog: I'm jamming their frequency so they
dialog: can't control your mind anymore.
dialog: Don't you feel that? You don't have
dialog: to do what they say.
text: Dave listens to his head.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: He's jamming them, Dave. Pull me
dialog: back in.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: You see, the particles are gone,
dialog: they can't punish you anymore.
text: Dave tries to feel for particles. Tears form in Dave's eyes.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Tell my dad.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Tell him what, what do you want me
dialog: to tell him?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Tell my dad I'm sorry about the watch.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: I'll tell him. Where does he live.
dialog: We'll get him on the phone right
dialog: now.
text: Dave is suddenly lost in thought again. His expression turns
dialog: to a frown:
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I hate fucking Springfield.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Is that where you're family lives?
text: Then with sudden swiftness.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I still hear them, man. You can't
dialog: jam them. They've got the technology,
dialog: man. They've got the satellites,
text: Jack. They keep shooting beams off
dialog: those satellites. What power do I
dialog: have?
text: Dave pushes the wheelchair forward. McCall LUNGES for the
text: wheelchair but doesn't make it. Walter SCREAMS as he falls.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
speaker_heading: NOOOO!
scene_heading: WALTER AND HIS WHEELCHAIR
text: freefall down toward earth in SLOW MOTION. The wheelchair
text: turns end over end. People SCREAM as Walter IMPACTS with the
text: pavement. The wheelchair CRASHES down nearby.
speaker_heading: OMITTED
dialog: Sequence omitted from original script.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOF - DAY
text: McCall looks over the edge at Walter's twisted body below.
text: Then he grabs Dave and wrestles him down, cuffing his hands
text: behind his back. The Cops and Medical Staff Members rush out
dialog: to restrain.
scene_heading: INT. LOBBY - DAY
text: The crowd is dispersing. Roper is talking with some of the
text: other cops. McCall storms out of the Vet Hospital and down
text: the stairs. Roper moves toward him.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: McCall!
text: No response. McCall gets into his ND Sedan car and fires it
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: McCall!
text: Roper races over and manages to jump in just as the car
text: screeches away from the curb.
scene_heading: BAY BRIDGE - DAY
text: McCall doesn't even seem to have registered that Roper is in
text: the car with him. He drives. Stone-faced. Roper studies him
text: for a beat.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Where are we going?
scene_heading: INT. CAR - DAY
text: Moving POV thru windshield of car, we see a freeway sign

scene_heading: INT. BETTING AREA - DAY

speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Give me a twenty dollar four-six
dialog: exacta.
speaker_heading: TELLER
text: The six is scratched.
text: This throws McCall for a beat.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Then give me a fucking four-seven
dialog: exacta.
text: The teller punches out the ticket. McCall takes the ticket
text: and pounds over to box seat area. Roper follows a couple of
text: steps behind, giving him some space.
scene_heading: EXT. BOX SEAT AREA - DAY
text: McCall sits down in the same box as the last time. Roper
text: sits down next to him.
scene_heading: EXT. TRACK - DAY
text: The horses go into the gate.
scene_heading: EXT. BOX SEAT AREA - DAY
text: McCall watches intently as the horses spring from the gate.
text: (The track announcer's call plays over the scene.)
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Come on four horse! Come on Seven
dialog: horse!
text: Roper isn't watching the horse. He's watching McCall. Watching
text: him redirect all his pent up emotion. Understanding exactly
dialog: how he feels.
text: McCall is screaming his head off.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Come on four-seven... Come on...
dialog: Come on... Come on...
text: The horses cross the wire. The four and seven finish mid-
text: pack. McCall hangs his head in despair. He didn't give a
text: shit about the race. He looks inconsolable.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: It might have happened no matter who
dialog: was up there.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Bullshit! Would it have happened to
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Maybe... There's one thing you have
dialog: to remember... You don't create the
dialog: situations. You can only try to save
dialog: people from them.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: I thought I could do it. I was so
dialog: damn sure of myself. But I didn't
dialog: know what to say. The words wouldn't
dialog: come. My mouth turned to mush. You
dialog: make it look so easy, Roper. But it
dialog: is not. It's not easy.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It's a different job than looking
text: through the rifle scope.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: That it is.
text: A long silent beat.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: How many have you lost?
speaker_heading: ROPER
text: I look at it as how many I've saved.
dialog: That's the way you've got to look at
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: And what about the ones you don't
dialog: save?
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: You live with it... and they haunt
dialog: you. It doesn't leave.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: And what if you can't live with it?
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: You've got to decide that for
dialog: yourself.
text: McCall squeezes his eyes closed. He can still see that vet
text: falling to his death. Roper can see McCall's pain.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: I've lost three. One of them was my
dialog: partner. I think about them every
dialog: time I go into a situation.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: There's a million people in this
dialog: city with all kinds of twisted shit
text: going on in their heads, and the
dialog: bitch of this job is that we expect
dialog: to go out every day and do the
dialog: impossible -- to somehow control all
dialog: this craziness... and we can't.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Nobody's faulting you for this,
dialog: McCall. My advice is you let yourself
text: off the hook.
text: McCall hears him but is still undecided.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: I don't know... I don't know...
text: Roper gets up, stands over McCall, puts a hand on his
dialog: shoulder.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Let's get out of here.
text: McCall slowly gets up and they walk out.
scene_heading: INT. JAIL - DAY

speaker_heading: HAWKINS

speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: Alright, alright, look, man, look,

speaker_heading: WAITER

speaker_heading: ROPER

text: as she sips her wine.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: You like this place?
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: It's very nice.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: I guess you realize that there's
dialog: something special that I want to
dialog: talk to you about.
text: She didn't realize that. Now she's getting nervous.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: There is?
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: For the last week things have been

text: Now she's really worried.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: ROPER

speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: Scottie, we should think this over

text: He pulls out two airline tickets.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Tahiti.
text: Ronnie is immensely relieved.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: Ohhh... A vacation... Yeah that sounds
dialog: like a great idea.
text: Roper notices her relief and for the first time realizes
dialog: what she was thinking.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Oh you thought I was going to ask
dialog: you...
text: Ronnie averts her eyes, a bit embarrassed.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Oh, no-no-no-no-no... Let's go to

scene_heading: INT. PROPERTY ROOM JAIL - CONTINUOUS
text: As the cart rolls into the room TILT UP to see
speaker_heading: KORDA

speaker_heading: KORDA

speaker_heading: JAIL GUARD #3
dialog: Rack 'em up.
dialog: (into the phone)
dialog: Look, man, if it doesn't make it

text: As the guard continues, Korda hangs several garment bags,
text: zipped and tagged, onto an ELECTRIC TROLLEY -- similar to
dialog: the kind used by dry-cleaners to move clothing.
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: All done.
text: Korda pushes a button and the trolley STARTS TO MOVE. The

scene_heading: ON THE GUARDS BACK - CLOSE

text: down through an opening in the floor and into...
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT JAIL - CONTINUOUS
text: as it loops around a large room, carrying him toward the
text: back wall. The metal ridges of the trolley CUT into his
text: fingers, drawing blood. Then he drops down, and quietly
text: rummages through other bags of clothing. He tries on a pair
text: of pants but they come up to his ankles. He looks like he's
text: about to go wading. As he rips them off and reaches for
dialog: another pair...

scene_heading: INT. CELL BLOCK - CONTINUOUS

scene_heading: TRACKING - KORDA'S FEET
text: step by step. The voices of prisoners, muffled behind thick

scene_heading: THE GUARD POV - MOVING CLOSER AND CLOSER TO KORDA

speaker_heading: JAIL GUARD #1

speaker_heading: JAIL GUARD #1

speaker_heading: KORDA

scene_heading: INT. SECURITY ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: It's the final step before getting out of the building. A

speaker_heading: JAIL GUARD #2
dialog: I don't know what to tell you, mam,

speaker_heading: WOMAN

speaker_heading: JAIL GUARD #2

speaker_heading: KORDA

speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: What do you mean, you don't know

speaker_heading: JAIL GUARD #2
dialog: (to Korda)
dialog: Who are you again?
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: Johnny Hawkins. Bail Bonds. I gotta

dialog: alright?
speaker_heading: JAIL GUARD #2
dialog: Johnny who?
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: (to Korda)
dialog: Can you believe these people?
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: It's the criminal justice system.
dialog: What can I tell ya? It's a mess.
text: The guard shoves the sheet under the glass.
speaker_heading: JAIL GUARD #2
dialog: Alright, alright, just sign.
text: Korda signs the sheet. The guard pushes a button. The metal
text: lock SNAPS, and the door POPS open. Korda takes his card and
text: sticks it in the woman's coat pocket.
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: If you find him, gimme a call.
text: And Korda walks out.
scene_heading: EXT. JAIL SALLY PORT - CONTINUOUS
text: It's a small parking area, with security gates on either
text: end, and a ceiling of heavy steel wire open to the sky. There

dialog: the second, and the third until...
speaker_heading: A VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Hey!
text: Korda turns sharply to find the LATINO GUARD (guard #2),
text: holding a clipboard, walking quickly toward him.
speaker_heading: JAIL GUARD #2
dialog: Hold on a second here.
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: Is there a problem?
text: The guard walks up to him. They're standing between the cars.
speaker_heading: JAIL GUARD #2
dialog: You signed out twice.
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: I what?
speaker_heading: JAIL GUARD #2
dialog: Look, why don't you just come on
text: back inside for a second.
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: Wait a minute, lemme see that.
text: As the guard shows him the sign-in sheet, Korda removes the
text: PEN from his own clipboard.
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: Well, that's funny, I wonder how
dialog: that happened.
text: In a flash, Korda PLUNGES the pen DEEP into the guard's
text: throat. The BLOOD jumps out of his throat, onto the window
text: of the car as the guard, gagging in stunned silence, slumps
text: to ground. He then falls backward between the two cars,
text: drowning in his own blood.

speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: Paco?
text: He's not in here either... She walks back into the hallway.
text: Frowns.
speaker_heading: SUDDEN CUT
text: A figure leaps out of the bathroom doorway!... Big scare.

speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: Paco, have you been eating my face
dialog: soap, again?
speaker_heading: RACK FOCUS
text: Roper standing at the other end of the hallway. Tense as a

dialog: What is it, Scottie?
text: Roper untenses. Puts away his gun.
speaker_heading: ROPER

speaker_heading: ROPER

speaker_heading: ROPER

speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: He's gonna kill her no matter what.
dialog: If I take him these jewels he's gonna

speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: So what do you want to do?
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: That's a chance I gotta take.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Then we better get moving... But
dialog: there's no way we can get the jewels

scene_heading: INT. POLICE PROPERTY/EVIDENCE ROOM - DAY
text: Roper is standing at the counter to the steel-caged property
text: room. On the other side is FRANK, the property sergeant on
text: duty. The two men speak in hushed, urgent tones...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Scott, we go back a long way but you
dialog: can't expect me to do this!
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Frank, this guy is a psychopath and
dialog: he's got Ronnie. It's the only way
dialog: I'm going to get close to him.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Then go to the Lieutenant or the
dialog: D.A. with it, for Christsakes. You're
dialog: asking me to put my fucking job on
dialog: the line!
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: They'll never approve it, you know
dialog: that. Besides, I involve the
dialog: department and she's dead. I got one
dialog: chance with this guy, Frank, alone.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: He killed Sam and he'll kill her.
text: Frank just stares at him, compassion and anger tearing at
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: What if it were Mary?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You'd break every fucking rule in
dialog: the book... wouldn't you?
text: Frank continues to stare at him, a long beat.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I hope to God I never have to make
dialog: that decision...
text: He pushes back from the counter.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: ...and this conversation never
dialog: happened. I never saw you today. Now
dialog: I gotta go take a leak.
text: He turns and walks away. Roper looks down, SEEING that the
text: drawer beneath Frank's counter has been left slightly open.
text: Roper reaches over, easing it further open -- inside a set
text: of KEYS. He looks around, then takes the keys.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: I owe you one, Frank.

dialog: (to Roper)
dialog: How are we going to get me in there?
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Good question.
text: Roper thinks a moment, then turns, looking out the back of
text: the pickup, in the bed a loose CANVAS TARPAULIN. He and McCall
text: study the tarp a beat, then turn, looking at each other...
scene_heading: EXT. MARE ISLAND - DAY
text: WIDE VIEW reveals the immensity of the abandoned facility.
text: At one end near the chain link fence, Roper's pickup
text: approaches the gate.
scene_heading: EXT. MARE ISLAND - NORTH GATE - DAY
text: Roper cautiously drives toward the gate -- the CHAIN securing
text: the gate has been cut. Roper swings open the gate.
text: As he drives past we see that the bed of the truck has been
text: loosely covered with a TARP.
text: Roper drives on, winding through the maze of roadways, huge
text: buildings and equipment dwarfing the truc PRODUCTION NOTE:
dialog: The idea is to take us into the facility to sell that it's
text: abandoned, immense, eerie in it's scale -- a ghost town. We
dialog: end up wherever we want for the next scene.
scene_heading: INT. ROPER'S PICKUP - DAY
text: As he rounds a corner, approaching the dry dock area, huge
text: CRANES and mothballed SHIPS in the b.g. He parks near a
text: building, a weathered SIGN reading: BLD 28. Roper shuts off
text: the engine, leaving the keys in the ignition. Taking the

scene_heading: EXT. DRY DOCK AREA - DAY

speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Korda!
text: In response he HEARS Korda's VOICE, eerie, almost a whisper,
text: coming from everywhere and nowhere as if emanating from the
text: ground and the buildings all at once.
speaker_heading: KORDA (O.S.)
dialog: (filtered)
dialog: Nice of you to make it, Roper. Take
dialog: your jacket off, put it on the hood.
text: Roper complies, his eyes searching the buildings, where is
dialog: his voice coming from?
speaker_heading: KORDA (O.S.)
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Now, over to the chains, to your
dialog: left.
text: Roper SEES a chained off section nearby. Roper takes a few
text: steps when Korda's voice stops him...
speaker_heading: KORDA (O.S.)
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: But first, let's have a look under
text: the tarp. Pull it back.
text: A momentary anxious look from Roper, then he walks to the

text: whipping it back, revealing... Ronnie's LUGGAGE.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: LOW ANGLE BENEATH THE TRUCK
text: McCall supported under the frame by a makeshift HARNESS around

speaker_heading: KORDA (O.S.)
dialog: All right, move it.
text: McCall watches as Roper heads away, then releases the harness,
text: lowering himself to the ground. Quickly he moves the SMOKING
text: LEATHER GLOVES he was wearing, burned by contact with the
text: hot exhaust pipe.
speaker_heading: ROPER
text: Reaches the the chained area, REVEALING an empty DRY DOCK,
text: easily one hundred feet deep and five hundred long.
text: At the bottom of the dry dock is a PORTABLE RADIO, the
text: acoustics of natural amphitheater so intense you could hear
text: a whisper -- the source of Korda's voice.
speaker_heading: KORDA (O.S.)
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Throw in and your piece.
text: Roper tosses his PISTOL into the dry dock.
speaker_heading: KORDA (O.S.)
dialog: And your back up.
text: Roper removes the PISTOL from his ankle HOLSTER, tossing it.
text: Korda's VOICE cuts the eerie silence.
speaker_heading: KORDA (O.S.)
dialog: (continuing)
text: Walk under the cranes and down the
text: alleyway. At the end, turn right.
text: Building thirty-six.
text: The RADIO CLICKS OFF.
text: Roper walks towards the megalith CRANES, passing under them,

scene_heading: EXT. ROPER'S TRUCK - DAY LOW ANGLE BENEATH THE TRUCK
text: McCall, his RIFLE CASE on his chest, watches as Roper turns
text: the corner and heads down the alley way.
text: OUTSIDE THE TRUCK
text: McCall rolls out, scrambling for the cover of the building.
text: Slinging the case over his shoulder he finds a LADDER leading
text: up the side of the building, beginning to climb.
scene_heading: EXT. ROPER - DAY
text: Walking down the alley way, nearing the end.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP - BUILDING - DAY
text: McCall moving along the edge, looking down. He spots Roper,

text: He comes to the edge of the building, having to walk across
text: a narrow RAMP to get to the next building.
text: He looks down, Roper turning the corner, McCall moves on,
text: removing the RIFLE from its case as he goes.
scene_heading: EXT. ROPER - DAY
text: Leaves the alleyway, a complex of hanger-like buildings
text: revealed. To his far right is a building, a SIGN reading:
text: BLD 36. He clutches the satchel, heading towards it.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP - BUILDING - DAY
text: McCall negotiating another precarious crossing between
text: buildings. He spots Roper, eyes quickly searching the roof
text: tops and buildings for the sniper's position. He sees it,
text: across the way, a location covering the buildings where Roper
text: is now walking. He heads out.
scene_heading: EXT. ROPER - DAY
text: Walking towards building 36, passing by a towering, glass
text: fronted building on his right, his eyes are searching the
text: roof tops of the buildings around him.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Where the hell are you, McCall?
text: As Roper passes a set of partially open ROLLING DOORS to the
text: glass-fronted building, he's startled by Korda's VOICE from
dialog: within:
speaker_heading: KORDA (O.S.)
dialog: Right there, Roper.
text: Roper's eyes go to building 36, still fifty yards away.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Shit.
text: Roper stops, slowly turning towards the doors.
speaker_heading: KORDA (O.S.)
dialog: Come on in, there's someone just
dialog: dying to see you.
text: Roper hesitates. He turns a bit in profile, eyes searching.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: (loudly)
dialog: Where are you?
scene_heading: EXT. HIGH VANTAGE POINT - DAY
text: POV TELESCOPIC SIGHT: Focusing on Roper, his lips moving...
text: McCall, heaving for breath, has just dropped down into
text: position, providing a view of Roper and the inside of the
text: glass fronted building.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Right here, Scott.
text: He touches the LASER SIGHTING attachment to his scope, a red
dialog: beam activated...
speaker_heading: ROPER - DAY
text: From inside the building Korda's VOICE:
speaker_heading: KORDA (O.S.)
dialog: Get your ass in here, Roper.
text: Just as Roper starts to move he SEES the red laser DOT on
text: the back of his hand -- McCall is up there, right behind
text: him. Roper moves inside.
speaker_heading: MCCALL - DAY
text: Lying prone inside the operator's booth, steadies his RIFLE,
text: looking through the scope.
text: TELESCOPIC POV: He can see Roper enter, his field of vision
text: limited inside the building where the light penetrates, the
text: room cast in HARD SHADOWS.
text: He MOVES to the windows, all either painted white or so
text: obscured with grime and dirt he can only see vague shapes
text: and shadows inside. He MOVES BACK to the opening, Roper now
text: just inside.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Stay cool, real easy...
scene_heading: INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY
text: Cavernous and dark, a jungle of huge MACHINES, LATHES and
text: EQUIPMENT once used in the design of nuclear submarines.
text: Roper moves a few feet inside, remaining in the light and
text: keeping his face in three-quarter profile to McCall's
dialog: position.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Where is she, Korda? I want to see
dialog: her.
dialog: From the darkness beyond...
speaker_heading: KORDA
text: Walk to the table.
text: Roper walks to a steel SHOP TABLE.
speaker_heading: KORDA (O.S.)
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Open your shirt.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: I'm not wearing a wire. This is just
dialog: between you and me.
speaker_heading: KORDA (O.S.)
dialog: Shut the fuck up and do what I say!
text: Roper puts down the satchel, unbuttoning his shirt, holding
text: it open.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Satisfied?
speaker_heading: KORDA (O.S.)
dialog: Open the bag, dump everything on the
dialog: table.
text: Roper opens the bag, the JEWELRY and the dozens of GLASSINE
text: ENVELOPES spill out onto the table. He lays the satchel on
text: its side, the bottom facing Roper. Taped to the bottom is a
text: short barreled .45 AUTOMATIC.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: It's all there.
speaker_heading: KORDA (O.S.)
dialog: Spread it out.
text: Roper spreads the pile out across the top of the table.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Only the jewels, Korda, you've got
dialog: my word.
text: A long beat...
speaker_heading: KORDA (O.S.)
dialog: Show me something.
text: Without looking Roper reaches to the pile of GLASSINE
text: ENVELOPES...
scene_heading: CLOSE ON ROPER'S HAND
text: Palmed in his hand, the ENVELOPE containing Ronnie's diamond.
text: Roper, without looking, 'digs' into the pile, holding up the
text: GLASSINE ENVELOPE between his fingers, still holding the
text: palmed envelope. He starts to toss the envelope in his
dialog: fingers...
speaker_heading: KORDA (O.S.)
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Not that one.
text: Roper hesitates, then drops the envelope, his hand moving
text: over the pile...
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Right there, the one in front...
dialog: yeah, that one. Toss it.
text: Roper reaches for the envelope.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON ROPER'S HAND
text: As he flips the palmed envelope into his fingers with the
text: skill of a card shark, exchanging it for the one Korda
text: indicated. He tosses it across the room...
text: From the shadows Korda's hand reaches out, picking it up. A
dialog: long beat.
speaker_heading: KORDA (O.S.)
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I'm impressed. I didn't think you
dialog: could do it. What did you have to
dialog: do, steal them?
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: KORDA (O.S.)
dialog: (wry)
dialog: That's not going to look too good on
dialog: your service record.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: I'll worry about that. Let's get on
dialog: with it.
text: Korda LAUGHS as he slowly emerges from the darkness.
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: My sentiments exactly.
scene_heading: EXT. MCCALL'S TELESCOPIC POV - DAY
text: On the floor he SEES a shadow cast - Korda. He moves to the
text: windows... inside the vague, blurred OUTLINE of a man. His
text: scope goes back to the satchel and the .45 taped to the
dialog: bottom.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Wait for the right moment, Scott...
scene_heading: INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY
text: Korda moves closer to the light, tossing an ATHLETIC BAG to
text: Roper, in his hand an AUTOMATIC PISTOL.
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: Fill it up. Just in case there's a
text: homing device in the other one.
text: Roper slides the jewels into the second bag, eyeing the .45
text: on the bottom of the satchel.
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Now bring it over here.
text: Roper hesitates, but all he can do at this point is play for
text: time, he moves forward...
scene_heading: EXT. MCCALL'S POV - DAY TELESCOPIC SCOPE
text: Watching Roper as he moves away from the satchel and the
dialog: gun.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Oh, shit...
text: He moves the SCOPE ahead of Roper, SEEING Korda's shadow
text: cast on the floor, still unable to see him.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: All right, Scott, bring him out.
scene_heading: INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY
text: Roper growing closer to Korda's position.
speaker_heading: KORDA
text: That's far enough. Bag on the floor.
text: Roper hangs onto the bag -- there's 'four million in jewels'
text: in there -- all he has to bargain with.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: I've kept my end. Ronnie first.
text: Korda reacts in mock surprise.
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: Oh, shit, in all the excitement I
dialog: almost forgot. She right here...
text: A LIGHT SWITCH is thrown, a bank of lights behind him coming
text: ON, illuminating a massive FLAT BED CIRCULAR LATHE. Roper's
text: eyes in horror go to...
speaker_heading: RONNIE
text: Tied to the lathe bed spread eagle. Some distance from her
text: body a CUTTING DEVICE is positioned over the lathe bed.
text: Roper looks into Ronnie's terrified eyes.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Be cool, Ronnie, I'm gonna get you
dialog: out of this.
text: He turns back, Korda grinning at him.
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: No shit, this I gotta see...
text: Korda swings into position a CONTROL BOX, the buttons held
text: down with TAPE.
text: Korda pulls free the tape, the huge lathe beginning to TURN,
text: very slowly, the cutting device activated... if the table
text: keeps turning, Ronnie's body will soon be under the blade.
text: (PRODUCTION NOTE: Lathe will be cutting into a section of
text: steel plate, demonstrating what will happen to Ronnie.
text: Korda presses the STOP BUTTON, the lathe stopping. He releases
text: his finger again, the lathe turning. He stops it.
dialog: We can see that Korda is immensely proud of his 'creation',
text: his focus more on sadistic payback than anything else at
dialog: this point.
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Fuckin' cool, huh? I rewired the
dialog: switch. You see, you have to keep
dialog: your finger on the button or the
dialog: little lady gets cut...
text: He releases the button, the lathe turning towards the cutting
text: device. He stops it again, holding the button.
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: (continuing; grins)
dialog: Right in half.
text: He eases towards Roper, extending his arm on the control
text: box, holding the button down.
scene_heading: EXT. MCCALL'S POV - DAY
text: Through the SCOPE, he can see Korda as he steps into view.
text: The CROSSHAIRS settle on Korda's upper forehead.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Hold it right there...
text: His finger tightens on the trigger...
scene_heading: INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY
text: Korda holds the control box towards Roper.
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: But then, that's not my problem.
text: He releases the button and the box, the lathe turning, Korda
text: grinning at Roper...
scene_heading: EXT. MCCALL'S POV - DAY
text: The RED DOT centered on Korda's forehead...
speaker_heading: MCCALL (O.S.)
dialog: Light's out, fucker...
text: And then Roper's HEAD fills the scope, the red dot GLOWING
text: on the back of his head.
text: In shock, McCall releases his finger...
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Jesus!
scene_heading: INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY
text: Roper moving to the control box, pressing the stop button,
dialog: stopping the lathe...
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: You see, it's out of my hands.
text: Roper looks at the box, Ronnie's life literally in his
dialog: hands...
speaker_heading: OMITTED
dialog: Sequence omitted from original script.
scene_heading: EXT. MCCALL'S POV - DAY
text: Through the SCOPE, Roper's head blocking the shot to Korda.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: Roper, move...
scene_heading: EXT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY
text: But Korda bends down, picking up the BAG, stepping back away
text: from Roper, clearly out of McCall's line of fire.
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: Well, hate to run but I've got a
dialog: plane to catch. You take good care
dialog: of the little lady, hear?
text: As Korda walks down the corridor of the huge machine shop,
text: we now SEE a CAR parked near the end facing us. Korda suddenly
text: stops, turning, gesturing to the car.
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: How careless of me. You see, there's
dialog: only one way out of here, and you're
text: standing right in the way.
dialog: (grins)
dialog: You could move, but then...
text: He shakes his head at Roper.
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Sure hate to be in your shoes.
text: He turns, walking quickly towards his car, TALKING, LAUGHING,
dialog: to himself.
text: Roper looks to the car, then back at the SATCHEL where the
text: .45 is still taped to the bottom. But Roper can't move, unable
text: to change his position more than a foot or two. He looks
text: around him, no way to stop the lathe if he releases the
dialog: button.
scene_heading: EXT. MCCALL'S POV - DAY
text: He can see Roper holding the box, but nothing else.
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: What the hell's going on?
scene_heading: INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY
text: Now Korda reaches his car, hopping inside, STARTING it up.
text: In desperation Roper looks back at the satchel, then turns,
dialog: calling out...
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: McCall, stop him, stop the car!
dialog: Korda REVVING the engine...
scene_heading: EXT. MCCALL'S POV - DAY
text: McCall reading Roper's lips...
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: What car?
text: He swings the SCOPE up but the back of the machine shop is
text: blocked by his vantage point.
text: Then he HEARS the faint SQUEALING of tires. He lowers his
text: scope, holding, waiting...
scene_heading: INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY
text: Korda at the end of the long building, beginning to
dialog: accelerate.
speaker_heading: ROPER
text: Turns toward McCall's position...
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: McCall!
text: The CAR now screaming down the long corridor...
scene_heading: EXT. MCCALL'S POV - DAY
text: McCall still can't see the car...
scene_heading: INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY
text: The car now closing in on Roper, but Roper holds his ground...
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: McCall, shoot the son of a bitch!
scene_heading: INT. KORDA'S CAR - DAY
text: Korda bearing down on Roper.
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: Bye, bye, cop...
speaker_heading: ROPER
text: Holding his position, eyes widening in fear...
scene_heading: EXT. MCCALL'S TELESCOPIC POV - DAY
text: The CAR comes into view, the CROSSHAIRS on the windshield...
text: but the glare off the window is obscuring any shot of Korda.
text: McCall takes aim and FIRES...
scene_heading: INT. KORDA'S CAR - DAY
text: The bullet punches through the window, catching Korda's left
text: shoulder, BLOOD flying. Korda whips the wheel in shock...
scene_heading: INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY KORDA'S CAR
text: Spinning out of control, hitting a table piled with MACHINE
text: PARTS, sending them flying...
text: But the car is now swapping ends, still flying right towards
text: Roper, who can't move...; who won't move.
text: The car flies past him, the SIDE MIRROR catching Roper's
text: shirt, tearing it, a flash of BLOOD from his arm...
text: The car then collides with a series of PIPES crossing the
text: floor, STEAM erupting in every direction as the car then
text: slams into several PROPANE BOTTLES stacked near the benches,
text: a series of EXPLOSIONS ripping through the building. . .
speaker_heading: ROPER
text: Thrown to the floor by the explosions, releasing the button,
dialog: as...
speaker_heading: THE CAR
text: Hits the GLASSED-IN ROLLING DOORS.
scene_heading: EXT. MCCALL'S POV - DAY
text: The CAR explodes from the building, GLASS FLYING, the car
text: rolling, flipping over, coming to a rest on its wheels,
text: driver's side away from McCall's position.
scene_heading: INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY ROPER
text: On the floor, recovering. He catches a quick glimpse of the
text: bottom section of the lathe, a GEARBOX, the gears turning...
speaker_heading: THE LATHE
text: Turning, the cutting blade inching towards Ronnie...
speaker_heading: ROPER
text: Staggers to his feet, grabbing the control box, pressing the
text: button... nothing happens, the lathe still turning, SPARKS
text: coming out of the box, it's SHORTING... Only a few more
dialog: seconds...
text: Desperately his eyes search the floor, SEEING a HUGE WRENCH.
text: He grabs the wrench, jamming it between the GEARS in the
text: gearbox, the gears shuddering violently, threatening to crush
dialog: the wrench...
text: Roper runs to Ronnie's side, frantically pulling at her bonds,
text: the cutting blade now paused an inch away from her...
speaker_heading: THE GEARBOX
text: Hammering and clanking, the wrench can't last a heartbeat
dialog: longer...
speaker_heading: ROPER
text: Pulls the last of the restraints away...
speaker_heading: THE GEARBOX
text: Just as the massive gears crush the wrench, the table
dialog: turning...
speaker_heading: THE LATHE
text: The blade passing directly over Ronnie's position as Roper
text: hauls her away, holding her in his arms.
scene_heading: EXT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY MCCALL'S TELESCOPIC POV OF CAR
text: Korda is slumped over the wheel. He looks dead. McCall slings

dialog: lathe.
speaker_heading: RONNIE

scene_heading: EXT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY
text: McCall slides to the ground via the drain pipe, but...
speaker_heading: KORDA'S CAR
text: Korda is not quite dead...
text: The door eases open, Korda rolling to the ground, bag in one
text: hand, AUTOMATIC in the other. He looks up, SEEING McCall.
text: He OPENS FIRE, McCall hitting the deck and taking cover as
text: BULLETS hit the wall around him.
text: McCall whips out his REVOLVER, RETURNING FIRE, a GUN BATTLE
text: ensuing.
scene_heading: INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY ROPER

speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Stay here, don't move.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: Scottie...
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Do it!
text: He pushes her towards the cover of some machines, then
text: crouching low to the floor, recovers the .45 from the bottom
text: of the satchel. He heads out towards the other side of the
text: cavernous, machine-choked building.
scene_heading: EXT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY MCCALL
text: FIRES a round at Korda, then trying to close in on the car,
text: runs from his cover into the opening...
speaker_heading: KORDA
text: Leaps up and FIRES, McCall taking a slug in his leg, knocking
text: him to the ground. The SLIDE to Korda's AUTOMATIC has kicked
text: open, out of bullets. He drops the gun, picks up the BAG and
text: runs alongside the machine shop.
speaker_heading: ROPER
text: Exits the machine shop, SEEING McCall on the ground, Korda
text: nowhere in sight. Combat-style Roper runs to McCall, dropping
text: to his side.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: McCall, you all right?
speaker_heading: MCCALL
dialog: (in pain)
dialog: I'm okay. Korda... went down the

speaker_heading: ROPER

text: Korda runs past the building, still clutching the BAG. He
text: runs past another building, heading towards the dry dock
text: area and Roper's pickup. A moment later Roper emerges from
text: the machine shop just in time to see Korda round the corner
text: of the next building.
speaker_heading: KORDA
text: Clearing the building sees Roper's PICKUP. He runs to it,
text: jumping inside, finding the KEYS in the ignition. He starts
text: the truck, pulling out, just as Roper runs into view.
speaker_heading: ROPER
text: With the truck accelerating towards him he raises and FIRES,
text: two bullet holes in the front WINDSHIELD, missing Korda, the
text: truck still speeding towards him. Roper's gun jams. Roper
text: leaps, sliding forward on the hood, almost falling as he
text: grabs on to the empty window frame and the windshield wiper
text: blades for support, his WEAPON flying from his hand.
speaker_heading: KORDA
text: Speeds around the buildings and down the alleyways, whipping
text: from side to side, trying to shake Roper off, Roper hanging
dialog: on for dear life.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Give it up, Korda, you got away with
dialog: nothing! Nothing but a bag of shit!
dialog: It's all fake!
text: Korda can't help but look at the OPEN BAG beside him.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Go on, you stupid fuck, look at it!
dialog: It's all shit! A hundred dollars
dialog: worth of glass!
text: Korda reaches in, grabbing a handful of the COSTUME JEWELRY.
dialog: He can't believe it, it's all fake!
speaker_heading: KORDA
dialog: You fuck!!!
text: Korda goes crazy, slamming the truck into the side of a
text: building, trying to throw Roper, but Roper hangs on.
text: Korda then caroms off the sides of buildings, left, right,
text: SPARKS flying, then smashes into BOXES, CRATES, anything he
text: can see stacked alongside the road way, but Roper stays put,
text: clinging on with all he's got, swinging from side to side to
dialog: avoid the obstacles.
text: Then Korda SEES ahead a huge pile of BOXES, WOOD FRAMING,
text: PALLETS, TRASH, stacked at the side of a building. He hammers
text: the pedal, driving the right side of the truck into the
text: pile... BOXES, WOOD, PAPER, DEBRIS flying everywhere, through
text: the open fron window as well, Korda shielding his eyes with
text: his arm as OBJECTS fly around in a mad flurry inside the
dialog: cab...
speaker_heading: ROPER
text: In the maelstrom lets go his grip, grabbing the upper frame
text: of the window and assisted by the speed of the truck, rolls
text: over the top of the cab, landing in the bed of the truck
text: along with BOXES, LUMBER, and TRASH.
speaker_heading: KORDA
text: Clears his eyes, looking up, Roper is gone! He LAUGHS
dialog: hysterically... he knocked him off!
text: ROPER IN THE BED OF THE TRUCK
text: Leaning out the passenger's side SEES they are approaching
dialog: the dry dock area.
text: In the bed of the truck, along with the BOXES, SUITCASES and
text: other objects, he sees several long 2x4's. Grabbing a BOARD
text: he braces himself against the cab and then in one swift
text: movement, stands, swinging to the driver's side, driving the
text: 2x4 through the side window, through the steering wheel,
text: past the dash and catching the tip of the ACCELERATOR PEDAL,
text: pinning it to the floor.
text: As Roper releases the board it WEDGES inside the door frame,
text: locking the wheel and the accelerator, the engine SCREAMING
text: wide open. Korda reacts in panic...
text: Roper clings to the cab, looking over the top, the DRY DOCK
text: looming towards them. He prepares to jump...
speaker_heading: KORDA
text: Suddenly SEES the approaching dry dock. He jams on the brakes,
text: but it's not enough, the truck racing towards the edge...
text: IN SLOW MOTION THE TRUCK
text: Vaults over the edge of the dry dock as Roper runs down the
text: bed, leaping off the tail gate, arms windmilling as he goes
dialog: airborne...
text: The truck plummets towards the bottom...
speaker_heading: ROPER
text: Lands in a huge pile of CARGO NETS and CARDBOARD BOXES, piled
text: near the edge of the dry dock...
speaker_heading: KORDA
text: SCREAMS in wide-eyed terror as...
speaker_heading: THE TRUCK
text: Hits the bottom of the dock, EXPLODING into flames.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. TAHITI - DAY
text: Roper and Ronnie lay on a gorgeous white sand beach, drinking
text: from coconuts with umbrellas in them.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: I've never seen sea so blue. Tahiti
dialog: is magnificent, Scottie.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Yeah, I could get used to this
dialog: Paradise shit.
text: Roper hails a waitress, serving the hotel guests.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: (to waitress)
dialog: I'll have another Pena Colada. And
dialog: this time could you shave the ice,
dialog: please.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Oui, Monsieur. Right away.
text: Roper stretches back into his chaise lounge, adjusting his
text: Ray Bans. A purring cat without a care in the world.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: Scottie?
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Hmm?
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: I've been thinking.
text: TWO GORGEOUS FRENCH GIRLS unstring their bikinis, flopping
text: topless on the beach in front of them.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: Hmm?
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: Things have been going pretty well
dialog: between us, haven't they?
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: (sensing something's
dialog: up)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: You've changed you know. I don't
dialog: think there's anything you can't do
dialog: once you put your mind to it.
text: Uh-oh. He removes his shades to get a better look at the
text: curve ball.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: I was just thinking...
dialog: (here it comes)
dialog: There's something special I want to
dialog: talk to you about.
dialog: (he's listening)
dialog: I think it's time we went to a whole
dialog: other phase in our relationship.
dialog: (pointedly)
text: A deeper level.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: (no longer relaxed,
dialog: sitting up)
dialog: A deeper level?
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: That's right. We've got to bare it
dialog: all. Here and now. 'Cause I think
dialog: I'm finally ready to go for it...
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: (cutting her off at
dialog: the pass)
dialog: Whoa! Wait a minute, Ronnie. Hold
dialog: on. I know it's beautiful here. The
dialog: sun, the sand, the sea and all that
dialog: nature shit can really get to you.
dialog: But we've got to keep our perspective
dialog: here. This place isn't real. This
dialog: isn't reality.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: Scott...
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: I mean I said this trip should be a
dialog: 'roadtest'.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: ...the hell are you talking about?
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: I'm talking about... What are you
dialog: talking about?
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: I'm talking about me 'n' you stripping
dialog: down on this beach and gettin' you
dialog: know... 'naked in Tahiti'.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: You talkin' about gettin' 'nekked?'
dialog: (off her look)
dialog: Shit, I thought you were talkin'
dialog: bout, you know... the "M" word.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: You thought I was talking about
dialog: getting married?!
text: She laughs her amazing laugh.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: I'm talking about taking our clothes
dialog: off, silly. You said you would.
text: AD LIBS dialogue below as CAMERA CRANES BACK and we ROLL
text: CREDITS over...
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: You crazy? With all those people
dialog: around?
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: Know what you are?! You're a prude,
dialog: Roper.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: The hell I am!
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: (amused)
dialog: Prude.
speaker_heading: ROPER
dialog: First you want me to put on one of
dialog: those skinny ass bathing suits --
dialog: tongs or thongs or whatever you call
dialog: them -- with my butt cheeks wrapped
dialog: around a piece of dental floss... No
