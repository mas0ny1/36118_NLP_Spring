dialog: 
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: THE HIGHWAY - DAY
text: Georgia. Two-lane blacktop, stretching from here to heaven.
text: Empty. Silent. Then, suddenly in the far distance, several
text: dark specks rise over a hill and head straight toward camera.
text: Camera holds and the specks begin to take form. Vehicles.
text: Trucks. Six monstrous eighteen-wheel diesels, coming at us,
text: their smokestacks blasting. Sound grows louder, as we begin
text: to hear snatches of Citizens Band Radio talk over:
speaker_heading: VOICE ONE
dialog: -- Breaker, this is Banana Peel...
speaker_heading: VOICE TWO
dialog: -- Yeah, Breaker go head on.
speaker_heading: VOICE ONE
dialog: -- Thanks much. I'd like to get me a
dialog: Smokey report?
speaker_heading: VOICE TWO
dialog: -- Road looks clean as a hound's
dialog: tooth.
speaker_heading: VOICE ONE
dialog: -- Okey, doke. Last one to the Roadeo
dialog: is a homo.
text: Voices fade and titles and credits begin. "Black Smoke Blowing
text: Over Eighteen Wheels" by Red Simpson comes up in the b.g. as
text: the six trucks blast right over camera.
speaker_heading: AN AERIAL VIEW
text: of the trucks driving through an entrance gate to a huge
text: parking lot. Over the gate is a sign reading: "GEORGIA TRUCK
text: ROADEO STATE FINALS." Music and credits continue.
scene_heading: TRUCK ROADEO - PARKING LOT - DAY
text: Macks, Kenworths, Whites and Jimmys, all polished to a
text: mirrored finish. Truck drivers decked out in their flashiest
text: western outfits. The stands filled with spectators on the
text: edge of their seats, watching the gearjammers put their rigs
dialog: through tests of skill and reflexes -- parallel parking,
text: driving around eggs, through complicated barricades, etc.
scene_heading: CAMERA PICKS UP
text: a customized white Cadillac convertible pulling into the
text: Roadeo grounds. The Caddy has mounted chrome quarter horses
text: on each front fender, bull horns on the front bumper, stacked
text: rifles displayed in the rear. Garish. The car's Texas license
text: plate reads "Mr. Big."
speaker_heading: CLOSER ANGLE
text: The Cadillac stops. Two men climb out and wend their way
text: through the trucks and spectators. Camera tracks behind them.
text: Although we can't see their faces, we see that one man is
text: pudgy and decked out in a fancy white western suit and hat.
text: The other is younger, tall, skinny and wearing a grey western
text: suit and hat. Kyle Brand and his son Dickey.
scene_heading: MUSIC AND CREDITS FADE
scene_heading: ANGLE - ROADEO INFIELD
text: The crowd roars, as the trucks race through an obstacle
dialog: course.
scene_heading: ANGLE - THE MEN - TRACKING
text: Camera still on their backs.
speaker_heading: DICKEY
dialog: (referring to race)
dialog: Is that Bandit in the lead?
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: If that sumbitch was in the race,
dialog: he'd be in the winner's circle by
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: DICKEY
dialog: I still think this whole idea is
dialog: dumb, pop.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Then it must be a helluva idea.
text: Kyle laughs. His laugh then turns into a hacking cough.
speaker_heading: DICKEY
dialog: Why don't we just rent a Lear jet
dialog: and haul it back ourselves?
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Because I wanna see this hot shot
dialog: Bandit do something that can't be
dialog: done. Besides, there's nothing I
dialog: like better than breaking legends.
text: He laughs, coughs again, continues walking.
speaker_heading: DICKEY
dialog: (not getting it)
dialog: But if it can't be done, how's he
dialog: gonna do it?
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: That's the point, Dickey.
speaker_heading: DICKEY
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Now, you just find him, son.
speaker_heading: DICKEY
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: Dickey crosses to a trucker couple, polishing up their chromed
dialog: rig.
speaker_heading: DICKEY
dialog: Say, hoss. Where might I locate the
dialog: Bandit?
speaker_heading: HUSBAND
dialog: Ain't seen him.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: (immediately)
text: Over there behind his rig.
text: The Husband shoots his old lady a jealous look. Dickey rejoins
text: Kyle and they head toward Bandit LaRue's truck.
scene_heading: NEW ANGLE - MOVING
text: as they come to the only battered, beaten-up eighteen-wheeler
text: at the entire Truck Roadeo. It looks like it hasn't been
text: washed since it left the showroom.
text: On one side of the truck is a faded and peeling mural of a
text: stagecoach being held up. A teamster and a shotgun guard
text: have their hands high in the air and a Bandit on horseback
text: has a six-gun pointed at them.
text: An elaborate CB radio antenna grows out of the cab beside
text: the driver's door.
scene_heading: ANGLE - KYLE AND DICKEY - FROM BEHIND
text: as they round the truck and stop in their tracks.
scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE - WHAT THEY SEE
text: A hammock is stretched from the cab of the truck to an oak
text: tree. A man wearing a faded denim western shirt, open with
text: the sleeves rolled up, levis and silver-toed cowboy boots is
text: lying in the hammock. A cowboy hat covers his face.
speaker_heading: CLOSER ANGLE
text: as shadows fall across the figure. The man slowly tips back
text: his hat and we see he's in his thirties, boyishly handsome,
text: with a cocky smile. Bandit LaRue.
speaker_heading: FULL SHOT
text: And for the first time we get a look at Kyle and Dickey.
text: Kyle is wearing sunglasses and diamond rings on every finger.
text: His smile is as tasteless as the suit he wears.
text: Dickey is in his early twenties. Blonde, blue-eyed and scared
text: to death of his old man.
text: Bandit looks at them for a moment, then casually pulls the
text: hat back over his face.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Aw, ain't you glad to see me, Bandit?
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (hat over his face)
dialog: Yeah, it's the highlight of my day.
text: There's a long pause interrupted by Kyle's hacking cough.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: (to Dickey)
dialog: What's he get if he wins here?
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (hat over his face)
dialog: If...?
speaker_heading: DICKEY
dialog: Five thou.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Chickenshit money.
text: Kyle coughs again.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (hat over his face)
dialog: Could you turn your head?
text: Bandit gets up and begins untying the hammock from the tree.
text: Kyle crosses to him.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: Look, Kyle; I ain't in this Truck
dialog: Roadeo for the money. It's the
dialog: challenge. You know, the ecstasy of
text: victory, the agony of defeat.
text: Kyle looks out at the cheering crowd.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: I can't believe there's two thousand
dialog: people here to watch a bunch of guys
text: back up their trucks.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: America's bored.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Now, what do you want?
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: You to forget this dumbass Roadeo
dialog: and take on a real challenge.
text: As Bandit turns to him, we:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: BANDIT'S TRUCK - DAY
text: Bandit, wearing aviator shades and his cowboy hat, is backing
text: the truck up and shouting down to Kyle and Dickey on the
dialog: ground.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: You're crazy, man. Smart dresser,
dialog: but crazy.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: What's the matter? Legend has it
text: Bandit LaRue's king of the road.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: I can make it to Texarkana and back
dialog: in twenty-eight hours... that's no
dialog: sweat.
speaker_heading: DICKEY
dialog: It ain't ever been done before, hot
dialog: shit.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
text: (smiles at Dickey,
dialog: then)
dialog: See, running Coors Beer east of Texas
dialog: is what bothers me. It makes me a
dialog: bootlegger.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: I hear a few weeks ago you smuggled
text: sixteen Beaners up to West Virginia.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: You know how rumors start.
speaker_heading: DICKEY
dialog: I think you're just yellow.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: Wonderful psychology. Why don't you
dialog: say something about my mom?
dialog: (then)
dialog: Excuse me.
text: Bandit drives toward the starting line for another event.
text: Kyle and Dickey run alongside.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: (coughs, then)
dialog: Look, you make this little run for
dialog: me, I'll buy you a new rig.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (indicating truck)
dialog: Last year, this was a new rig.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: But it wasn't a Kenworth.
text: Dickey turns to his father, stunned, as Bandit stops the
dialog: truck.
speaker_heading: DICKEY
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: Pop, a K-Whopper's worth seventy
dialog: thou.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (correcting)
dialog: Seventy-two five.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Why do you want this barley pop so
dialog: bad?
speaker_heading: DICKEY
dialog: He's thirsty.
text: Bandit smiles at Dickey again.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: I got a boy running in the Peach
dialog: Tree Classic tomorrow and when he
dialog: wins, I wanna celebrate in style.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: How much style?
speaker_heading: KYLE
text: Four hundred cases worth.
dialog: (a long pause)
dialog: Well?
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: You paying for the gas?
text: Kyle smiles that unwinning smile and takes out a huge wad of
dialog: bills, as we:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: GEORGIA COUNTRYSIDE - DAY
text: Picturesque. Bandit's eighteen-wheeler rolling down the
text: Georgia highway, past lush green meadows and endless acres
text: of pines.
dialog: Over this:
speaker_heading: A WOMAN'S VOICE
dialog: Whaddya mean, we're not going to the
dialog: show tonight?
scene_heading: INSIDE THE TRUCK (DIALOGUE OVERLAPS)
text: And for the first time, we get a real look inside the rig.
text: It's quite a set-up. The opposite of the outside. Home on
dialog: the road.
text: Sheepskin over the two front seats, a poster of Raquel Welch
text: in a bikini tacked above the windshield, under which is a
text: bumper sticker reading: "Do It For Truckers." On the dash
text: board, a St. Christopher medal and a chattering skull. Also,
text: a stereo tape deck and the best Citizens Band Radio outfit
dialog: money can buy.
dialog: Bandit is on the C.B.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: Hot Pants, I got no choice. I gotta
text: make a run to Texarkana. Over.
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
dialog: (over CB)
dialog: But you been promising to take me
dialog: for three weeks.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: Baby, I...
speaker_heading: MALE VOICE
dialog: (over CB)
dialog: Break. Break.
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
dialog: (over CB)
dialog: Yeah, breaker; come on.
speaker_heading: MALE VOICE
dialog: (over CB)
dialog: Hot Pants, this here is Sugar Man.
dialog: I'll take you to the show tonight.
dialog: Pick you up at seven. How am I hitting
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
dialog: (over CB)
dialog: Bull's-eye, Sugar Man. Bandit?
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
dialog: (over CB)
dialog: Go sit on a cold carrot.
text: Bandit looks at the mike and we:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY
text: Bandit's truck pulls to a stop in front of a small white
text: clapboard house.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: A FEW MINUTES LATER - INSIDE THE HOUSE
text: Most of the furniture is old and what isn't, is covered with
text: plastic. No fancy carpets or objects d'art. On the coffee
text: table is an open, colorfully illustrated Bible. A blonde
text: wood television set sits in a corner of the room. There are
text: a lot of toy trucks lying around and over the mantel is an
text: oil painting of a fancy eighteen-wheeler with an epitaph
dialog: under it reading: "I'd rather be a truck driver, than be a
dialog: millionaire..."
text: Bandit is trying to get into the bedroom, but his path is
text: being blocked by a faded Georgia beauty lost somewhere in
dialog: her thirties. Waynette Snow.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (trying to get past
dialog: her)
dialog: Goddamn, Waynette; you sure do look
dialog: foxy today. If you weren't already
dialog: married, I'd...
speaker_heading: WAYNETTE
dialog: Don't give me that horseshit, Bandit.
dialog: You ain't seeing him.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (determined)
dialog: Yes, I am.
speaker_heading: WAYNETTE
dialog: (equally determined)
dialog: No, you ain't.
text: A scrawny little Kid runs through the room, followed by an
dialog: even scrawnier mutt.
speaker_heading: SCRAWNY KID
dialog: Hi, Uncle Bandit.
speaker_heading: WAYNETTE
dialog: (turning to Kid)
dialog: He ain't your damn uncle and get
dialog: that mutt outta here. He just peed
dialog: all over my hot curlers!
text: Bandit takes the moment to slide past Waynette and duck into
dialog: the bedroom.
speaker_heading: THE BEDROOM
text: is dark. The venetian blinds are drawn. Bandit hurries into
text: the room with Waynette still hollering in the b.g.
text: He passes a French Provincial dresser with a small fleet of
text: model trucks on top and crosses to a Lump sleeping face down
text: on a double bed.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (shaking the Lump)
dialog: Cledus.
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: (not moving)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (shaking him again)
dialog: Wake up, man; I just got us a hot
dialog: run for big bucks.
text: Bandit goes to the closet and begins tossing clothes onto
dialog: the bed.
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: (slowly rolling over)
dialog: Whadda we have to do -- kidnap the
dialog: Pope?
speaker_heading: BANDIT (O.S.)
dialog: (from closet)
dialog: How'd you know?
text: He comes out of the closet with the rest of the clothes and
text: tosses them on the bed, then crosses to the dresser drawer
text: and throws a pair of socks and underwear at Cledus.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: Look, all we gotta do is make a run
dialog: to Texarkana...
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: ...in twenty-eight hours.
text: Cledus Snow slowly comes up from under the covers and we get
dialog: our first glimpse of him. He's thirty-three, but you'd never
dialog: take him for a day under forty. Trucker all the way. He's
text: wearing boxer shorts and an undershirt. As he reaches across
text: to the nightstand and puts on a pair of glasses:
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: Twenty-eight hours! You're outta
dialog: your gord.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: Is that any way to talk to your ole
dialog: partner?
dialog: (pulling back blanket)
dialog: Look, it's only nine hundred miles
dialog: each way.
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: (figuring quick)
dialog: That means we gotta average ninety-
dialog: four miles per.
dialog: (lying back down)
dialog: Forget it.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: No one's ever done it before. This'll
dialog: put us on the map.
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
text: Or in the slammer.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: Did I tell you they're gonna give us
dialog: a brand new Kenworth?
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: (sitting up)
dialog: Waynette!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: OUTSIDE CLEDUS' HOUSE - DAY
text: Bandit sits inside the cab of the truck, nervously tapping
text: his foot and watching Cledus' kids play football on the front
text: lawn. The mutt keeps getting in their way.
text: Bandit hits the horn and an instant later, Cledus steps onto
text: the front porch, followed by Waynette. He's wearing a plaid
text: shirt, levis, a large engraved cowboy belt and a thermal
dialog: vest.
speaker_heading: WAYNETTE
dialog: (handing him a thermos)
dialog: This ain't fair. You're letting him
dialog: talk you into this.
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: (buttoning shirt)
dialog: I swear to God, pumpkin; I'll be
dialog: back before you know it.
dialog: (sly smile)
dialog: And then I'll make you glad you was
dialog: born a woman.
speaker_heading: WAYNETTE
dialog: Well, I just might not be waiting
dialog: this time.
text: Bandit toots again. Waynette gives him "the finger."
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: Honey, please... Don't be this way.
dialog: You know I'd do anything for you.
speaker_heading: WAYNETTE
dialog: Anything?
text: Cledus nods.
speaker_heading: WAYNETTE
dialog: Take Fred.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: GEORGIA HIGHWAY - LATE AFTERNOON
text: The eighteen-wheeler heading west, stacks open.
dialog: Over:
speaker_heading: CLEDUS (V.O.)
dialog: Believe me, man; Fred'll be no
dialog: problem.
speaker_heading: BANDIT (V.O.)
dialog: Yeah, I can tell he's gonna be a
dialog: major asset.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE CAB (DIALOGUE OVERLAPS)
text: Fred, the mutt, lays with his head slumped over Bandit's
text: leg. Cledus is at the wheel, wearing clip-on sunglasses.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: All right, Fred; enough fun.
text: Bandit picks Fred up and dumps him onto the sleeper
text: compartment behind the seats. Then, starts going over a road
dialog: map.
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: You know of course, we ain't ever
dialog: gonna make it.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (not looking up)
dialog: Quit being so negative, guy; 'course
dialog: we're gonna make it. We ain't never
dialog: not made it, have we?
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: See.
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: Our asses gonna be in a sling if we
dialog: get caught.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
text: (looking up, straight
dialog: to him)
dialog: And if we don't, they're gonna be
text: riding high in a brand new Kenworth.
text: As "Truck Driving Man" by Red Steagall starts over, Cledus
text: looks at Bandit, sighs -- then punches it.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE THRU TO:
scene_heading: A SERIES OF LAP DISSOLVES - THE EIGHTEEN-WHEELER
text: roaring down the highway. Music continues, as slowly day
text: becomes night and the truck whizzes across the Alabama and
dialog: Mississippi State Lines.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE THRU TO:
scene_heading: THE HIGHWAY - NIGHT
text: The rig is parked on the shoulder under a highway light.
text: Bandit and Cledus stand by the side of the truck, as Fred
text: wanders aimlessly around the grassy knoll off the shoulder.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (snapping his fingers
dialog: impatiently)
dialog: How long's this gonna take?
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: I don't know, man. Ask him?
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (nervously)
dialog: We gotta let the slack out, Cledus;
dialog: this is costing us time.
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: If you ask me, I think we should
dialog: make that run to Choo Choo Town and
dialog: pick up that load of lumber. Nice.
dialog: Easy. And within the law.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: Also boring.
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: But I still don't think...
text: Bandit walks away from Cledus in mid-sentence, heading for
text: the rear of the truck.
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: What are you doin' now?
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (starting to open
dialog: rear doors)
text: Running blocker.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: THE BACK DOORS OF THE TRUCK
text: As Bandit swings them open, Cledus adjusts one of two ramps
text: that have now been mounted on the rear of the truck's floor.
text: As Cledus kicks the ramp into place, Bandit climbs into the
text: back of the trailer and disappears.
text: After a moment, there is a deafening roar and suddenly, two
text: headlights are GLARING straight at camera.
speaker_heading: NEW ANGLE
text: A beat and slowly, a full-blown SHELBY COBRA II appears from
text: inside the truck. As it moves slowly down the ramp, we see
text: it has twelve coats of black lacquer, red pinstriping,
text: aluminum mags, twelve-inch Firestones, the works. A mean
dialog: machine.
text: On the rear bumper is a CB antenna matching the one on the
dialog: truck.
speaker_heading: CAMERA FOLLOWS
text: as Bandit guides the Cobra down the ramp. Cledus quickly
text: folds up the ramp and dumps it back into the truck. He slams
text: the metal doors closed and crosses to the Cobra.
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: All right, here's our plan of
dialog: communication, so as to avoid Smokey.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: Go.
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: Now, if I say go to channel three,
dialog: it really means go to six.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (nods)
dialog: Six. Got it.
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: If I say go to twenty-one, go to
dialog: nineteen.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (trying to remember)
text: Twenty-one is nineteen.
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: If I say go to two, it's really one.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (now totally confused)
dialog: Two is one.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Listen, let's just stay on the odd
dialog: channels and switch everytime. Start
dialog: in the basement. Now, let's haul
dialog: ass.
text: Cledus grabs Fred, who's still peeing and bounds up the metal
text: steps of the cab. As Bandit lays twenty feet of rubber, we:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: MISSISSIPPI HIGHWAY - NIGHT
text: The Cobra followed by the Eighteen-wheeler whip past camera.
dialog: (NOTE: From this point on, the Cobra will be referred to as
dialog: Bandit I. The Eighteen-wheeler as Bandit II.)
speaker_heading: INSIDE BANDIT I (THE COBRA)
text: The car is cherry. Wooden steering wheel, all leather
text: upholstery stereo tape deck, harness-style seat belts and a
text: CB radio identical to the one in Bandit II.
text: Bandit is talking to Cledus on the CB.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: Bandit One, am I hitting you?
scene_heading: INTERCUT - BANDIT II (THE EIGHTEEN-WHEELER)
text: Cledus picks up his mike. Fred is now riding shotgun.
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: You're wall to wall and tree top
dialog: tall.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: I'm gonna run a couple miles ahead
dialog: of you. Keep both feet on the floor.
dialog: We'll be moving ninety and over.
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: (into mike; after a
dialog: beat)
dialog: Bandit?
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: Why are we doing this?
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (a beat, then into
dialog: mike)
dialog: Because they said it couldn't be
dialog: done.
dialog: And:
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: THE HIGHWAY - NIGHT
text: Bandit I and II screaming through the Mississippi night.
text: Over this a driving Doug Kershaw fiddle.
scene_heading: INSIDE BANDIT
text: Bandit driving, sipping coffee from a thermos. Sees something.
scene_heading: HIS VIEW - UP AHEAD
text: A Mississippi Highway Patrol Car is approaching from the
text: opposite direction.
text: BACK TO BANDIT
text: as he eases up on the pedal and fires up his CB mike.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: Bandit Two, do you read me?
text: Bandit glances up in his rear view mirror.
scene_heading: ANGLE - THROUGH REAR VIEW MIRROR
text: The Mississippi HPC, zips past Bandit and moves on down the
dialog: highway.
scene_heading: INTERCUT - BANDIT I AND II (DIALOGUE OVERLAPS)
text: Cledus picks up his mike.
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: (into mike)
text: Loud and clear.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: Pull your hammer back, Smokey's coming
dialog: at you.
text: Cledus immediately backs off the accelerator and slows down,
text: an instant before the Mississippi HPC passes by. Everything
dialog: is cool.
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: He's history.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: Okay, we got a straight shot to T
dialog: Town, so let her roll.
dialog: And we:
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: SERIES OF SHOTS
text: As night slowly begins fading back into day, Bandit I and
text: Bandit II blast across the Arkansas State Line.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: THE SUN RISING
text: behind a sign that reads: Welcome to Texarkana, Texas. A
text: beat and two blurs whip past camera. Bandit I and II.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: THE WAREHOUSE - DAWN
text: Bandit I followed by Bandit II pull into the loading area of
text: a large warehouse.
text: The place is locked up and the loading dock is empty. Bandit
text: and Cledus park their vehicles and climb out.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: Shit! No one's here.
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: (checking watch)
dialog: That's 'cause we're damn near an
text: hour ahead of schedule.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: Let's keep it that way.
text: Bandit grabs a crowbar from Bandit I and we:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INSIDE THE WAREHOUSE
text: Pitch black. A beat, then a loud smash o.s. and the door
text: slides open, sending a stream of light across the warehouse
dialog: floor.
text: Bandit and Cledus step inside. Bandit crosses to the light
text: switch and hits it. Suddenly the entire room is bathed in
text: flourescent. We see the warehouse is filled with cases upon
dialog: cases of Coors Beer.
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: (whistles low)
dialog: Liquid gold.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (nods)
dialog: Redneck heaven.
text: They cross back to the large sliding door and as Bandit pushes
text: it open, Cledus jumps into the truck's cab and begins backing
text: the big rig up to the loading dock.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: THE WAREHOUSE - A FEW MINUTES LATER
text: The rig's doors are open and ready for loading. Cledus and
text: Bandit cross to a brand new fork-lift.
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: You know how to drive one of these
dialog: things?
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: Can a pig whistle?
text: Bandit climbs into the seat of the fork-lift and turns the
text: key. The engine roars to life. He grins and confidently throws
text: it into gear. The fork-lift leaps backward and begins speeding
text: wildly around the warehouse.
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: Hit the brakes!
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: They're jammed!
scene_heading: RUNNING ANGLE - FOLLOWING THE FORK-LIFT
text: as it smashes into stacks of Coors cases, sending them flying
text: in every direction and tossing Bandit out of the seat -- and
text: into the air.
speaker_heading: NEW ANGLE
text: as Bandit crashes to the ground, surrounded by cases of beer.

speaker_heading: BANDIT

speaker_heading: CLEDUS

speaker_heading: BANDIT

speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (into mike)
text: Clear and rolling.
text: He hangs up the mike, then sees something ahead of him he
dialog: can't believe.
speaker_heading: WHAT HE SEES
text: Standing in the middle of the highway is a GIRL in a wedding
text: gown. Off to the side, on the shoulder, is a customized Camaro
text: with a "Just Married" sign on the back and strings of tin
text: cans, shoes and streamers. The hood of the Camaro is up.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: as Bandit eases off the accelerator and starts to move around
dialog: the Girl.
text: But the Girl moves with him, waving and blocking his path.
text: Bandit's forced to pull off the road and stop. The Girl rushes

speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: (climbing in)
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (it was nothing)
dialog: Hey...
text: The Girl slams the door and turns to Bandit. She's tall and

speaker_heading: McCONNELL.
speaker_heading: FULL SHOT

scene_heading: INSIDE BANDIT I - DAY - MOVING
text: picking up speed.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: Who's the unlucky guy?
text: Kate takes off her veil and shakes down her hair. She's a
text: beauty. Bandit immediately notices, but keeps driving. She
text: starts talking a mile-a-minute.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Okay. I was in Texas dancing in an
dialog: industrial show for Sunkist Oranges.
dialog: They say I'm the new Anita Bryant.
dialog: But I'm really a dancer from New
dialog: York. A lot of credits. Moderate
dialog: talent.
dialog: (rolling on)
dialog: Anyway, after opening night, I was
text: walking back to the motor lodge and
text: suddenly there he was. A tall Texan
text: with a twenty-nine inch waist. Pure
dialog: dynamite.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: All sound reasons for matrimony.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Look, I'm a twenty-eight year old
dialog: hoofer who spends most of her time
dialog: with fags. Besides, I'm impulsive.
dialog: It runs in the family. We're all
dialog: crazy. Mind if I smoke?
dialog: (lights a cigarette)
dialog: Anyway, today was the 'bid day.' But
text: as I was walking down the aisle, I
dialog: realized this is total insanity.
dialog: What am I going to do in Texas the
dialog: rest of my life? I can't marry Jerry
dialog: Jeff. I mean, we're eventually gonna
dialog: have to talk. So, halfway down the
dialog: aisle, I turned and split. You think
dialog: I'm nuts, right?
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: Absolutely not. In fact, I picked up
dialog: a bride yesterday; except she was a
dialog: singer.
text: Suddenly, Cledus interrupts over the CB.

speaker_heading: NEW ANGLE

speaker_heading: FIRST KID
dialog: (pleading)
dialog: I swear to God, officer; the car

speaker_heading: CLAYTON
dialog: Did you see the gal who was driving?
text: She was wearing a wedding dress.
text: They all nod, still shaking in their jeans.
speaker_heading: SECOND KID
dialog: (eagerly)
dialog: Yes, sir. She got into a cherry-

speaker_heading: CLAYTON
dialog: You get a look at the driver?
speaker_heading: FIRST KID
dialog: No, but he had Georgia plates. BAN-
dialog: ONE.
text: Clayton turns on his heels and leaps back into the Sheriff's

speaker_heading: BANDIT

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Who'd want to?
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: I never looked at it that way.

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Why are you doing this obviously

speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: For a new Kenworth. That's a truck.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (incredulous)
dialog: A truck? You're doing this for a

speaker_heading: BANDIT
text: It's not a truck. It's the Rolls

speaker_heading: KATE

speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: Hey, you could get killed crossing

speaker_heading: KATE

speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: Driving?
speaker_heading: KATE

speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: They're both a challenge.
speaker_heading: KATE

speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: Yeah, I do. Especially from that

text: She laughs. Then:
speaker_heading: KATE

speaker_heading: BANDIT

speaker_heading: BANDIT

scene_heading: WHAT HE SEES - THROUGH REAR VIEW MIRROR

speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: Better fasten your seat belt.

speaker_heading: KATE

scene_heading: DIRT ROAD - DAY

dialog: pursuit. Over this:
speaker_heading: KATE (V.O.)
dialog: What the hell's going on?
speaker_heading: BANDIT (V.O.)
dialog: I forget to tell you. I'm running
dialog: blocker for four hundred cases of

dialog: A beat, then:
speaker_heading: KATE (V.O.)
dialog: And I thought I had problems.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE HIGHWAY PATROL CAR - MOVING
text: The windshield of the car is covered with dust. The Officer

text: Finally, he turns on his windshield wipers, making the dust
text: twice as thick. And now he can't see anything.
scene_heading: INSIDE BANDIT I - MOVING
text: Bandit looks over his shoulder. Nothing but a solid wall of
text: dust. He whips the Cobra around a hairpin turn and floors
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: NEW ANGLE
text: The Highway Patrol Car misses the turn and goes off the road.
text: Out of control, the car smashes through a clapboard fence
dialog: and sails into:
speaker_heading: A SWAMP

scene_heading: INSIDE BANDIT I

speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: Anything?
speaker_heading: KATE

dialog: We're cool. The dumb schmuck took

speaker_heading: KATE

speaker_heading: BANDIT

speaker_heading: KATE

text: Before he can answer:
speaker_heading: CLEDUS (V.O.)
dialog: (from CB)
dialog: Bandit I. Bandit I. Do you read me?

dialog: up.
speaker_heading: WHAT HE SEES
text: A TRACTOR has moved from behind a tree and is crossing the

text: Bandit tosses the CB mike to Kate with one hand and swerves

speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (to Kate)
dialog: Say this is Bandit I. Then, over.

speaker_heading: BANDIT

speaker_heading: KATE

scene_heading: INSIDE CLAYTON'S CAR - DAY - MOVING

scene_heading: INSIDE BANDIT I - MOVING

speaker_heading: KATE

dialog: (not missing a beat)
dialog: See, I motor-mouth when I get nervous.
dialog: I was nervous when I first got into
dialog: the car. Now I'm scared shitless.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: Believe me, there's nothing to be

speaker_heading: FULL SHOT

speaker_heading: NEW ANGLE
text: as Bandit I hits the dirt road crossing, flies into the air,
text: comes down, smashes into a highway sign and sends it
text: splintering twenty feet into the air. Before he can whip the

text: mailboxes. Whap! Whap! Whap! Whap! Whap!
text: Bandit drops the Cobra into first, zooms past Bandit II and
text: sails back onto the highway.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: Still with me?
text: Kate slowly opens her eyes. She's alive.
scene_heading: ANGLE - SHERIFF CLAYTON'S CAR
text: trapped behind the huge eighteen-wheeler. Clayton pulls out
text: in an attempt to squeeze between Bandit II and the oncoming
dialog: traffic.
text: Brakes squeal, as SEVEN CARS are forced to hit the side
text: shoulder. Just as Clayton moves halfway past the eighteen-
text: wheeler, Cledus puts on the press -- edging Sheriff Clayton
dialog: over.
text: Clayton's rear fender catches on the rig and rips off with a

scene_heading: INSIDE BANDIT II

speaker_heading: BANDIT

speaker_heading: CLEDUS (V.O.)

text: Before he can regain control, Clayton's headed straight for:
scene_heading: AN ABANDONED FRUIT AND VEGETABLE STAND
text: Clayton's car crashes through the stand -- flattening it.
speaker_heading: RUNNING ANGLE

text: but it's closed. The gum falls back in his lap. He looks at
text: it, then pops it back in his mouth again and turns to his
dialog: Deputy.
speaker_heading: BRANFORD
dialog: What the hell you looking at?
text: Before the Deputy can answer, Clayton's voice is back.
speaker_heading: CLAYTON (V.O.)
dialog: (radio)
dialog: This is Sheriff Clayton again. I
text: lost the Cobra, but he's deadheaded
dialog: toward you doing damn near 140. If I
dialog: was you I'd set up a roadblock.
speaker_heading: BRANFORD
dialog: (grabbing mike)
dialog: -- And if I was you, I wouldn't be
dialog: telling me what to do! Now take a
dialog: hike, buster!!!
text: (he angrily hangs up
text: the mike and turns
dialog: to his Deputy)
dialog: Block the road.
scene_heading: HIGHWAY - DAY - HIGH SHOT
text: The two Arkansas Sheriff's cars slow down and form a
dialog: roadblock.
text: Branford and his Deputy climb out of the car. Branford spits
text: out his gum, as two other DEPUTIES climb out of the second
text: car. The four officers move behind their cars. To wait.
speaker_heading: A SPEEDOMETER
dialog: The needle pressing 120. Ease back and we're:
scene_heading: INSIDE BANDIT I - MOVING
text: as Bandit turns to Kate, who's looking out the rear window.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: Well?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: We lost him.
text: Bandit sighs relief, then:
speaker_heading: A VOICE
dialog: (from CB)
dialog: Bandit do you read me?
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (picking up mike)
dialog: This is Bandit, you're coming in
text: long and strong.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: (from CB)
dialog: My handle's Silver Tongued Devil and
dialog: I'm here to tell you, your fellow
dialog: CB'ers are mighty proud of y'all.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: Thanks much, Silver Tongued Devil.
scene_heading: SILVER TONGUED DEVIL
dialog: (from CB)
dialog: But I got a bad Bear story.
text: Bandit and Kate look at each other.
scene_heading: SILVER TONGUED DEVIL
dialog: I just rolled past a county mounty
text: roadblock down on eighty-two.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: Thanks Silver Tongued Devil, we'll
dialog: avoid.
scene_heading: SILVER TONGUED DEVIL
dialog: (from CB)
dialog: Keep the wheels spinning and the
text: beavers grinning.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: Adios.
text: He hangs up the mike.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (referring to Silver
dialog: Tongued Devil)
dialog: Classy guy.
text: Bandit grins and takes a curve at 90. Then they both look
dialog: up.
dialog: WHAT THEY SEE
dialog: The roadblock. No way around it.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: Bandit looks ahead down both sides of the highway. Thinks
dialog: quick.
scene_heading: HIGHWAY - DAY - HIGH SHOT
text: as Bandit I comes roaring down the highway headed directly
text: for the roadblock. A farmhouse is off to the side, about a
text: hundred yards before the roadblock.
speaker_heading: NEW ANGLE
text: Bandit I swerves off the highway, throwing itself into a
text: broadside. The car lurches onto the Farmhouse driveway and
text: barrels across the front yard. It snaps a clothesline full
text: of clothes, sending bras, panties, shirts and socks flying
text: in every direction.
text: It then crashes through a chicken yard and corral fence,
text: sending whatever animals are available -- flying toward
dialog: freedom.
speaker_heading: RACING ANGLE
text: as Bandit I roars across a fruit orchard, weaving in and
text: around rows and rows of trees, finally slamming onto an access
text: road and back onto the highway -- way ahead of the roadblock!
scene_heading: BRANFORD AND HIS MEN
text: stand there like statues with their mouths hanging open. A
text: beat, then all four cops race toward their cars, leap in and
dialog: take off.
scene_heading: INSIDE BANDIT I - MOVING
text: a rattled Kate turns to Bandit. She's about to speak, but
text: sees his intense concentration and says nothing.
scene_heading: THEIR VIEW - THE HIGHWAY
text: up ahead. Coming straight at them, down the center of the
text: road -- another Arkansas Sheriff's car.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: Christ, it looks like a Smokey
dialog: convention.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: Bandit whips the wheel to the right and again, the Cobra is
text: airborne -- flying off the highway, careening down the
text: shoulder, through a creek and up onto another dirt road.
speaker_heading: THE SHERIFF'S CAR
text: spins around in the middle of the highway -- almost flipping
text: over in the process -- straightens out and takes off over
text: the shoulder after Bandit I.
speaker_heading: CAMERA PANS
text: back to the highway. As Sheriff Branford's two Patrol cars
text: come blasting down the highway. They stop at the shoulder. A
text: beat. Then they take off over the shoulder in pursuit.
speaker_heading: CAMERA PANS
text: back again. As Sheriff Clayton's Texas Highway Patrol car
text: skids to a stop.
scene_heading: INSIDE CLAYTON'S CAR
text: Clayton surveys the situation. Bandit I roaring along the
text: dirt road -- the three Arkansas Sheriff cars on his tail. He
text: makes a decision.
speaker_heading: CLAYTON
dialog: (muttering to himself)
dialog: We'll meet again, Bandit.
text: And he floors it taking off down the highway.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: THE DIRT ROAD - MOVING - HIGH SHOT
text: as the three Arkansas Sheriff's cars race after Bandit I.
text: They're on a treacherously narrow road. On both sides -- a
text: long sheer drop -- to water.
scene_heading: INSIDE SHERIFF BRANFORD'S CAR
text: His Deputy is doing at least 80, as he pulls within a few
text: feet of the lead car. The Deputy angrily honks his horn.
speaker_heading: DEPUTY
dialog: I'm gonna pass this fruit!
speaker_heading: BRANFORD
dialog: Just back off the hammer, boy.
speaker_heading: DEPUTY
dialog: But sir, he's gonna get away.
speaker_heading: BRANFORD
dialog: He ain't gonna get nothin' but a
text: brief mention in the obituary column.
text: The Deputy turns to him, not understanding.
speaker_heading: BRANFORD
dialog: (with a smile)
text: The bridge up ahead is out.
scene_heading: HIGH SHOT - THE NARROW DIRT ROAD
text: The four cars kicking up dust for miles.
scene_heading: CREEK - DAY - FULL SHOT
text: where the dirt road ends. But the bridge that once crossed
text: the banks -- is gone.
text: A beat and Bandit I comes roaring straight toward the creek.
scene_heading: INSIDE BANDIT I
text: Bandit and Kate see the creek. No bridge. End of the road.
text: Bandit barely has time to hit the brakes, sending the Cobra
text: into a wild fishtail. Kate desperately braces herself, hanging
text: onto the dashboard.
speaker_heading: FULL SHOT
text: as Bandit wheels the Cobra a full 360° and comes to a halt.
text: He looks back.
scene_heading: HIS VIEW - DOWN THE ROAD
text: a half mile back, the Arkansas Sheriff's are coming on fast.
text: Sirens blasting. The choices are simple. Give up. Or jump
dialog: the creek.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (turning to Kate)
dialog: Listen, we can either give up or...
text: Kate holds the dashboard tighter and closes her eyes.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Just do it.
scene_heading: THE CREEK - DAY
text: Bandit slams the Cobra into first and takes off. Gears grind.
text: Tires screech.
scene_heading: INSIDE BANDIT I
text: The speedometer whizzes past eighty. Bandit holds the wheel
text: tight. Kate takes a breath, then crosses herself.
speaker_heading: RACING ANGLE
text: as Bandit I blasts toward the embankment, hits the dirt
text: incline and suddenly is airborne.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE CREEK
text: Bandit I in mid-air.
speaker_heading: NEW ANGLE
text: as Bandit I sails over camera and comes crashing down on the
dialog: other side. They made it!
scene_heading: INSIDE BANDIT I
text: as Bandit and Kate catch their breath.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: Your honeymoon would've never been
dialog: this exciting.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I don't know. We were planning on
text: seeing the Astrodome.
text: Bandit grins and as they take off:
speaker_heading: CAMERA PANS BACK
text: to the creek. As the first Sheriff's car comes roaring toward
text: the edge doing at least 95. He sees the bridge is out, hits
text: his brakes, goes broadside and flies over the side -- into
dialog: the creek.
text: A beat and Sheriff Branford's car comes wailing down the
text: road. The Deputy slams down his brakes in the nick of time
text: and the car skids halfway over the edge -- hanging suspended
text: in mid-air halfway over the creek.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: as the Third Sheriff's car comes barrelling down the road,
text: spots Branford's car hanging over the edge and brakes. But
text: its rear end slings around, smashing into the rear of
text: Branford's car, sending it flying into the creek. A huge
dialog: splash, then:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INSIDE BANDIT I - MOVING
text: as they roar off the dirt road, back onto the highway, Bandit
text: reaches for the CB mike.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Christ, what channel are we on?...
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Eleven.
text: Bandit looks at Kate as she reaches under the seat for one
text: of her errant cigarettes. Then, he punches in eleven.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: Bandit II. Bandit II. Give me a shout.
scene_heading: INTERCUT - BANDIT I AND II
text: Cledus grabs the mike quickly. Fred has been gnawing on the
text: corner of the front seat.
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: I hope that's you, buddy; 'cause I'd
dialog: hate to start believing in ghosts.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: What does the old Timex say?
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: She's losing minutes so you better
dialog: start running interference or we're
dialog: never gonna make it. Might I remind
dialog: you this was your brainstorm.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: I'll drop off my fare, hit a quick
dialog: choke-and-puke and be blocking for
dialog: you pronto.
text: Kate tries not to react to this.
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: Bandit?
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: Yeah, guy?
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: (into mike)
text: Pick up a burger for Fred. He's going
dialog: crazy.
dialog: (slaps Fred on the
dialog: butt)
text: Bandit puts the mike back and turns to Kate. Feels he should
text: say something. Before he can:
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You heard the man. Step on it.
text: Bandit studies her for a moment, then stomps on it.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: A TRUCK STOP CAFE - A FEW MINUTES LATER
text: Bandit I pulls in between a row of eighteen-wheelers parked
text: in front of the cafe. A few Truckers, bragging about their
text: rigs, check out Bandit and Kate. They're especially taken
text: with Kate's wedding gown. She and Bandit are oblivious to
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (turns to Kate)
dialog: The bus'll pick you up over there.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Uh... you got enough bread for a
dialog: ticket?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Enough to get to Jersey. I'll walk
dialog: the rest of the way. I've been sitting
dialog: a long time.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Nice meeting you. It's been a trip.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (it was nothing)
dialog: Hey...
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Enjoy your Kenworth.
text: She offers her hand and they shake. Then, Bandit heads toward
text: the truck stop and Kate to the bus stop. He turns and looks
text: back. She doesn't.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: INSIDE THE TRUCK STOP
text: about fifteen Truckers inside. Buck Owens playing on the
text: juke box. Pinball machines going strong.
text: Bandit walks in and crosses to the counter. A hot-looking
text: WAITRESS with ratted hair and painted face stands in front
text: of a blackboard where the menu of the day is written. She
text: straightens herself and crosses to Bandit.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: (coming on)
dialog: What's your pleasure?
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: Couple of cheeseburgers, no
dialog: condiments...
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: No what?
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: Nothing on 'em and two cups of mud;
dialog: one while I'm waiting.
text: Bandit crosses to a booth, as a couple of TRUCKERS enter and
text: join another TRUCKER sitting in the booth next to Bandit.
speaker_heading: TRUCKER #1
dialog: Jesus, Richmond; you look like
dialog: squirrel shit.
speaker_heading: TRUCKER #2
dialog: You wanna drive fourteen hundred
dialog: miles for these cheap bastards? I
dialog: feel like leaving my rig in the middle
dialog: of the highway and tellin' them to
dialog: kiss my antenna.
speaker_heading: TRUCKER #1
dialog: I know what you mean, good buddy.
text: The Waitress comes over with Bandit's coffee. He pours in a
text: ton of sugar and stirs. As he takes a sip, he hears:
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Hi.
text: Bandit whips around.
speaker_heading: WHAT HE SEES
text: Kate. Standing in front of him -- sans wedding dress. She's
text: now wearing tight jeans and a denim shirt with the bottom
text: rolled up and knotted above her midriff. She looks foxier
dialog: than ever.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (with a southern drawl)
dialog: The bus ain't passin' through these
dialog: here parts for a piece.
dialog: (sliding into booth)
dialog: I know. You only have a second.
speaker_heading: CLOSER ANGLE
text: as they sit across from each other.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: They wouldn't take Master Charge so
dialog: I traded in my gown.
text: The Waitress comes by.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: (snippy; to Kate)
dialog: Coffee?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Please.
text: Bandit watches as she takes a sip.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Jesus!!!
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: Trucker coffee. It's three times
text: stronger. Good for a hundred miles.
dialog: That, a coupla perks, and you can
text: leap tall buildings in a single bound.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: (calling O.S.)
dialog: Order up!
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: That's me.
text: He gulps down a half a cup of coffee and rises.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: See ya, Kate.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Ciao.
text: TRACK WITH BANDIT
text: moving quickly to the counter to pick up his order. Behind
text: him; we notice one of the Truckers from the next booth gets
text: up and crosses to Kate.
text: Bandit reaches in his pocket to pay for the order:
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: (seductive)
dialog: Sure I can't interest you in anything
dialog: else?
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Another time.
text: Bandit picks up his order and turns toward the door. He sees
text: the Trucker talking to Kate. The Trucker's buddies have turned
text: around in their booth and are all over her.
text: Bandit sets the food down on the counter and crosses to the
dialog: booth.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (to Truckers)
dialog: -- Believe me, fellas; I'd love to
dialog: schmoos, but...
speaker_heading: TRUCKER #1
dialog: Don't be so conceited. You don't
dialog: even know us.
speaker_heading: TRUCKER #2
dialog: (an ugly dude)
dialog: To know us, is to love us.
text: Bandit steps between them.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: Hey, how y'all doin'?
speaker_heading: TRUCKER #2
dialog: Who wants to know?
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: Listen, guys; I'm in a rush. Otherwise
dialog: I'd arrange it so they had to carry
dialog: you outta here in doggie bags.
speaker_heading: TRUCKER #1
dialog: You and what goddamn army?
text: The Truckers all turn to Bandit, ready to mop the floor with
text: him. The restaurant is silent, except for Willie Nelson, now
text: singing on the juke box. Every eye is on them. A brawl looks
dialog: inevitable.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (worried)
dialog: Bandit, please...
speaker_heading: TRUCKER #2
dialog: (totally surprised,
dialog: almost yelling)
dialog: Bandit?!? You're the Bandit? The
dialog: fella been runnin' the blue troopers
dialog: ragged?
text: Bandit looks around self-consciously. Nods.
speaker_heading: TRUCKER #2
dialog: Lemme shake your hand, boy! You're
dialog: my new goddamn idol.
speaker_heading: TRUCKER #1
dialog: (slapping Bandit on
dialog: the back)
dialog: You're the rage of CB land. We been
dialog: followin' you for hours.
speaker_heading: TRUCKER #2
dialog: If we'da known you was the Bandit,
dialog: we wouldn't a never lipped off to
dialog: your old lady.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: Well, she's not exactly my...
speaker_heading: TRUCKER #3
dialog: (jumping in)
dialog: Lemme have your autograph, hoss!
text: Everyone in the restaurant crowds around Bandit and he starts
text: hurriedly signing autographs.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I've done twenty-eight Broadway shows
dialog: and no one's ever asked me for an
dialog: autograph.
dialog: Then:
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (to the group, starting
dialog: off)
dialog: Listen, guys, I gotta cover ground.
dialog: I'm due in Atlanta in less than ten
dialog: hours.
speaker_heading: TRUCKER #1
dialog: Good luck.
speaker_heading: TRUCKER #2
dialog: Give our best to Jimmy Carter.
text: Kate slips out of the booth, as Bandit crosses back to the
dialog: counter.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - COUNTER
text: Bandit grabs his order and finds the OWNER facing him --
text: holding out Bandit's money.
speaker_heading: OWNER
text: It's on the house.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (grins)
dialog: Thanks.
text: He turns to leave.
speaker_heading: OWNER
dialog: Son...
text: Bandit turns back.
speaker_heading: OWNER
dialog: Godspeed.
text: Bandit smiles. Then starts out. He notices Kate is gone.
text: Shrugs. Heads out the door.
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE TRUCK STOP - DAY
text: Bandit bolts out in time to see his Cobra pulling out, about
text: to take off.
speaker_heading: NEW ANGLE
text: as Bandit leaps off the steps and races toward the car, just
text: as it peels out. He swings the passenger door open and is
text: half in -- half out, as the Cobra skids out the truck stop,
text: over the curb and onto the highway. The door's still wide
text: open. Bandit hanging on.
scene_heading: INSIDE BANDIT I
text: Kate's behind the wheel. She tromps on it and the car takes
text: off like greased lightening. Bandit's struggling to stay in
dialog: the car.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (hanging on)
dialog: What the hell are you doing?!?
speaker_heading: KATE
text: (gestures over her
dialog: shoulder)
dialog: He's after us again!
text: Kate whips around a corner almost throwing Bandit onto the
text: pavement. He grabs her arm and manages to pull himself into
text: the car and slam the door. He looks back.
scene_heading: HIS VIEW - THRU REAR WINDOW
text: Sheriff Clayton's Texas Highway Patrol car is after them
text: again. Siren blasting.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: Bandit turns to Kate.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: You know this guy, don't you?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (driving hard, eyes
dialog: on the road)
dialog: I've never seen him before in my
dialog: life. I'm just trying to help you
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: By stealing my car?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I would've come back for you.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (not believing)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: KATE
text: (turning to him, dead
dialog: serious)
dialog: Yeah.
text: She wraps a corner doing 60, hits the highway and puts it to
text: the floor. Clayton's battered up car is still coming on
text: strong.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE CLAYTON'S CAR - MOVING
text: Sheriff Clayton's eyes are glazed as he tears after Bandit
dialog: I.
speaker_heading: CLAYTON
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: I'm gonna get you, you dirty,
text: stinking, rotten sumbitch.
text: BACK TO BANDIT
text: Kate at the wheel.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Look, the truth is, I didn't want to
dialog: be dumped at the truck stop. I wanted
dialog: to go on with you. I needed an excuse.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: You could've asked.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You might have said no. I have trouble
dialog: handling rejection.
scene_heading: THE HIGHWAY
text: Bandit I streaks past, Kate driving. A beat and a big rig,
text: hauling a crane comes out of a side road. The truck moves
text: slowly down the highway -- a wide load.
scene_heading: SHERIFF CLAYTON'S CAR
text: roaring up.
speaker_heading: INSIDE THE CAR
text: Clayton floors it and hunches low over the wheel as he passes
text: the truck -- afraid the crane's going to take off his head.
speaker_heading: FULL SHOT
text: as Sheriff Clayton's car zooms under the crane, clearing it
text: by a hair. But the crane rips off Clayton's lights and siren.
text: Leaving only wires and a gaping hole in the roof of the car.
scene_heading: ARKANSAS HIGHWAY - DAY
text: Bandit I streaking. Kate takes a dangerous curve doing 85.
text: Bandit gasps, but Kate holds her own.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: Where did you learn how to drive
dialog: like this?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Like what?
text: He smiles.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: My first father was a redneck. He
dialog: taught me how to drive fast and pants
dialog: people.
text: Bandit picks up the CB mike, flicking the crystal selector
text: two stops.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: Breaker, this is Bandit I, how are
dialog: your vocal cords?
scene_heading: INTERCUT - BANDIT I AND II
text: Cledus takes his mike. Fred is on all fours in the now chewed-
text: up front seat. Bouncing around.
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: My vocal cords are fine, but Fred's
text: ain't. He's been barking, eating the
dialog: seats and driving me crackers.
dialog: (Fred barks)
dialog: Hear that? Where's his chow?
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: On its way. Give me a coupla minutes,
dialog: okay?
speaker_heading: CLEDUS

dialog: Do I have a choice?
speaker_heading: BANDIT

speaker_heading: CLEDUS' VIEW

speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: I just passed two Kojacks with a
dialog: Kodak.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Man, this highway's crawling with
dialog: Bears. Ain't no way we gonna make
dialog: Atlanta on time without you runnin'
dialog: blocker.
text: Bandit looks back over his shoulder. Then:
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: I'm still trying to ditch this Texas
dialog: Smokey. I don't know what the sucker
dialog: wants.
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: What they all want -- to handcuff a
dialog: hero.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: As far as John Law knows, I'm just a
dialog: joy ridin' Georgia redneck. We keep
dialog: 'em outta your backyard, we're cool.
dialog: (looking back again)
dialog: Now just give me five to ditch this
dialog: idiot and I'll meet you in Ole Miss.
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: If you don't, we can kiss that

scene_heading: HIS VIEW - THROUGH REAR VIEW MIRROR
text: Sheriff Clayton -- gaining ground.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: They're speeding around curves now, Kate doing her best to
text: control the Cobra. She takes a corner too fast and too wide.
text: Bandit I drifts into the oncoming lane and suddenly they're
dialog: staring at:
speaker_heading: A CAMPER
text: coming straight at them. A Mother, Father and Two Children
text: all riding in the front seat.
speaker_heading: FULL SHOT
text: Kate swerves back into her lane, avoiding a head-on by less
text: than a split second.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: I think we should switch seats.
text: He puts his hands on the steering wheel and his foot on the
text: accelerator, but he and Kate get tangled up trying to make
dialog: the switch.
text: The car goes out of control -- smashes into a guard railing
text: and bounces back onto the highway.
text: They try to switch again. Impossible.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (fastening seat belt)
dialog: You go ahead. This seat's more
dialog: comfortable.
scene_heading: THE HIGHWAY - DAY - HIGH SHOT
text: Bandit I streaking, followed in the distance by the Texas
text: Highway Patrol car.
text: Coming down the highway, from the opposite direction -- is a

text: Suddenly, Bandit I swerves to the right and starts across
dialog: the highway.
speaker_heading: BANDIT (V.O.)
dialog: Mississippi's the other way!
speaker_heading: KATE (V.O.)
dialog: You want to lose this putz or not?!?
text: With that, Bandit I zips between two limos heading the Funeral
text: Procession, crosses the highway, sails over the embankment
text: and swerves onto a bumpy dirt path.
speaker_heading: CAMERA WHIPS BACK
text: to Sheriff Clayton's car -- roaring straight at us.
scene_heading: INSIDE CLAYTON'S CAR

scene_heading: THE HIGHWAY - DAY

speaker_heading: KATE

dialog: every two seconds...
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: Yeah, it's tough when your cheek-
dialog: bones are your main asset.
speaker_heading: KATE
text: (nods, then sees
dialog: something O.S.)

speaker_heading: WHAT SHE SEES

speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: I think you'd better let me...
text: Before Bandit can finish, Kate trounces on it, driving
text: straight toward the fence.
speaker_heading: RACING ANGLE
text: as Bandit I blasts toward the incline, hits it doing 70 and
text: sails over the fence.
text: THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FENCE
text: we HEAR the CRACK of a baseball bat and a CENTER FIELDER, in
text: full uniform, takes off after a long fly ball. He stops in
text: his tracks at what he sees.
speaker_heading: REVERSE ANGLE
text: as Bandit I flies over the fence and lands in the middle of
text: a MINOR LEAGUE BASEBALL GAME.
text: The Center Fielder is absolutely flabbergasted, as Kate
text: straightens out the Shelby Cobra and takes off across the
text: baseball field.
text: She roars over second base and does a 360° fishtail in the
text: middle of the pitchers mound. PLAYERS scatter in every
dialog: direction.
scene_heading: NEW ANGLE - MOVING
text: as Kate speeds past the dugout and a CHEERING CROWD, back to
text: an access road.
text: Up ahead. The highway. And safety.
scene_heading: INSIDE BANDIT I
text: Kate looks over to Bandit, a huge grin on her face.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Baseball needs a little pizzazz.
text: BACK ON THE HIGHWAY
text: The Funeral Procession finally passes and Clayton zooms across
text: the highway and onto the bumpy dirt path.
text: BACK ON THE DIRT PATH
text: Sheriff Clayton's car comes to a sliding halt in front of
text: the fence. He looks around for some sign of Bandit I. Nothing.
dialog: They've vanished.
speaker_heading: CLAYTON
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: This is beginning to piss me off.
text: The path is far too narrow to turn around, so as he begins
text: the arduous chore of driving in reverse down the long narrow
text: path, knocking off his remaining hub caps on the way, we:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: HIGHWAY SIGN
text: reading Welcome to Mississippi. A black streak whizzes past.
scene_heading: INSIDE BANDIT I - MOVING
text: Kate still at the wheel. Bandit on the CB.

scene_heading: HIS VIEW - THROUGH SIDEVIEW MIRROR
text: Bandit I coming up to his back door.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: as Cledus signals with his arm and pulls the, rig off to the
text: side of the road.
text: The door opens and Cledus climbs down the metal steps of the
text: truck, followed by Fred. They both take a long, healthy
text: stretch, as Bandit I pulls to a stop behind them.
speaker_heading: NEW ANGLE
text: Bandit and Kate get out of the Cobra. Cledus is surprised to
text: see her. She immediately crosses to him and offers her hand.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I'm Kate. You must be Cledus.
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: (shaking hands,
dialog: awkwardly)
dialog: Yes, ma'am.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: How's your twenty?
text: Cledus doesn't get it. Bandit laughs, unwraps the hamburger.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: Here you go, pal.
text: He holds the hamburger out for the dog, who wolfs it down in
text: one bite, then goes off to relieve himself.
text: Cledus takes Bandit by the arm and pulls him aside.
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: I thought you were dumping the chick
text: at the truck stop.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: I ran into complications.
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: I hate to say it...
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: Then don't.
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: (rolling on)
dialog: -- But everytime we've ever messed
dialog: up, it's because your rhyme's over-
dialog: ruling your reason. I know you think
dialog: you're God's gift to waitresses,
dialog: but...
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (interupts)
dialog: Just don't worry about it.
dialog: (then)
dialog: How we doin' timewise?
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: Not good enough to be standing here
text: shooting the bull.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (turns to leave)
dialog: We're gone.
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: Bandit?
text: Bandit turns to him.
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: (referring to Kate)
dialog: Nice ass.
text: Bandit grins, moves to the car.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (whistles to Kate)
dialog: Let's hit it.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (crossing to Bandit I)
dialog: Nice meeting you, Cledus. Keep on
dialog: truckin'.
text: Cledus smiles, as Bandit and Kate climb into the Cobra. Bandit
text: starts the engine and they're off.
text: Cledus pulls a crowbar out of the rig and begins hitting all
text: his tires. Checking them out. As he does this:
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: (calling)
dialog: Let's roll, Fred.
text: Cledus finishes the tires, but Fred isn't moving.
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: C'mon, Fred.
text: Nothing. The dog stares at him. Cledus takes a step forward.
text: Fred takes a step backward. Cledus takes two steps forward.
text: And Fred takes off. Running through the woods.
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: (running after him)
dialog: Fred!!!!!!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INSIDE BANDIT I
text: rolling. They're silent for a long time. Then:
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You plan on driving trucks all your
dialog: life?
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: No, actually I was thinking of
dialog: becoming a brain surgeon.
dialog: She laughs, as we:
scene_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: CLEDUS CHASING FRED
text: through the woods. As he's about to nab him, the Dog cuts
text: right and Cledus sprawls left.
scene_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: INSIDE BANDIT I
text: Kate and Bandit. Talking. More relaxed.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: -- Trucking ain't the easiest life
dialog: in the world. I mean, you can't make
dialog: it much past fifty and you sure as
dialog: shit don't get a gold watch when you
dialog: hang it all up. But I like keeping
dialog: on the move. You know?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Do I know? I'm an authority on it.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: I guess if there's one lesson I've
dialog: learned, it's that even misery has a
text: tough time hitting a moving target.
dialog: (then, realizing)
dialog: I forgot your question?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You plan on driving trucks all your
dialog: life?
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: I... uh... I don't know. I guess
dialog: don't like to think about it.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Then let's change the subject.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: What do you think about forced school
dialog: busing?
dialog: And:
scene_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: CLEDUS RACING AFTER FRED
text: gaining ground. A flying tackle. And he snares him. Cledus
text: is out of breath and pissed. Fred licks his face.
scene_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: INSIDE BANDIT I
text: Bandit spots a green sedan with a radio-mike antenna coming
text: in the other direction. He backs off the accelerator.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Your foot fall asleep?
text: Bandit shakes his head, reaching for the CB.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (into mike)
text: Bandit two, Smokey in a plain brown
dialog: wrapper coming your way. Over.
text: No answer from Cledus. Kate has no idea what Bandit's just

speaker_heading: BANDIT

text: An unmarked police car.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: I know.

dialog: Bandit two, bring yourself on in.
text: Still no answer.
speaker_heading: BANDIT

dialog: Bandit two, do you copy?
scene_heading: INTERCUT - BANDIT I AND II
text: Cledus, exhausted and sweaty, tosses Fred into the eighteen-
text: wheeler and lunges for the CB mike.
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: Yeah, yeah, yeah? What's up?
text: Bandit glances up in the rear view mirror, sees the Smokey
text: in a plain wrapper take an off ramp. Harmless.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: Never mind. It's nothing.
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: Anything else you don't want me to
dialog: know?
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: Nope. Just keep those wheels churning.
text: Cledus hangs up the mike, starts his rig, checks for oncoming

scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: THE HIGHWAY - DAY - AERIAL SHOT
text: Bandit I and Bandit II whizzing down the highway. Picking up

scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INSIDE BANDIT I - LATER
text: Bandit notices a broken-down FORD with its hood up, parked

text: opens the glove compartment, takes out two screwdrivers and
text: hands one to Kate. She stops singing.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (explaining)
dialog: I'm sure the Arkansas Bears put out

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (opening door)
dialog: You take the front, I'll take the

scene_heading: QUICK CUT TO:
scene_heading: A MISSISSIPPI LICENSE PLATE

scene_heading: DISSOLVE THRU TO:

speaker_heading: BANDIT (V.O.)
dialog: Bandit two, I gotta make a quick pit

speaker_heading: CLEDUS (V.O.)
dialog: Now what?
speaker_heading: BANDIT (V.O.)
dialog: We're outta motion lotion.
speaker_heading: CLEDUS (V.O.)
dialog: I'll keep streaking. Pick me up.
text: Bandit I takes an off ramp, as Bandit II continues sailing
text: down the highway.
scene_heading: UNION 76 STATION
text: off the main highway. Bandit I pulls up to one of several
text: islands in the large station. Trucks are gassing up at various
dialog: pumps.
speaker_heading: BANDIT I
text: Kate climbs out.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Save my seat.
text: She starts toward the Ladies Room as a young BLACK ATTENDANT
text: struts up to Bandit I.
speaker_heading: ATTENDANT
dialog: Say, Cobra: what's your pleasure?
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: Fill it.
speaker_heading: ATTENDANT
dialog: Check the hood, my man?
text: Bandit shakes his head "no."
speaker_heading: ATTENDANT
dialog: Aw right. This is a clean machine.
dialog: Yeah, I was thinking 'bout getting
dialog: me one of these myself. But I figure
dialog: I'm conspicuous enough to the police
dialog: as it is, so why encourage them more,
dialog: if you know what I mean.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: Yeah, I know what you mean.
text: The Attendant starts pumping Supreme. Bandit leans back in
text: the seat. Closes his eyes.
text: Suddenly, from his CB.
speaker_heading: A VOICE
dialog: (over CB)
dialog: Bandit, do you read me? Over.
text: Bandit snaps his eyes open. Who the hell is this? He grabs

speaker_heading: BANDIT

scene_heading: INTERCUT - SHERIFF CLAYTON - TIGHT

speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: Not that I don't have any respect
dialog: for the law, but what's your problem,
dialog: man?
speaker_heading: CLAYTON
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: You.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: Yeah, well I kinda figured that.
speaker_heading: CLAYTON

dialog: breathing down your neck.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: Well, if your breath is as sweet as
dialog: your personality, I got a lot to
dialog: look forward to. Adios.
text: Bandit hangs up the mike, as Kate comes back sipping an orange

speaker_heading: NEW ANGLE

speaker_heading: ATTENDANT
dialog: (to Bandit)
dialog: That'll be eight-seventy two.

speaker_heading: ATTENDANT
dialog: -- Outta ten.
text: Camera has now PULLED BACK enough to see:
scene_heading: SHERIFF CLAYTON'S CAR
text: parked on the other side of the gas station. The car's front

text: Clayton sits in the battered Sheriff's car, having no idea
text: Bandit I is in the very same station.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE GAS STATION

speaker_heading: ATTENDANT

speaker_heading: RUNNING ANGLE

scene_heading: CLOSE - CLAYTON
text: His head whips around, when he sees Bandit I roar out of the

text: BACK TO SCENE
text: Clayton starts his engine and stomps on it... totally
text: forgetting his front end is up on jacks. Clayton's car takes
text: off on its rear wheels, sails halfway across the gas station,
text: and slams head-on into a BRAND NEW CONTINENTAL.
text: As the Continental sails across the islands:
scene_heading: CLOSE - ON CLAYTON
text: Watching in horror. Then, trying to compose himself.
speaker_heading: CLAYTON
dialog: (muttering to himself)
dialog: It's all right. It's not your car.

speaker_heading: VOICE

speaker_heading: BANDIT (V.O.)
dialog: What's up, Dixie Chicken?
speaker_heading: KATE (V.O.)

speaker_heading: DIXIE CHICKEN (V.O.)
dialog: Been hearin' all 'bout y'all and
dialog: wanted to let y'all know, y'all got

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: ANOTHER SECTION OF THE MISSISSIPPI HIGHWAY - DAY

scene_heading: THE THIRD HIGHWAY PATROL CAR

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: INSIDE THE TRUCK STOP
text: Cledus is talking on the phone, Fred waiting nearby. A BIKER
text: waits to use the phone.
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Hey, pumpkin pie, how you doin'? I
dialog: should be home real soon. Yeah, Fred's
dialog: fine. Still po'ed? See, time heals
dialog: all wounds. Anyway, just wanted to
dialog: check in. Okay, sweetie. You too.
dialog: Bye-bye.
text: Cledus hangs up.
speaker_heading: BIKER
dialog: Hey, man; this your goddam mutt?
text: Cledus nods.
speaker_heading: BIKER
dialog: He just bit me.
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: Fred? C'mon, man; he don't bite.
text: Cledus begins walking back toward the counter.
speaker_heading: BIKER
dialog: I said the mother bit me.
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: He couldn'ta bit you. He's got better
dialog: taste than that.
text: Laughter O.S. Suddenly, the Biker tries kicking Fred. Fred
text: leaps back. Baring his teeth. Scared.
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: Hey, back off, huh!?!
speaker_heading: BIKER
dialog: Animals like this should be put to
dialog: sleep.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER BIKER
dialog: Yeah, let's put the poor little
text: sumbitch outta his misery.
text: The other bikers chime in their approval, as the First Biker
text: takes a pool cue off the wall rack and starts toward Fred.
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: (angry)
dialog: Hey, pal; I told you. Cut that shit
dialog: out.
text: But the Biker isn't listening. He starts to swing the cue at
text: Fred, but Cledus whirls and slams his fist into the Biker's
text: pock-marked face blowing him into the jukebox. The record
text: skips and jumps to Merle Haggard's "live version" of "Okie
dialog: From Muskogee." Loud.
text: Instantly, the other bikers are on their feet. A TRUCKER
text: stands to help Cledus and is immediately cold-cocked.
scene_heading: MOVING ANGLE - HAND HELD
text: Cledus sees he's in the middle of a powder keg -- with no
text: way out. He backs up toward the pool table, grabs a cue.
speaker_heading: OWNER
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: Hey, c'mon fellas...
text: Cledus swings the pool cue. The bikers split up. Move around
text: him. He can't watch them all. Then like clockwork, they all
text: rush him. Three from the front, two from the side, one over
text: the top of the pool table.
text: Cledus nails one of them with a pool cue to the nuts. The
text: Biker screams and doubles over. A Biker flies over the pool
text: table and crashes into Cledus from behind -- knocking the
text: pool cue away. Another Biker rushes in, but gets Cledus'
text: Frye Boot in the gut for his trouble.
text: But then the other two nail Cledus from each side and it's
text: over. They've got him. Cledus tries to shake himself loose,
text: but the First Biker, picks himself up from the jukebox,
text: strolls over and lets him have it twice in the groin. Cledus
text: doubles over. Onto the ground.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: as the three bikers pick Cledus up and toss him into the
text: air, over to the other three bikers. They catch him and toss
text: him back again.
text: A beat, then they run toward the window, still carrying
text: Cledus. They swing him back and forth. One. Two. Three. Then,
text: they toss him out the window.
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE TRUCK STOP - DAY
text: Glass shatters, as Cledus comes flying through the window,
text: landing face down in the gravel. With a thud. Wait. And Fred
text: is tossed out after him.
speaker_heading: CLOSER ANGLE
text: Cledus slowly pulls himself up, trying to hold back his anger
text: and humiliation. He begins walking. Fred follows. Camera
dialog: stays:
scene_heading: CLOSE - ON CLEDUS - TRACKING
text: as he starts toward Bandit II. He passes something off-screen.
text: The trace of a smile crosses his face. He keeps walking.
dialog: From O.S.
speaker_heading: ATTENDANT (O.S.)
dialog: That's seventy-three eighty-four.
text: We stay CLOSE on Cledus, as he reaches into his pocket and
text: hands the Attendant some bills off-camera. Doesn't break
text: stride. We're still close. Tracking.
text: A few more steps and a bag ENTERS FRAME. Cledus takes it.
speaker_heading: OWNER (O.S.)
dialog: Pay me next time through, son.
text: Cledus nods, takes the bag. Keeps walking. Up to the truck.
text: Climbing the steps.
scene_heading: ANGLE - THRU WINDSHIELD - TIGHT
text: Cledus settles into the truck.
text: Fred climbs over him, into the shotgun position. HOLD on
text: Cledus, as he fires up the big eighteen-wheeler. He glances
text: again at something off-screen. And his smile becomes a little
dialog: wider.
scene_heading: ANGLE - THE GEARSHIFT
text: Cledus' gloved hand jams the big rig into gear. The truck
text: leaps forward. And now:
speaker_heading: FULL SHOT
text: of the eighteen-wheeler, as it roars toward the long line of
text: Chromed Choppers -- knocking them to the ground and rolling
dialog: right over them. Crunch!!!!
speaker_heading: NEW ANGLE

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (more relaxed)

dialog: (a beat)
dialog: We were together for almost a year.
dialog: I thought he was it.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: And?
speaker_heading: KATE

speaker_heading: KATE

scene_heading: BANDIT I - MOVING

text: Bandit floors it, roars along the shoulder and around the
speaker_heading: VW.

scene_heading: INSIDE BANDIT
text: Bandit flicks the CB selector over two channels.
speaker_heading: BANDIT

scene_heading: HIGHWAY - DAY
text: Bandit II racing down the oncoming lane looking for an

speaker_heading: NEW ANGLE

speaker_heading: CLAYTON

scene_heading: THE HIGHWAY - HIGH SHOT - AFTERNOON

dialog: Charles-Alan-Richard -- two-seven-
text: three. Vehicle eastbound on Interstate
dialog: seventy-two. Request assistance.
scene_heading: HIGHWAY - HIGH SHOT - LATE AFTERNOON
text: The Two Georgia Highway Patrol cars race past Bandit II.
text: Cledus gives them a small wave. They don't notice.
scene_heading: BANDIT I - MOVING - LATE AFTERNOON
text: as the Cobra comes racing up to the rear of a long line of
text: slowmoving traffic. Bandit moves out to pass and sees:
speaker_heading: PICKUP TRUCK
text: coming straight at him.
speaker_heading: BANDIT I
text: swerves onto the shoulder.
scene_heading: THE PICKUP TRUCK
dialog: does the same.
scene_heading: BANDIT I AND THE PICKUP TRUCK
text: Bandit I swerves back onto the highway. So does the Pickup.
text: And it looks like a head-on for sure.
text: At the last instant, Bandit swerves back onto the shoulder.
text: The Pickup rips past him and Bandit manages to pull the Cobra
text: back onto the highway and into the free lane.
speaker_heading: NEW ANGLE
text: as the Pickup Truck now is face-to-face with the First Georgia
text: Highway Patrol car. They jockey for position. The First
text: Highway Patrol car swerves and passes the Pickup, but the
text: Second one hits the shoulder barely avoiding a head-on.
scene_heading: ANGLE - THE SECOND HIGHWAY PATROL CAR
text: as it flies over the ditch and does a complete midair end-
text: over-end flip -- landing in a ditch. Out of the chase.
scene_heading: THE EXPRESSWAY OVERPASS - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Bandit I races toward the overpass, the Georgia Highway Patrol
text: car three hundred yards behind.
text: Bandit I takes the hairpin turn full out and goes into a
text: four wheel drift. Bandit manages to maintain control and
text: punches it in mid-slide, blasting the Cobra through the turn,
text: onto the Expressway below.
speaker_heading: CAMERA HOLDS
text: as the Highway Patrol car tries the same feat, loses control
text: and crashes into the chain link divider.
scene_heading: THE EXPRESSWAY - FROM ABOVE
text: Bandit roars onto the Expressway, sailing right past A GEORGIA
text: STATE TROOPER'S CAR, parked on the shoulder, waiting for
dialog: speeders.
text: The State Trooper fires up his engine and with red lights
text: twirling and siren wailing, pulls out after Bandit I.
text: Just as he does, the Georgia Highway Patrol car comes racing
text: by and they slam into each other -- knocking both cars twenty
text: feet each way.
text: Both cars straighten out and wait for the other to take the
text: lead. The Trooper starts off. So does the Highway Patrol
text: car. The Trooper stops, so does the Highway Patrol car. This
text: goes on for several beats until they both start off at the
text: same time -- and smash right into each other again.
scene_heading: HIGH SHOT - THE EXPRESSWAY
text: as Bandit I races down the Expressway, the Two Police cars
text: finally get it together and take off after him.
scene_heading: INSIDE BANDIT
text: Bandit weaves in and out of traffic. Glances out his side
dialog: mirror.
scene_heading: ANGLE - THROUGH SIDE MIRROR
text: The Georgia Highway Patrol car and the Georgia State Trooper
text: racing down the Expressway, cars pulling onto the shoulder
dialog: so they can pass.
scene_heading: ANGLE - EXPRESSWAY ON RAMP
text: A large red sign reads: WRONG WAY - DO NOT ENTER. Bandit I
text: blasts by the sign and enters the on ramp. Going the wrong
dialog: way!
scene_heading: INSIDE BANDIT
text: Bandit hugging the shoulder. Kate hugging the seat. Petrified.
speaker_heading: THEIR VIEW
text: ANOTHER HIGHWAY PATROL CAR is coming down the ramp -- headed
dialog: straight for them.
speaker_heading: FULL SHOT
text: The Highway Patrol car isn't giving ground, as Bandit I roars
text: toward him.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Oh, dear God in heaven!
speaker_heading: THE TWO CARS
text: racing toward each other. Neither giving ground. A dead-on
dialog: Chickie Run.
text: Finally, at the last possible instant, the Highway Patrol
text: car swerves to the right, crashing through the guard railing
dialog: and sailing into:
speaker_heading: MIDAIR
text: The Highway Patrol car flies through the air and crashes
text: down on the back of a moving FLATBED TRACTOR TRAILER.
text: The Flatbed Truck just keeps driving. Not even noticing.
scene_heading: THE EXPRESSWAY - RACING ANGLE - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Bandit I, still going the wrong way. Up ahead -- an Expressway
text: full of cars -- headed straight for Bandit I.
text: Bandit floorboards it, flies over the center divider and
text: ends up on the other side of the Expressway, just ahead of
dialog: Bandit II.
scene_heading: INSIDE BANDIT I - MOVING - LATE AFTERNOON
text: as they race down the Expressway, flying past another
text: billboard announcing: The Peach Tree Classic.
text: Bandit wipes his brow.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: What'll we do for excitement on our
dialog: second date?
text: Before she can answer, from the CB:
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: (over CB)
dialog: Bandit I, let me offer my heartiest
text: congratulations and a piece of advice.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: What's that, pardner?
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: (over CB)
dialog: Don't take that foot off the hammer,
dialog: 'cause you got wall-to-wall Bears
dialog: about to pour over you like maple
dialog: syrup.
text: Bandit looks up in his rear view mirror.
speaker_heading: WHAT HE SEES
text: Behind him, FIVE NEW GEORGIA HIGHWAY PATROL CARS, coming on
text: strong.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE EXPRESSWAY
text: as the Five Highway Patrol cars hit their sirens and wail
text: past Bandit II, on their way after Bandit I.
text: Bandit I quickly veers off the Expressway onto a crossing
text: highway. The Police cars all follow.
text: And Bandit II, continues whipping down the Expressway. Atlanta
dialog: bound.
scene_heading: INSIDE BANDIT I - MOVING
text: as he flips the CB channel over to 19.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (to Kate)
dialog: I think it's time to call a mayday.
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: Breaker. Breaker. This is Bandit to
dialog: Hot Pants. Come back.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: HOT PANTS
dialog: (over CB)
dialog: Why should I?
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: Because I need your help, sweet thing.
dialog: (glancing back, the
dialog: five Smokeys gaining
dialog: ground)
dialog: And I need it bad.
scene_heading: INTERCUT - A DRIVE-IN RESTAURANT
text: A teenage hangout. Really hopping. Country and Western MUSIC
text: blaring from the radios of Pickup Trucks, VW Vans, Sports
text: Cars, etc, all parked in front of the restaurant. Almost
text: every vehicle sports a CB antenna.
text: CAMERA FINDS a beautiful WAITRESS, holding a CB mike,
text: stretched out of a Customized MODEL A. Inside the Model A,
text: the Driver is eating a hamburger. The beautiful Waitress is
text: HOT PANTS.
speaker_heading: HOT PANTS
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: I'm working, Bandit. Besides, what's
dialog: the matter? Won't your new girl friend
dialog: help you?
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: Hot Pants, please. I'm gonna be flying
dialog: by in about five minutes with Smokey
dialog: on my tail. Can you lock it off behind
dialog: me?
dialog: No answer.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: What do you want me to do, Hot Pants?
dialog: Beg?
speaker_heading: HOT PANTS
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: I'm begging.
speaker_heading: HOT PANTS
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: I want you to know I'm doing this
dialog: against my better instincts.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: But you'll do it?
speaker_heading: HOT PANTS
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: I'll do it.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: I owe you a big one, Hot Pants.
speaker_heading: HOT PANTS
dialog: (into mike, sexily)
dialog: You sure do.
text: Bandit hangs up the mike and turns to Kate.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (before she can say
dialog: anything)
dialog: Yes, I actually dated a woman who
text: still wears hot pants.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: THE EXPRESSWAY - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Bandit I whizzes past camera. Wait. Then here comes the
text: Highway Patrol. They've picked up reinforcements. Ten in
dialog: all.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: THE HIGHWAY - IN FRONT OF THE DRIVE-IN - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Hot Pants has gathered all the cars from the drive-in and
text: lined them up along both shoulders of the highway. Some are
text: facing east. Some west. The drivers all wait in complete
dialog: silence.
text: Finally, in the distance, the sound of sirens. Coming closer.
scene_heading: LOW ANGLE - THE HIGHWAY
text: as a speck rises over a hill and comes barrelling down the
text: center divider, doing at least 120. A beat and a dozen more
text: specks top the hill and roar down the highway in pursuit.
text: The specks quickly take form. Bandit I followed by a dozen
text: Georgia Highway Patrol cars. The vehicles parked along the
text: shoulder all fire up their engines on cue. And wait.
speaker_heading: NEW ANGLE
text: Bandit I roars past the cars parked along the shoulder.
text: The instant Bandit I clears, the vehicles pull off the
text: shoulder and begin moving down the highway -- eastbound and
text: westbound -- all doing a conservative law-abiding 55.
scene_heading: THE HIGHWAY PATROL CARS
text: come roaring down the eastbound lane and find the road totally
text: blocked by teen-age traffic going both ways. They're stuck.
text: Even the shoulders are blocked by cars from the drive-in.
dialog: Just in case.
text: And as Bandit I disappears around a distant curve:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXPRESSWAY ON RAMP - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Camera follows Bandit I as it shoots down the highway and
text: back onto the Expressway, just ahead of Bandit II.
scene_heading: INTERCUT - INSIDE BANDIT I AND II
text: Everyone breathes a sigh. Bandit clicks over the CB.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: How's the clock, Bandit II.
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: (into mike)
text: Ticking away, but it looks like a
text: clear shot to Hot Town. Green lights
text: and white lines all the way.
text: Kate turns the rear view mirror towards her and straightens
text: her hair. Bandit glances over.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Hey, this could be the biggest house
dialog: I ever played to.
text: Bandit smiles as both he and Cledus trounce on their pedals.
text: As Bandit I and II take off, Atlanta bound, we:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: TWO GEORGIA STATE POLICE CHOPPERS
text: flving high over the highways leading into Atlanta. Over
dialog: this:
scene_heading: CHOPPER PILOT'S VOICE
dialog: Paydirt!
speaker_heading: AERIAL VIEW
text: from the chopper. Bandit I and Bandit II blazing a trail
dialog: toward Atlanta.
speaker_heading: THE CHOPPERS
text: as they swoop down toward camera.
scene_heading: CHOPPER PILOT'S VOICE
dialog: -- We just picked up the Cobra
text: eastbound on Interstate 72 heading
dialog: for the Peach Tree Classic. Over.
speaker_heading: COMMANDER'S VOICE
text: All units converge.
dialog: And now:
scene_heading: A BIRD'S EYE VIEW
dialog: of the Atlanta Expressway arteries. Every type of law
text: enforcement vehicle in the area -- STATE TROOPERS, LOCAL
text: POLICE, HIGHWAY PATROLMEN, the works -- are blowing down the
text: Expressway. Blue, Red and Yellow lights swirling.
scene_heading: CAMERA SWOOPS IN
text: closer and picks up Bandit I and II. Driving like crazy.
text: Leading the pack.
text: The Peach Tree Classic Track looms ahead.
scene_heading: CLOSER STILL - MOVING
text: as TWENTY-SEVEN POLICE CARS converge behind Bandit I and II,
text: forming an endless line of flashing lights.
text: As the Two Bears in the sky fly in low over the Convoy, we
dialog: go:
scene_heading: INSIDE BANDIT I - MOVING
text: The sounds of SIRENS and the WHOOSH of choppers is deafening.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: Talk about being popular...
text: Then he looks up ahead. And is speechless.
scene_heading: WHAT HE SEES - THE ENTRANCE TO THE FAIRGROUNDS
text: Under a huge billboard announcing "The Peach Tree Classic" --
text: is a greeting party. TEN COP CARS block the entrance gate to
text: the raceway. Twenty cops form a line in front of their
text: vehicles. TV cameras are poised.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: as Bandit fires up the CB.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: I hate to say it, man; but I think
dialog: it's over. Time to lay down our hand.
scene_heading: INSIDE BANDIT II - MOVING
text: Fred is now on all four in the front seat. Tail slapping
text: back and forth. Barking like crazy.
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: Are you loco, pardner!?! We've come
dialog: this far.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: Yeah, but...
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: When we agree to do a job, we do it.
dialog: Right?
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: But they're waiting for me. They
dialog: don't even know Cledus Snow exists.
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: (into mike)
dialog: Well, they're gonna. It's time this
text: gearjammer rode to glory.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Now, move aside; good buddy. I'm
text: coming through.
text: And Cledus puts it to the floor.
speaker_heading: NEW ANGLE
text: as the huge eighteen-wheeler takes the bullet lane and passes
text: Bandit I, almost blowing off its doors.
scene_heading: THE CONVOY - MOVING
text: led by Cledus in Bandit II. Roaring toward the race track
text: gate. Hammer down. Stacks open. Horn blaring. Bandit I right
text: on his tail.
text: And behind them, twenty-seven bubble gum machines lighting
dialog: up the Georgia countryside.
scene_heading: FAIRGROUNDS ENTRANCE GATE
text: The COPS see Bandit II -- eighteen-wheels of terror -- roaring
text: down the hill and headed full steam toward them.
scene_heading: ANGLE - THE COPS
text: Some run to their cars as fast as they can, start 'em up and
text: scatter. Others just run as fast as they can, period. Utter
dialog: chaos!
scene_heading: BANDIT II - RACING ANGLE
text: as it comes barrelling toward the entrance gate, cutting
text: right through the remaining Police cars -- sending them
text: reeling.
text: Then the big rig blasts through the entrance gate, demolishing
text: it and sending timber flying sky high.
speaker_heading: NEW ANGLE
text: Bandit II heads for the race track smoke stacks blasting.
text: A beat and Bandit I, followed by half of Atlanta's Smokeys,
text: comes roaring through what's left of the entrance gate.
speaker_heading: IN THE STANDS
text: The "Peach Tree Classic" is in progress. Stock Cars racing
text: full speed around the track. But the CROWD'S attention is
text: turned toward the entrance gate.
scene_heading: ANGLE - KYLE BRAND AND HIS SON DICKEY
text: sitting in a front row box. Kyle has binoculars up to his
text: eyes.
scene_heading: ANGLE - THRU BINOCULARS
text: Bandit I and II roaring straight toward the stands.
text: BACK TO KYLE AND DICKEY
text: Kyle lowers his binoculars and turns to his son.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: That crazy sumbitch made it.
speaker_heading: DICKEY
dialog: Congratulations. You just became a
dialog: legend maker.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE TRACK
text: Stock cars whipping around the curves, as Bandit I and Bandit
text: II cut a path across the infield and roar onto the track --
text: screeching to a halt directly in front of Kyle's box.
speaker_heading: BEHIND THEM
text: The Stock Cars swerve, slide and sail onto the infield --
text: trying to avoid collisions.
text: The Convoy of Police Cars, their sirens blasting and their
text: advertising still swirling, are forced to stop -- as the
text: Stock Cars pile up in front of them. Flags go down. The race
text: is abruptly halted. A helicopter still hovers low overhead.
scene_heading: ANGLE - THE STANDS
text: The doors of Bandit I and II fly open and Bandit, Kate and
text: Cledus all pile out and head for Kyle's box.
scene_heading: CLOSER ANGLE - THE BOX
text: All eyes are on Bandit, Cledus, Kate, Kyle and Dickey.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: (trying to act casual)
dialog: You got my barley pop?
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: DICKEY
dialog: (toothy smile)
dialog: Have any trouble getting here?
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: About one to five years worth.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (turning to Bandit,
dialog: stunned)
dialog: One to five?
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (hopefully)
dialog: Maybe six months with good behavior.
dialog: (resigned)
dialog: One to five.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: (coughs, then)
dialog: Well, I guess I gotta hand it to
dialog: you.
text: He reaches into his pocket and brings out a shiny new set of
text: keys. He then gestures toward the sidelines. They all turn.
dialog: WHAT THEY SEE
text: The late afternoon sun sparkles off the chrome smokestacks
text: of a brand-new KENWORTH EIGHTEEN-WHEELER.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: Kyle hands Bandit the keys.
text: Behind them, the POLICE have all jumped out of their cars --
text: (which now, along with the stock cars, cover the entire
text: infield -- ) and are rushing toward Bandit and Cledus.
speaker_heading: DICKEY
dialog: (toothy grin)
dialog: I wonder if they'll let you take a K-
dialog: Whooper to prison?
speaker_heading: CLEDUS
dialog: (to Kyle)
dialog: Mind if I cream your son?
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: (to Bandit)
dialog: Don't sweat it. I'll have y'all out
dialog: on bail in no time. Fools like you
dialog: are valuable.
scene_heading: NEW ANGLE - TRACKING - ACROSS THE TRACK
text: as Bandit, Kate and Cledus start across, toward the oncoming
text: rush of police.
dialog: As they walk:
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (to Kate)
dialog: Well, at least it hasn't been boring.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Well, thanks for the lift.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (it was nothing)
dialog: Hey...
text: There's a long pause. The cops are now closing in. Cledus
text: walks toward them -- arms outstretched.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (after an uneasy beat)
dialog: What can I say?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Promise me you won't fall in love
text: with an inmate.
text: He grins. The cops are on top of them. Handcuffs on Bandit.
text: Kate moves forward, pushing the cops out of the way. And
dialog: kisses Bandit.
speaker_heading: THE STANDS
text: as five thousand people cheer.
speaker_heading: NEW ANGLE
text: Suddenly, a deafening ROAR is heard O.S. and all heads turn
dialog: to see:
scene_heading: SHERIFF CLAYTON'S CAR
text: storming through the gate and across the infield. The Texas
text: Highway Patrol car is almost a complete wreck. So is the
dialog: driver.
text: The car comes to a skidding halt and Sheriff Buell Clayton
text: leaps out. He heads straight toward Bandit -- fists clenched.
speaker_heading: CLAYTON
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: Get your hands off my daughter!
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: Your what?
text: Clayton takes about five more frenzied steps, then suddenly
text: drops to the ground. And faints. Out cold.
text: Everybody rushes forward, thinking the poor son-of-a-bitch
text: is dead.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (to Bandit)
text: He's just exhausted.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: That man is your father?!?
text: She nods. Then:
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I should've told you, but you would've
dialog: thrown me out, right?
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: Absolutely.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (speeding)
dialog: Listen, he's nuts. I mean certifiable.
dialog: But believe it or not, he once looked
dialog: great in Levis. That's why my mother
dialog: married him. But like all good
dialog: things...
dialog: (then)
dialog: I know what you're thinking.
text: Bandit says nothing.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: What are you thinking?
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: (looking over at
dialog: Clayton, still out
dialog: cold)
dialog: You gotta admire the man's
dialog: determination.
text: She hugs him. A beat and the cops push Bandit and Cledus
text: into the back seat of the lead squad car.
text: As Two Cops move around the front, Kate leans in the rear
dialog: window.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE SQUAD CAR
text: Bandit and Cledus. Handcuffed.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (to the guys)
dialog: Well, was it worth it?
text: Bandit and Cledus look at each other. Then nod. Then laugh.
text: Kate laughs with them.
text: Then the Two Cops hop in the front seat, as the other Twenty-
text: Six Smokey's head for their cars.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (to Cledus)
dialog: I'll take care of Fred.
text: And now it's almost over. The Cop starts up the engine. Kate
text: and Bandit look at each other for a long moment.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: See ya, Bandit.
speaker_heading: BANDIT
dialog: See ya, Kate.
text: Kate backs away from the window, as the squad car pulls out,
text: followed by the endless line of Atlanta's finest.
text: Their sirens now silent. But their advertising still flashing.
text: And now, as we pull further and further away, watching the
dialog: whole event become history...
dialog: We hear:
speaker_heading: VOICE ONE
dialog: -- Breaker, Breaker. This is Banana
dialog: Peel.
speaker_heading: VOICE TWO
dialog: -- Yeah, Banana Peel, go head on.
speaker_heading: VOICE ONE
dialog: -- Did ya hear they nailed the Bandit?
speaker_heading: VOICE TWO
dialog: -- Yeah, I heard. But they won't
dialog: hold him for long. Anyway, he sure
dialog: gave them sumbitches a run for their
dialog: money.
dialog: And:
speaker_heading: FADE OUT:
speaker_heading: THE END
dialog:
