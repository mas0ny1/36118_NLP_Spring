scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: LYNN, asleep, squirms on the bed. She's early thirties, very
text: pretty, thin-bodied. She MUMBLES in discomfort.
dialog: 
scene_heading: IN HER DREAM
dialog: 
text: is A YOUNG GIRL in the back seat of a station wagon. She
text: plays with a Barbie, shows it toward CAMERA at the people O.S.
dialog: 
text: Someone SHOUTS, high-pitched but distorted in a dream-like
dialog: fashion.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Henry, watch out--!
dialog: 
text: The young girl's eyes move up from her Barbie toward the
text: front of the car--slow, too slow.
dialog: 
text: EVERYTHING SPEEDS UP, the frame shaking like an epileptic
text: suddenly got hold of the camera.
dialog: 
text: Only a half-second has passed, but the young girl is now
text: lying sideways on the back seat and her forehead is smeared
dialog: with blood.
dialog: 
text: She sits up slowly, dazed. Whatever she sees in the front
text: seat disturbs her. Her lip begins to shake, tears welling in
text: her eyes.
dialog: 
text: Something pops into her peripheral vision. She turns.
dialog: 
text: A CLOWN has appeared in the window next to her. He SHOUTS
text: something unintelligible to her, and then RIPS HIS CLOWN FACE
text: OFF to reveal a bloody skull--
dialog: 
dialog: The little girl SCREAMS--
dialog: 
text: --and Lynn bolts upright on her bed, screaming. She stops
text: immediately as she realizes where she is, but it takes her a
dialog: moment to calm down.
dialog: 
text: She turns to the clock--it's 5:38.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Shit.
dialog: 
text: She jumps up and heads for the shower.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT - EVENING
dialog: 
text: Small neighborhood diner. Wooden chairs and small tables.
text: Lynn rushes in and spots JULIE sitting alone. She rushes over
text: to join her friend.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I am so sorry--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (friendly ribbing)
dialog: Sure, whatever it is is so
dialog: important that you don't want to
dialog: tell me on the phone, but it's not
dialog: so important you can't be--
dialog: (checks watch)
text: --a half hour late.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I fell asleep--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
text: (pointing at an empty
dialog: plate)
dialog: Look! I finished all the chicken
dialog: fingers. I'm going to have to go
dialog: to the bathroom and make myself
dialog: throw up.
dialog: 
text: Lynn smirks at her friend and sits down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I need a drink.
dialog: 
text: She motions for the waitress and orders a glass of red wine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: So spill.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: (swallows, takes a
dialog: breath)
dialog: I'm getting a divorce, Julie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Shut up.
dialog: 
text: She sees that Lynn's not kidding and her smiles lowers like
text: a draw-bridge.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: What? Since when?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Things have been bad for...about
dialog: a year now. I guess things have
dialog: never been that great.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Well...I just...why didn't you
dialog: tell me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: You know...you're--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Don't even. I'm your friend first.
dialog: Manager second.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I thought we could work it out.
dialog: Bert kept making promises and I
dialog: kept waiting for him to keep them.
dialog: Guess what I just found out.
dialog: (doesn't give her a
dialog: chance)
text: His ex-wife's name is still on the
dialog: deed to the house. The house I'm
dialog: living in. He said as soon as I
dialog: sold my house and moved in, he'd
dialog: have it taken off. And you know
dialog: how I found out her name's still
dialog: on it?
dialog: 
text: Julie shakes her head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: The internet. I had to find out on
dialog: the goddamn internet.
dialog: 
text: She realizes her voice has started to rise in volume, so she
text: takes a sip of her recently-delivered wine, and calms herself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I don't know if that was the final
dialog: straw. It was everything. Julie,
dialog: I don't know anything about him.
dialog: I don't know how much money he
dialog: makes because he didn't want us to
dialog: have a joint checking account. He
dialog: always says he's working late at
dialog: night but he won't give me a
dialog: number to call other than his cel
dialog: phone. And that place...it gives
dialog: me the creeps.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: It's a sanitarium. They do that.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: (shrugs, moot point)
dialog: I told him I was leaving and that
dialog: I was taking Nicky. He hit me.
dialog: 
text: Julie is shocked.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: He...hit you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: (nods)
dialog: I was packing some things. I said
dialog: I was taking Nicky and I'd be
dialog: filing for a divorce. He hit me in
text: the back of the head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Did you call the police?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: No. I just wanted to get out of
dialog: there. That was a month ago.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: You separated a month ago and
dialog: didn't tell me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I didn't want to bother you, what
dialog: with all the stuff you've already
dialog: got on your plate...
dialog: 
text: She stops as she sees the look on Julie's face; How
dialog: Ridiculous.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: So what are you going to do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Get the divorce. Once I get full
dialog: custody of Nicky, I'll start
dialog: trying to reassemble what's left
dialog: of my life. In California.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: You're going to move?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I told Phillip yesterday. I didn't
dialog: tell him why.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: How'd he take it?
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: He was shocked, you know, at
dialog: first. But he was very supportive
dialog: as always.
dialog: 
text: Julie pulls out her cel phone and starts dialing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Okay, the first thing I'm going to
dialog: do is cancel the exhibit tomorrow
dialog: night--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Nononononono, please Julie.
dialog: 
text: Julie reluctantly hangs up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: You've worked so hard, and to tell
dialog: you the truth, it'll be good to
dialog: meet some new people. Take my mind
dialog: off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Lynn. We'll just postpone it. I
dialog: don't think it's a good idea for
dialog: you to be doing an exhibit when
dialog: you've got this much on your mind.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: It'll be good. No, great.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: You sure? Really sure?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Really.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Where are you staying?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: A friend of mine is out of the
dialog: country for a couple months. She
dialog: said I could stay at her house
dialog: until I find someplace of my own.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: What about Nicholas?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Every other day. The lawyers had
dialog: a temporary agreement drawn up.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: In this state, you'll have no
dialog: trouble getting sole custody.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: (nods)
dialog: I'm not worried about that. It's
dialog: just...this can't be my life,
dialog: Julie. I can't be a divorced
dialog: mother. I just, I can't.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: People change, Lynn.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: (wistful)
dialog: I don't think I ever really knew
dialog: him in the first place...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The moon casts a faint light through the window. Lynn is
text: asleep in her bed, this time without the nightmares.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OUR VIEW
dialog: 
text: looks down upon her, and for a moment there's the impression
text: that someone is in the bedroom standing over her. But then we
dialog: 
text: MOVE slowly across the bed toward the window, passing the
text: nightlight plugged into the wall panel, right up to the
dialog: window and
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THROUGH IT
dialog: 
text: into the dark night. We get a nice bird's eye view of the
dialog: street.
dialog: 
text: Pools of black shadow lie everywhere. The houses along the
text: street are all dark grey shapes set against a starless sky.
text: Each house appears very middle-class suburban.
dialog: 
text: All is quiet. Still.
dialog: 
text: Across the street from Lynn's, SOMETHING MOVES FROM UNDER THE
text: SHADOW OF A TREE.
dialog: 
text: Still hidden in the darkness under the leaves, it's
text: impossible to tell what it is. Then THE CLOWN moves into the
text: light and we can see he's got some sort of bag in his hand.
text: The streetlight above catches him in total silhouette, so
text: it's impossible to tell much about him.
text: And yet, there's something definitely sinister about him. Is
text: it the peculiar sight of a clown standing in a deserted
dialog: street in the dead of night? Or something else...?
dialog: 
text: The clown scans the houses across the street and his gaze
text: stops at the house two doors up from Lynn.
dialog: 
text: He turns to look directly at Lynn's house, and makes a
text: shrugging motion, very much like, "What can I do? My hands
dialog: are tied."
dialog: 
text: He moves across the street, taking a new grip on whatever's
text: in the bag, and the bag falls into the street.
dialog: 
text: He holds a giant axe. Even in the dim light, the silver axe-
text: blade gleams like mercury.
dialog: 
text: Silently, the house awaits his entrance. Taking his time, he
text: moves toward the door.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Lynn rushes out of her house, clearly late for something. She
text: stops in confusion as she sees five cop cars and an ambulance
text: in front of the house two doors down.
dialog: 
text: A good bunch of the neighbors--moms and kids--stand about in
text: groups, pointing and asking questions. Lynn goes over to a
text: neighbor, GALE, a chubby motherly type who's shaking her head
text: without realizing it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Excuse me...I'm house-sitting for
dialog: Margaret. Could you tell me what's
dialog: going on?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: (tsks)
dialog: Oh it's just awful. If we're not
dialog: safe here, where on earth can we
dialog: possibly move to?
dialog: 
text: She tsks again, but otherwise isn't forthcoming.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Do you know what happened?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
text: The Olsons. All of them. Killed
dialog: while they slept.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Killed?
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Butchered, from what I hear.
dialog: (off Lynn's look)
dialog: I know. How could something like
dialog: that happen here? While we slept?
dialog: This is a nice neighborhood.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: My god...
dialog: 
text: She breaks it off and shakes her head.
dialog: 
text: DETECTIVE PETERS, a young guy who looks more like a rock star
text: incognito, wanders over with a pad of paper.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: Morning folks. You all know the
dialog: Olsons?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Of course. Who are you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: Sorry.
dialog: (flashes the badge)
dialog: Detective Peters. Homicide, of
dialog: course. Either of you happen to
dialog: hear or see anything unusual last
dialog: night?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Why yes.
dialog: (Peters is interested)
text: There was a carfull of raving
text: psychopaths parked in front of the
dialog: house about midnight, but I
dialog: figured if we left them alone,
dialog: they'd go away.
dialog: 
text: Detective Peters is put off by the sarcasm coming from
text: someone who appears so motherly. He looks to Lynn, who smiles
dialog: uncomfortably.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: Maam. I need to know if you saw
dialog: anything out of the ordinary last
dialog: night, or heard anything.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Don't you think I'd have called
dialog: the police in that case?
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: Maybe. Maybe not. It might not
dialog: have struck you as strange at the
dialog: time, but maybe now, with what's
dialog: happened...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: What exactly happened?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: (not particularly
dialog: sympathetic)
dialog: Your neighbors have been murdered.
dialog: I can't tell you any more than
dialog: that right now.
dialog: 
text: He hands them both a card.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: If something comes to you, give me
dialog: a ring huh?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: That's all? That's all the
dialog: questions you're going to ask?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: Oh hey. Sorry. Did either of you
dialog: happen to kill the Olsons?
dialog: 
text: Gale is not amused. Lynn's watching them carry a bodybag on
text: a stretcher out of the Olsons' house. Something about the
text: sight has trapped her gaze.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: (didn't really need
dialog: an answer anyway)
dialog: Okay. Thanks. One of my guys will
dialog: be over to take your names.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Detective? I'm sorry, I'm already
dialog: late.
text: (she digs in her
text: purse and pulls out
dialog: a card)
dialog: This has my name and cel phone
dialog: number on it. I'm...house sitting
dialog: here for the next couple of weeks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: (looking at the card)
dialog: An artist, huh? You don't much
dialog: look like an artist.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Says the rock-star detective.
dialog: 
text: Peters spares her a glance, but ignores her. The way Lynn
text: stumbled over the half-lie seems to have caught the
text: detective's attention.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: How long you been...house sitting?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: About four, no, five nights.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: (nods his head)
dialog: I may have to come by later and
dialog: ask you a few questions, Miss...
dialog: (checks the card
dialog: again)
dialog: Blodgett.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Sure, I understand.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Oh, no! I'm sorry, I've got an
dialog: exhibit tonight, so I won't be
dialog: back at all today. Tomorrow should
dialog: be fine though.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Why don't you leave her alone? Do
dialog: you think she did it? Is that what
dialog: your keen detective mind is
dialog: telling you?
dialog: 
text: The detective turns a bemused smile on Gale.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: Wow. You're Miss Cleaver on the
dialog: outside, but the inside's a real
dialog: bitch, ain't it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Ex-cuse me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: I guess I'm not so good with the
text: sarcastic reh-par-tee.
dialog: 
text: He stumbles over the word like it's too hard to wrap his
text: tongue around, but there's a quiet intelligence in his eyes.
text: An intelligence that just filed Gale under "B" for bitch.
dialog: 
text: He wanders off shaking his head.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: His superior's going to hear about
dialog: this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: (rushing off)
dialog: Well, it was nice meeting you, I'm
dialog: really really late now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: (calls after her)
dialog: I'm Gale. Gale Wroten.
dialog: 
text: Lynn waves back without looking and hightails it to the car.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GALLERY - DAY
dialog: 
text: The gallery looks new. Shiny hardwood floors. Small rooms
text: showcase paintings on the wall, with new wave furniture
text: awaiting the pretentious ass of some wannabe art critic.
dialog: 
text: Lynn rushes in. AMANDA, 23, steps out with a clipboard. She's
text: cute in a mousy, Lisa Loeb kind of way.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMANDA
dialog: Lynn, hey.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Sorry I'm late. You'll never
dialog: believe the morning I'm having.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMANDA
dialog: No worries. Everything's going
dialog: pretty hokay. OOPS still hasn't
dialog: delivered two of the pieces, but
dialog: everything else is here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Phil around?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMANDA
dialog: Yup.
dialog: 
text: As if he heard, PHILLIP REID rounds the corner. He's kind-
text: faced, late thirties, dressed in an old-fashioned brown
text: suit-and-vest. He's got the makings of a slight gut.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: Lynn, some of these new pieces are
dialog: amazing! You've been doing great
dialog: work lately. Fabulous stuff.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Thanks, Phil. And thank you so
dialog: much for this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: It's my pleasure.
dialog: (takes on an
dialog: aristocratic air)
dialog: You know how prestigious it is to
text: once again be showcasing the great
dialog: Lynn Blodgett at my gallery.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Oh, please.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: If Picasso were still alive, I'd
dialog: turn him down to get you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMANDA
dialog: Ass kisser.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Well, thanks. It means a lot to me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: What do you think? Should we
dialog: expect a crowd tonight?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMANDA
dialog: I think you'll be pleasantly
dialog: surprised...
dialog: 
text: On Lynn's questioning look...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GALLERY - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Same place, plus a hundred people. No one speaks loud. It's
text: all QUIET MURMURS over wine or mixed drinks.
dialog: 
text: Lynn's standing against a back wall with Amanda. She looks
text: dazed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: (quiet)
dialog: How...on earth...did you get all
dialog: these people here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMANDA
dialog: WWW dot I hate clowns dot com. I
dialog: posted it on their message
dialog: board.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: But...if they hate clowns, why
dialog: would they come?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMANDA
dialog: It's a love-hate thing.
dialog: 
text: Lynn shakes her head; she doesn't understand, but who's
dialog: complaining?
dialog: 
text: She touches Amanda's arm to signal that she's moving. She
text: begins to weave aimlessly among the people, pausing just long
text: enough to catch whether they like her stuff or not. Most seem
dialog: to.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INTO ANOTHER ROOM
dialog: 
text: not as crowded as the main room. A COUPLE murmurs about the
text: painting in front of them, while across the room is TUCK, 28.
text: He's dark-skinned Latino, dressed like a model. He's staring
text: deeply at one of Lynn's clown paintings.
dialog: 
text: She sidles up, trying to be sly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: So what do you think?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
text: (spares her a quick
dialog: look, then back to
dialog: the painting)
dialog: I'm not an art critic or
dialog: anything...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Who is?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: (nods, then back to
dialog: the painting)
dialog: It's okay. I don't know what the
dialog: clown fetish is all about--I think
dialog: the artist has issues.
dialog: 
text: Lynn smiles. Not what she expected to hear.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: (good-natured)
dialog: Oh?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Well...they're clowns, for
dialog: chrissakes.
dialog: But hers are all so...scary. Did
dialog: you see the one where you walk in?
dialog: I think I remember that one from
dialog: Stephen King's It.
dialog: 
text: Lynn smiles. She's looking forward to embarrassing him when
text: she introduces herself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: But you're no art critic.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: No. Tucker Flynn. My friends call
dialog: me Tuck.
dialog: 
text: He extends his hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Lynn--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: --Blodgett, I know.
dialog: (mischievous smile)
dialog: I saw your picture in the program.
dialog: 
text: She smiles and reappraises him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: I didn't want to blow your cover.
dialog: Not right away anyway.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: So what do you really think?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: They're good. I mean...they're
dialog: great.
dialog: (the smile returns)
dialog: You've still got issues, but...I
dialog: think they're phenomenal.
dialog: 
text: She can tell he's sincere about his appreciation. She's
dialog: touched.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Thanks. You from the web site?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Web site?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Oh, nothing. What made you stop by
dialog: tonight?
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: This is the best gallery in
dialog: Baltimore. I've bought a couple of
dialog: pieces here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Anything of mine?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: No. Honestly, I never noticed your
dialog: stuff before, but I'll definitely
dialog: be keeping my eye out now.
dialog: 
text: There are serious looks going on between them, a quick
text: chemistry that seems to be catching Lynn off guard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Well...I hope you have a good time.
dialog: 
text: She starts to move off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Hey. You wanna--
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: --maybe go out and get a drink
dialog: later?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Uh---
dialog: 
text: Is she searching for an excuse or thinking about accepting?
dialog: She's married, she can't be going out on dates.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: It's just a bad time.
dialog: 
text: He smiles his understanding.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Sure. No problem.
dialog: 
text: She turns to move off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: How 'bout tomorrow?
dialog: 
text: She stops.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: It's complicated.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I'm married.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: (sudden
dialog: understanding)
dialog: Ooooh...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I mean, I'm separated.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: (no problem then)
dialog: Oh. Great. I mean, not great like
dialog: I'm happy about it---
dialog: (realizes he's
dialog: screwing up)
dialog: Hi. I'm Tuck. I'll be right back.
dialog: 
text: He heads over to the nearest tuxedo's waiter and grabs a
text: champagne glass. He holds it up to toast Lynn, then DOWNS it
text: in one swallows.
dialog: 
text: Then he grabs two others off the tray and returns to
dialog: Lynn.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: I thought if it didn't cost too
dialog: much, I could get a guided tour of
dialog: your work.
dialog: 
text: Lynn smiles at his persistance. There's something immaturely
text: endearing about him. His smile is contagious.
dialog: 
text: She takes the drink.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I could probably put it on your
dialog: tab.
dialog: 
text: Tuck's glad she's going along for the ride. He steps up to
text: the painting in front of them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Take this one. I notice that this
dialog: clown seems to be in a lot of your
dialog: paintings. What's the significance?
dialog: 
text: The more astute viewers will recognize the clown as the one
text: from the dream in the beginning. In the painting, he's
text: staring out at us with a look of sinister intent. He's in a
text: stark white hallway with strange objects on the wall.
text: She stares at it intently, as if she's never seen it before,
text: as if she's falling into it.
dialog: 
text: An excited Amanda pops up behind her, saving her from
dialog: answering.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMANDA
dialog: Boss. The mayor is here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: The mayor? Of the city?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMANDA
dialog: No, of Sesame Street.
dialog: (notices Tuck)
dialog: Who's the hunk?
dialog: 
text: Lynn's still shocked about the mayor thing, but not so much
dialog: that she can't be embarrassed too.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Sorry. Tuck, this is my number one
dialog: cheerleader, Amanda. She created
dialog: my web site and does all my other
dialog: promotion for me.
dialog: 
text: Tuck smiles at her ga-ga expression.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Nice to meet you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMANDA
dialog: Um hmmm. I'd like to shake my bon
dialog: bons all over your--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Amanda. Go tell Phillip I'll be
dialog: right over.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMANDA
dialog: Okay.
dialog: 
text: She gives Tuck one last lascivious look, and then she's off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Sorry about that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: It's flattering.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I guess I should go say hi to the
dialog: mayor.
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Is he really here, or is that just
dialog: a ploy you two use to impress
dialog: people?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I think he's really here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Impressive. Can I get your
dialog: autograph later?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Sure. Hang around. I'll be back.
dialog: 
text: She gives him a fleeting smile and walks away. As soon as her
text: back is turned to him, she makes a face. What the hell is she
dialog: doing?
dialog: 
text: And then her expression turns to dismayed shock.
dialog: 
text: BERT, her soon-to-be ex-husband, rounds the corner, a wine
text: glass in hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Lynn! There you are.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: (quiet)
dialog: What the hell are you doing here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: What? What's the matter?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Who's watching Nicky?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: He's in great hands, don't worry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: So why are you here, Bert?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: I came to see your new exhibit, of
dialog: course.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Bert. What the hell is wrong with
dialog: you? We're not friends.
dialog: (as if he's forgotten)
dialog: You filed for divorce.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Only because you were going to.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: We're not doing this here. Please
dialog: leave.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Don't get all apoplectic on me. I
dialog: didn't realize you'd get so upset.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Why wouldn't I? This is an
dialog: important night for me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: All right. I'll go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: 
text: He takes a final sip of his drink before putting it down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: I'll call you later.
dialog: 
text: He's gone before he can see the look of disgust that crosses
text: Lynn's face.
dialog: 
text: She takes a calming breath before she goes looking for the
dialog: mayor.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GALLERY - LATER
dialog: 
text: The crowd is mostly gone. Lynn's walking through room after
text: room. She's looking for Tuck, but trying not to act like it.
dialog: 
text: Room after room(and blank spaces reveal that the gallery was
text: successful in moving some of her paintings) and no Tuck.
text: She's starting to get discouraged.
dialog: 
text: She comes back around to the front counter and there he is
text: talking with Phil. Lynn suppresses a smile.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: Here she comes!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Can I get that autograph now?
dialog: 
text: He lifts something from the counter that was hidden behind
text: his body. It's one of Lynn's paintings.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: But...that's...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: Your new admirer just purchased
dialog: your most expensive piece, my dear.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: That's eight thousand dollars...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: And worth every penny. When it's
dialog: worth two-hundred grand, you'll
dialog: beg to buy it back.
dialog: (to Phillip)
dialog: Go ahead and wrap it up. I'll get
dialog: her to autograph it once it's
dialog: hanging up in my house.
dialog: 
text: Phillip doesn't get it for a moment. Then he sees the blush
text: on Lynn's cheek. He gets it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: Oh. Oh...of course.
dialog: 
text: He begins wrapping as Lynn and Tuck exchange looks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Do you mind me asking what you do,
dialog: Tuck?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Wanna see?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: (playful flirting)
dialog: I think that would depend on what
dialog: it is you do.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: I'm just, uh, I've got to get some
text: tape from the other room.
dialog: 
text: Clearly uncomfortable with their flirting, he goes into
text: another room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Seriously. You want to see what I
dialog: do, my office isn't very far away.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Okay. But only because you just
dialog: paid my rent for three
dialog: months.
dialog: (louder toward the
dialog: other room)
dialog: Phillip, I'll be back soon. I'm
text: going to see Mr. Flynn's office.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GALLERY
dialog: 
text: Tuck escorts Lynn outside and opens the passenger door of his
text: Porsche. He shuts the door after she pulls her legs in.
dialog: 
text: ACROSS THE STREET
dialog: 
text: in the shadows of an alley stands a man. He watches as Tuck
text: gets in the Porsche, starts it and drives away.
dialog: 
text: As it exits the scene, the man steps forward to watch its
text: progress. We see it's Bert, a menacing scowl on his face.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TUCK'S OFFICE - LATER
dialog: 
text: Tuck lets Lynn into the office. She takes a look around as he
text: goes to the alarm and turns it off. The office is very nice.
text: Clean, well-organized, tastefully decorated.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: This is my office.
dialog: 
text: It's big. She walks down the hall, Tuck following behind her,
text: indulging her whim to lead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: So...what do you do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Look at the pictures.
dialog: 
text: She's been walking by the pictures on the wall, but now she
text: stops to take a better look. The pictures seem to be of
text: elaborate roller coasters at various theme parks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I still don't get it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: My company designs roller
dialog: coasters. Disney, King's Dominion,
dialog: Busch Gardens, you name it. I've
dialog: got a coaster there.
dialog: 
text: Lynn's impressed.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: How old are you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Old enough to pick touch football
text: over tackle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Why don't you want to tell me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: How old are you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Touche.
dialog: 
text: She's peering close to one picture. It shows some crazy
text: sumbitch standing on the highest point of a tall roller
dialog: coaster, no car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: That's me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: No.
dialog: 
text: She looks closer. It's a far off shot, but it sure looks like
dialog: it could be him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Every time they finish a new
dialog: coaster of mine, I like to stand
text: at the highest point.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: You're out of your mind.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: I'm a thrill seeker, what can I
dialog: say?
dialog: 
text: The playful smile never leaves his face. She's clearly amazed
text: at the guts it takes to do what he does.
dialog: 
text: Tuck leans in close over her shoulder as she stares at
text: another picture.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Impressed?
dialog: 
text: She's not spooked by how close he is. She doesn't want to let
text: on that she's impressed though.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I don't really like roller
dialog: coasters.
dialog: 
text: He's non-plussed. He moves past her down the hall toward an
text: exit door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: How do you feel about...
dialog: 
text: He opens the door and flicks on the light. It's a giant game
text: room. A pool table in the center. A twenty foot shuffleboard
text: game to the side. A big screen TV in the corner with a sofa
text: in front of it. A refrigerator, the works.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: ...shuffleboard?
dialog: 
text: She follows him into the room. It's getting harder and harder
dialog: to hide being impressed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Can I get you a beer?
dialog: 
text: He's at the fridge. Lynn has a moment. Put a halt to it right
dialog: now, before it all gets out of hand. The reasons are many: In
text: the middle of a divorce, Tuck is younger than she is, she's
dialog: got a kid. She doesn't even really know this guy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Sure.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: (as he's getting them)
dialog: So how'd you get set up at the
dialog: gallery?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Oh, Phillip owns it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Seems awfully young to own an art
dialog: gallery, doesn't he? I picture
dialog: gallery owners as, you know, over
dialog: fifty.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: He inherited it when his parents
dialog: died.
dialog: (sheepish)
dialog: It seems funny now, but I actually
dialog: met him...on the internet. An art
dialog: forum.
dialog: When he found out I was in the
dialog: same city, and a painter...he
dialog: offered to take a look at my stuff.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: I guess he liked it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: (nods)
dialog: We've had a bunch of showings, but
dialog: none went like tonight.
dialog: 
text: For a second she looks like she thinks she shouldn't have
text: said that. She breaks eye contact, but quickly looks back and
text: smiles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: So how about a game of pool?
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. TUCK'S OFFICE - LATER
dialog: 
text: Tuck locks up the office behind them as they leave.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Not to sound sexist, but for a
dialog: girl, you're pretty good at pool.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Not to sound sexist?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Yeah, that's why I prefaced it
dialog: that way.
dialog: 
text: From around a bush steps a MUGGER. He's mean-faced and alert.
dialog: All business.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUGGER
dialog: Gimme your money.
dialog: 
text: Tuck moves protectively in front of Lynn. The mugger's not
text: intimidated, more interested in Lynn.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUGGER
dialog: Gimme the purse and there won't be
dialog: no trouble.
dialog: 
text: Tuck eyes the mugger for a moment, then holds his hand out to
text: Lynn. She gives him the purse.
dialog: 
text: He tosses it to the mugger, who catches it in his knifeless
text: hand. The mugger reaches in, pulls out the wallet and pockets
text: it. He smiles a little more confidently.
speaker_heading: MUGGER
dialog: What else she got?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: You got the money. Get out of
dialog: here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUGGER
dialog: I think you best run off,
dialog: loverboy. I'll see her home.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Take the easy score. It's all
dialog: downhill from here.
dialog: 
text: The mugger edges in. Tuck pushes Lynn back farther.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: (never taking his
dialog: eyes off the mugger)
dialog: When you get the chance Lynn,
text: throw a rock at my office window.
dialog: 
text: The mugger rushes. He feints and slashes across Tuck's
text: stomach. Tuck jumps back, but there's a rip across his shirt
dialog: now.
dialog: 
text: Holding the knife up, the mugger admires the thin red coat
text: now along one side.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUGGER
dialog: Wanna reconsider, loverboy?
dialog: 
text: Nothing from Tuck. Still riveted on the mugger.
dialog: 
text: The mugger takes two steps and jabs the knife. Tuck steps to
text: the side, grabs the mugger's hand and jams an elbow into his
dialog: side.
dialog: 
text: The instant Tuck grabs the mugger's arm, LYNN HURLS HER
text: KEYCHAIN, five pounds of keys, at the office door. It doesn't
text: shatter the window, but spider-web cracks appear and a LOUD
text: ALARM BEGINS GOING OFF inside.
dialog: 
text: When Tuck elbows the mugger, he drops the knife. Tuck uses
text: his weight to whirl the mugger away from him, causing him to
text: tumble off balance and fall. A METALLIC CLATTER as a gun
text: falls out of the mugger's waistband.
dialog: 
text: The mugger snatches the gun.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Run!
text: Lynn and Tuck run off toward the end of the building.
dialog: 
text: The mugger briefly points his gun at the fleeing couple, but
text: something keeps him from firing. He's pissed. He spares one
text: irritated glance toward where the alarm is WAILING, and he
text: runs off in the other direction.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:

scene_heading: INT. CAR - LATER
dialog: 
text: Tuck's car pulls up in front of the house Lynn's staying in.
text: Lynn, exhausted, doesn't move to open the door right away.
text: She stares at the house.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: You sure you're all right? I can
dialog: take you to a friend's house...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I'm okay. You're the one who got
dialog: stabbed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Slashed, not stabbed. I've done
dialog: worse shaving.
dialog: 
text: Lynn nods absently as if she's not even listening. She
text: reaches for the door handle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Well...good night.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Hey.
dialog: 
text: He grabs her arm gently.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: I'll call you tomorrow.
dialog: 
text: She barely nods, gets out of the car and walks to her house.
text: Tuck waits until she's in the house before he pulls away.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE
dialog: 
text: Lynn leans back against the front door and closes her eyes.
text: Exhausted. With the mugging on top of her exhibit, it's just
text: too much. She's ready to drop.
dialog: 
text: She trudges into the kitchen and pours herself a glass of
text: wine. The PHONE RINGS.
text: She spares a look at the clock--pretty late for a call--and
text: picks up the phone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Hello?
dialog: 
text: Behind her, something outside moves past the kitchen windows.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP (PHONE)
dialog: Lynn?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Phillip? What are you doing up
dialog: this late?
dialog: 
text: A non-rhythmic tapping can be heard coming from somewhere in
text: the other room. Like a branch against a window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP (PHONE)
dialog: You've had me worried sick. I've
dialog: called ten times since eleven
dialog: o'clock.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: But...why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP (PHONE)
dialog: You leave the exhibit with some
dialog: strange man you don't even know,
dialog: and you wonder why I'm worrying?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: You're right. I'm sorry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: Where have you been all this time?
dialog: 
text: Lynn notices the tapping. She moves into the television room.
text: The tapping seems to be coming from outside the sliding glass
dialog: door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Long story. Long long story.
dialog: 
text: She can't see anything outside the window, it's so dark.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: You'll never believe what happened.
dialog: 
text: She flicks on the lightswitch next to the door.
dialog: 
text: The clown stands there revealed in the light. Like Lynn's
text: worst nightmare, like the clown in the painting Tuck pointed
text: out, the one that Lynn paints often, the one from her dream.
text: His pupil-less eyes, however, are black as night. The
text: soulless eyes of a shark.
dialog: 
text: He's staring right at Lynn.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP (PHONE)
dialog: What? What happened?
dialog: 
text: The clown cocks his head and leans closer, his breath fogging
text: the glass. Lynn faints, the phone dropping uselessly to the
dialog: rug.
dialog: 
text: With a rumble, the sliding glass door opens to the clown's
text: pull. He steps inside the house.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP (PHONE)
dialog: Lynn? Hello?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FADE OUT:
dialog: 
text: From the BLACK comes voices. Echoes, distant and distorted.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: (coming into focus)
dialog: Can you hear me? Miss Blodgett,
dialog: can you open your eyes?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN'S POV
dialog: 
text: as she opens her eyes. Someone's leaning over her waving
text: something under her nose. It's a MEDIC.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MEDIC
dialog: You with me now?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Yes...
dialog: 
text: She sits up with his help.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MEDIC
dialog: Do you feel okay? Does anything
dialog: hurt?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: No. I don't think so.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MEDIC
dialog: Did you hit your head when you
dialog: fell?
dialog: 
text: Lynn sees there's a COP standing behind the medic listening.
text: His presence distracts her for a moment.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Uh...no. I don't think so.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MEDIC
dialog: Do you want to go to the hospital?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: No. I'm all right.
dialog: 
text: The medic nods and begins to pack up his things as Lynn moves
text: to a chair. The cop steps forward.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: So what happened?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I--
dialog: (the remembrance
dialog: floods back)
dialog: --there was someone standing
text: outside my back door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Right here?
dialog: 
text: He points to the sliding glass door which is open about two
dialog: inches.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: It was open when we got here.
dialog: 
text: Lynn's eyes widen. It was open? It--the clown--came into the
dialog: house?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: We'll search the house. I don't
dialog: think anyone else is here though.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: How did you know to come?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: A friend of yours called. Said he
dialog: was talking to you on the phone
dialog: and it sounded like you collapsed.
dialog: Can you describe the guy that was
dialog: outside your door?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
text: He was dressed like a clown.
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: What? A what?
dialog: 
text: There's a TAP on the front screen door. They look to see
text: Detective Peters letting himself in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: (to Lynn)
dialog: 'Scuse me a minute.
dialog: 
text: He intercepts Peters before he can make it over. There's
text: HUSHED CONVERSATION between them ending in a questioning
text: glance to the cop, who shrugs.
dialog: 
text: Detective Peters comes over and sits down across from Lynn.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Don't you ever sleep?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: Not so much. You say you saw
dialog: someone outside?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
text: Yes. Right outside the glass when
dialog: I turned on the light.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: And was he black or white?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: He was a clown.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: A clown?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
text: There was a clown standing outside
dialog: your window at one a.m.?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: (knowing how it
dialog: sounds)
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: Was he lost? Wandered away from
dialog: Barnum & Bailey's and got trapped
dialog: in suburbia?
text: She says nothing, just glares back at him. He purses his lips
dialog: thoughtfully.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: This a P.R. stunt?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: (confused)
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: I know what you do, Miss Blodgett.
dialog: (off of her "so
dialog: what?" look)
dialog: You paint pictures. Of clowns.
dialog: This some kind of publicity stunt?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Does it look like a publicity
dialog: stunt?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: No. But looks can be deceiving.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: (getting mad)
dialog: That's great. How profound. I'd
dialog: like you to leave.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: No need to be rude.
dialog: 
text: The cop catches his eye.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COP
text: The house is all clear.
dialog: 
text: Peters nods.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: I'm just saying, if this is some
dialog: stunt, it's a serious crime to
dialog: call the police.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I didn't call the police.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: I know, I know. Your friend did.
dialog: The guy that owns a gallery full
dialog: of your clown paintings.
dialog: 
text: He stands up.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: I'll be talking to you soon. I've
dialog: got some other questions.

text: Lynn walks in, holding hands with her son NICHOLAS, aka
text: Nicky. He's about five years old.
dialog: 
text: Phillip, Amanda, and MR. PARRISH turn from one of Lynn's
text: paintings toward her. Mr. Parrish is a distinguished older

dialog: appear to need it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Hey...what's going on?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. PARRISH
dialog: Have you ever been spanked by a

dialog: 
text: Lynn doesn't know whether to laugh or be offended.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Excuse me?
dialog: 
text: Mr. Parrish hands her a photograph. In the photo is a clown
text: mugging for the camera with a bunch of kids at a birthday
dialog: party.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. PARRISH
dialog: My father. He used to be a clown
dialog: for neighborhood birthday parties.
dialog: A very strange thing. This man who
dialog: brings joy and smiles to everyone
text: around him...is also the man who
dialog: comes home and spanks you...hits
dialog: you with his hand or his belt. Not
dialog: happy to do it, mind you, but
dialog: doing his duty as a father
text: punishing a son.
dialog: 
text: Lynn's listening patiently, but can't see where he's going.
speaker_heading: MR. PARRISH
dialog: You paint magnificently. I don't
dialog: like the ones with the frightening
dialog: clowns though. I don't know why
dialog: you waste your time with those.
dialog: But the ones like this...
dialog: 
text: He points to the one they were all admiring when Lynn came
text: in. The clown in the painting gazes sadly on the wilted
text: flower in his hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. PARRISH
dialog: Incredible. Perfect. His
dialog: expression...I want you to capture
dialog: that for me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I'm sorry, Mr...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. PARRISH
text: Parrish. Endle Parrish.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I'm sorry, Mr. Parrish, I don't
dialog: know what you're talking about.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. PARRISH
dialog: I want you to paint a picture of
dialog: my father. I want you to show me
text: a clown saddened that he has to
text: spank his son.
dialog: 
text: Lynn's expression says it all. How strange. Lynn looks to
text: Phillip or Amanda for support. Neither says anything, but
text: they're smiling. Like something else is coming.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Mr. Parrish, I'm sorry but I don't
dialog: do commission pieces. I'm not even
dialog: sure I could--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. PARRISH
dialog: Ten thousand dollars. Cash if
dialog: you'd like.
dialog: 
text: She's speechless for a moment. Even Phillip and Amanda are
dialog: shocked. They knew the guy was loaded, but that's more than
dialog: even they expected.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I don't, I mean, I could sell you
dialog: that one for a lot less.
speaker_heading: MR. PARRISH
dialog: No. It has to look like my father.
dialog: I want an original painting of my
dialog: father and I need it in three days.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: That's just impossible. I can
dialog: recommend a number of excellent
dialog: painters--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. PARRISH
dialog: No. It must be you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I'm sorry, I can't do it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. PARRISH
dialog: Twenty thousand dollars. That's my
dialog: final offer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: You don't understand--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: Lynn, could we speak to you for a
dialog: moment?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: (to Amanda regarding
dialog: Nick)
dialog: Can you keep an eye on him?
dialog: 
text: Amanda nods. Nicky's happy playing with his action figures on
text: a bench.
dialog: 
text: Phillip pulls her into the other room, leaving Mr. Parrish to
text: gaze at her paintings.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I can't, Phillip. I don't have the
dialog: time right now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: Make the time. You can't be too
dialog: busy for that kind of money.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I am. I'm getting divorced. That's
dialog: why I'm going to move. Get away,
dialog: get a new start.
dialog: 
text: He doesn't act surprised. Either that, or he doesn't think it
dialog: matters.
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: You've got to think this through,
dialog: Lynn. Can you imagine what this is
dialog: going to do for your other
dialog: paintings? For your reputation?
text: Once people hear Mr. Parrish paid
dialog: twenty thousand for one of your
dialog: paintings, it will open the flood
dialog: gates. You won't be consigned to
dialog: showing your paintings in my
dialog: gallery...you'll be all over the
dialog: country.
dialog: 
text: Lynn's starting to see the picture.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I'm not sure I can do it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: Of course you can.
dialog: 
text: She's not so sure. She gives him one more unsure look before
text: going back into the other room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. PARRISH
dialog: You'll do it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I can't promise you I'll get it
dialog: done.
dialog: 
text: He ignores her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. PARRISH
dialog: (handing her the
dialog: photo again)
dialog: Excellent. My phone number is on
dialog: the back. Call me when you've
dialog: finished and let me know how you'd
dialog: like the payment.
dialog: 
text: She takes it. Mr. Parrish hangs the cane on the crook of his
text: arm, and if he had a hat, he'd probably doff it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. PARRISH
dialog: Good day.
dialog: 
text: He swaggers out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMANDA
dialog: (in awe)
dialog: Twenty thousand dollars...that'll
dialog: buy a lot of bandwidth.
text: Neither Phillip nor Lynn know what she's talking about.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMANDA
dialog: Tres geek, huh?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: What happened last night? I called
dialog: the police but wouldn't tell me
dialog: anything.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I'm sorry. I don't even know where
dialog: to start.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMANDA
dialog: (totally in the dark)
dialog: What? What happened?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: You'll never believe it...get me
dialog: some coffee and I'll tell you
dialog: about it.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BASEMENT - DAY
dialog: 
text: The backyard of a run-down house. Concrete stairs lead down
text: the back to a basement door.
dialog: 
text: A noise. Like a MUFFLED SHOUT followed by a dull THWACK. It's
text: coming from inside the house.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT
dialog: 
text: The basement is dark and bare, undecorated cinderblock walls.
text: The concrete floor is uncarpeted. A thin mattress sits in the
text: corner surrounded by opened soda cans and other trash. The
text: windows are covered so that the only light is from a bulb in
text: the ceiling.
dialog: 
text: A simple wooden table stands in the center of the room, an
text: answering machine sitting on top of it. Next to the table is
text: a wooden stump.
dialog: 
text: The clown, breathing heavily, holds an axe.
dialog: 
text: No warning. He swings the axe into the stump as hard as he
text: can, YELLING like a savage.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOWN
text: GEEEEEEEEEEEEHHHHHT!
text: He pulls the axe out, mumbling as he exhales from the effort.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOWN
dialog: --better.
dialog: 
text: Again he swings the axe, again the YELL.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOWN
dialog: GET!
dialog: 
text: Pulls it out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOWN
dialog: Better.
dialog: 
text: Over and over again, reciting the litany, a cruel smile on
text: his face.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GALLERY - LATER
dialog: 
text: Lynn and her friends have retired to the more comfortable
text: reception area. Nick has his action figures battling
text: underneath the magazine table.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: The police took our statements,
dialog: but it didn't seem like they
dialog: thought they'd catch him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMANDA
dialog: That's a really nice area. I can't
dialog: believe someone mugged you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: What happened when I called you?
dialog: 
text: Lynn has an internal debate. She decides to spare herself the
dialog: embarrassment of the clown story.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I don't know. I guess it all just
dialog: caught up to me. I must have
text: passed out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMANDA
dialog: You passed out? What's that like?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: It felt a lot like hitting the
dialog: floor.
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: You need to take it easy, Lynn.
dialog: And I don't think that includes
text: leaving with strange men at night.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Is that you, dad?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMANDA
dialog: He's right. You should stay away
dialog: from that guy.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Give me his phone number and I'll
dialog: pass him the message.
dialog: 
text: Lynn smirks at her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Anyway. I have to get going to the
dialog: mediation. You're sure you're all
dialog: right with watching Nicky for an
dialog: hour?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMANDA
dialog: Not a problem. I don't have class
dialog: until four.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Great. Thanks a lot.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMANDA
dialog: Don't thank me. I'm billing you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: What exactly is supposed to happen
dialog: at this mediation?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: I'm not sure. I think we have to
dialog: sit down and decide who gets what,
dialog: and what his visitation rights are
dialog: going to be.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MEDIATION ROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: A sterile meeting room with a lacquered table and office
text: chairs. There's a sweating metal pitcher of water at the
text: center of the table.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Are you out of your fucking mind?
text: Lynn and her lawyer MARTY are on one side, Bert and his
text: lawyer OSBOURNE across from them. The MEDIATOR, a man with a
text: wooden face, sits at the head of the table.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MEDIATOR
dialog: Mind the language please.
dialog: 
text: Osbourne's a no-nonsense older man and looks like he's
dialog: accustomed to taking apart multi-million dollar corporations
dialog: before breakfast.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE
dialog: That's what we want. Sole custody
dialog: of Nicholas. Half of the ownership
dialog: of every painting you've created
dialog: since you married, or half the
dialog: price if you've sold them already.
dialog: You can keep your car. Bert won't
dialog: ask for any palimony, but you'll
dialog: have to pay child support.
dialog: 
text: Lynn looks at Marty in disbelief, then back at Bert.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: You can kiss my ass.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MEDIATOR
dialog: Miss Blodgett, that's not helpful.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE
dialog: And please direct your comments to
dialog: me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Why? Is he too chickenshit to talk
dialog: to me?
dialog: (shakes her head)
dialog: I can't believe I'm hearing this.
dialog: Marty?
dialog: 
dialog: Marty seems like more of your public defender type attorney.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: That's not going to fly, guys.
text: Lynn gets sole custody. Full
dialog: alimony and child support. Bert
dialog: can keep his house--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE
dialog: The house was his before the
dialog: marriage. It's not in her name at
dialog: all. Our terms aren't negotiable,
dialog: Marty.
dialog: Your client has no home--very
dialog: unstable for the child. If she
dialog: tries to buy one before the
dialog: divorce goes through, we'll pursue
dialog: half of it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: (to Bert)
dialog: Oh my God...
dialog: 
text: Osbourne tries a sympathetic smile and fails.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE
dialog: (to Marty)
dialog: You don't want to play hardball
dialog: with me. I'm short stop in the
dialog: majors, and you couldn't play
text: outfield in the minors.
dialog: 
text: Marty knows he's outclassed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: We just want a fair deal,
dialog: Osbourne. That's all we're looking
dialog: for.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE
dialog: We're offering you a fair deal.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: He wants her to pay child
dialog: support? He's a doctor, for
dialog: godsakes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE
dialog: He's been unemployed for over six
dialog: months.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: What? What's he been doing?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE
dialog: It's not your business.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: It's not my business? He's still
dialog: my husband, you son of a bitch.
dialog: Where has he been going everyday?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MEDIATOR
dialog: Please, Miss--
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: No! I want an answer. Where the
dialog: hell has my husband been going
dialog: every day for the past six months
dialog: if he wasn't going to work?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MEDIATOR
dialog: Okay, let's call it a day.
dialog: 
text: Lynn slams her hand on the table.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Bullshit!
dialog: 
text: Marty touches her arm and raises his eyebrows to let her know
text: she's getting out of line. She takes a moment to calm down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MEDIATOR
dialog: Let's meet Monday after everyone's
dialog: had a chance to cool down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: (before Lynn can
dialog: speak)
dialog: Sounds good.
dialog: 
text: He reaches across to shake Osbourne's hand, but Osbourne only
text: nods and begins packing his papers into his briefcase.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE
dialog: I'll fax our terms to your office.
dialog: You do have a fax machine?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Of course.
dialog: 
text: Osbourne nods and guides Bert out of the office. Neither meet
text: Lynn's smoldering gaze.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: You really stuck it to him, Marty.
dialog: 
text: He's surprised by her attack.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: What? What do you mean?
dialog: 
text: Lynn doesn't respond. She fights back tears.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I'm not losing Nicholas. I can't
dialog: lose him.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: It'll be all right. We'll get him.
dialog: 
text: She doesn't look reassured.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT - DAY
dialog: 
text: It's the dark basement again. Same table. Same answering
text: machine on the table, but the red light is blinking now.
dialog: 
text: The clown stands in front of the table staring at the light.
text: The red casts a dull reflection in his black eyes.
dialog: 
text: He pushes the button. The voice that issues from the machine
text: is deep and electronically altered.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE (FROM MACHINE)
dialog: You want to get better, don't you?
dialog: 
text: The clown nods imperceptibly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE (FROM MACHINE)
dialog: You are getting better. Not much
dialog: longer and you'll be cured. But
dialog: first...take the van.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOWN
dialog: The murder van...
dialog: 
text: There's a pause as the voice seems to consider this. Is it an
dialog: answering machine or some kind of intercom?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE (FROM MACHINE)
dialog: Do not kill her. Follow her.
dialog: Frighten her. Make her doubt her
dialog: own sanity. But do not harm
dialog: her...yet. Let no one else see
dialog: you. Go.
dialog: 
text: The clown turns and leaves.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Lynn walks in, her cel phone to her ear.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I'm not kidding you. He's going
dialog: for full custody, Julie. He wants
dialog: me to pay him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE (PHONE)
dialog: That bastard.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: God, I feel like I'm having a
dialog: nervous breakdown. I'm telling
dialog: you...there was a clown outside my
dialog: door last night.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE (PHONE)
dialog: You said that. You were probably
text: just exhausted.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I feel like I'm living in a
dialog: nightmare, Julie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE (PHONE)
dialog: Just take some deep breaths. So
dialog: what are you going to do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I'm going to paint that picture
dialog: for Mr. Parrish. Then I'm going to
dialog: use that money to hire the best
dialog: attorney in town to kick his
dialog: lawyer's ass!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE (PHONE)
dialog: That a girl!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Hey, I got someone calling on the
dialog: other line, could be my lawyer.
dialog: Can I call you back later?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE (PHONE)
dialog: Sure thing. Talk to you soon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Bye.
dialog: (clicks a button)
dialog: Hello?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK (PHONE)
dialog: Lynn. It's Tuck.
dialog: 
text: Lynn smiles. Even with the events of the day, Tuck can bring
text: a smile to her face. She's got it bad for him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Hi. How are you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK (PHONE)
dialog: I was gonna ask you the same thing.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I'm okay. I mean, about last
dialog: night. It's just, well there's
dialog: other stuff--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK (PHONE)
dialog: Wanna go get a bite to eat?
dialog: 
text: She's tempted, but there's so much to do.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I'd like to, but--
dialog: 
text: There's a KNOCK on the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Hold on a minute.
dialog: 
text: She goes to the door and opens it. Tuck's standing there, his
text: cel phone to his ear. He's got his mischievous smile in place.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Hey Lynn, can I call you back?
dialog: 
text: Lynn smiles and plays his game.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Sure.
dialog: 
text: They both hang up. Lynn opens the screen door for him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: So I was thinking...the circus is
dialog: in town and if you wanted to go
dialog: see some friendly clowns for
dialog: once...
dialog: 
dialog: That idea doesn't thrill Lynn.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I don't think so.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Why are you so afraid of clowns?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I'm not afraid of them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: You are too.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I am not. Just because I paint
dialog: them--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Just because you paint scary
text: clowns. Only scary clowns.
dialog: 
text: Lynn walks away, picks her mail off the table and busies
text: herself sorting it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: That doesn't mean I'm scared of
dialog: them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: What does it mean then?
dialog: 
text: That stumps Lynn.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: It's okay. There's even a word for
dialog: it. Coulrophobia.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Coulrophobia?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Fear of clowns. Lot of people have
dialog: it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Really?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: I'm not smart enough to make up a
dialog: word like that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: So what are you afraid of?
dialog: 
text: He takes a moment. A playful smile on his face. Weighing the
dialog: moment; to tell the truth or lie?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
text: Silence. Being alone.
dialog: 
text: He's still smiling. But something in his eyes is daring her
dialog: to understand his words.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Lots of people feel that way. So
dialog: how could you possibly be alone?
text: He doesn't answer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Want to do something strange?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: That's a loaded question.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: You like to take pictures?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Sure. I do a lot of photo-
dialog: referencing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Grab your camera. Come on.
dialog: 
text: Again, she knows she shouldn't be doing it. There's something
text: about him that draws her though. Like a moth to the flame.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Okay. Just let me call Amanda
dialog: first...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE
dialog: 
text: Today, Tuck has his motorcycle, a sleek black machine that
text: looks built for speed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: On that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Perfectly safe.
dialog: 
text: He hands her a helmet. He hops on and helps her mount the
text: bike behind him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Hold on.
dialog: 
text: He starts the motorcycle and ROARS off, Lynn gripping him
text: tightly around the waist.
dialog: 
text: Behind them, a van with tinted-black windows starts up and
text: pulls out.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - DAY
dialog: 
text: Tuck pulls his cycle into a cul-de-sac off of the main road.
text: A high fence runs the entire length of the road, but there's
text: a hole in it where it curves for the cul-de-sac.
text: He helps Lynn off and stacks the helmets on the back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Come on.
dialog: 
text: He leads her to the hole and helps her climb through.
dialog: 
text: Once through, they're in a wooded area. Lots of trees and ivy
text: and overgrowth.
dialog: 
text: Tuck takes her hand and leads her.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. LAND OF MYTH
dialog: 
text: They emerge from the woods into a huge clear area. Everywhere
dialog: you look is the remnants of what used to be a theme park
dialog: devoted to fairy tales.
dialog: 
text: A plastic statue of Jack(no sign of Jill) lies on the ground
text: covered by weeds. A tall beanstalk like the one Jack might
text: have climbed(had his been made of metal) creeps up to the sky
text: but doesn't go as far as it used to. A castle that was once
text: pristine is falling to ruin and ivy threatens to pull down
text: its every wall.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Where are we?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: It was called The Land Of Myth.
dialog: They closed it down about fifteen
dialog: years ago.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Oh my God...I've been here. As a
dialog: kid.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Me too. It was popular for a while.
dialog: 
text: As they talk, they're walking through what's left of the
text: displays. Lynn begins taking pictures.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Kind of creepy now, isn't it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Tell you the truth, I thought it
dialog: was kind of creepy back then.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: You did?
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Something about it gave me the
dialog: willies. But now, to see it like
dialog: this...why did they leave
dialog: everything here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Don't know. Maybe it was hard to
dialog: move. Maybe no one wanted it.
dialog: 
text: She keeps snapping pics.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: We'll have to compare pictures
dialog: sometime.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: You take pictures?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Yep. I took a lot of photography
dialog: classes in college.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I wish I'd brought some black and
dialog: white film.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: It's okay, you can make them black
text: and white with a computer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Really?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Sure. You can do just about
dialog: anything with a computer.
dialog: 
text: There is movement behind them as the clown peers from around
text: one of the exhibits.
dialog: 
text: Lynn says nothing. She's mulling over something in her mind.
text: Tuck senses it and gives her time, just keeps checking out
dialog: all the relics.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Listen. I have to level with you.
dialog: My life is kind of a train wreck
dialog: right now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Well...what are we doing?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: Getting to know each other.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Why?
dialog: 
dialog: Tuck's playing stupid.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: What do you mean, why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Come on. I'm attracted to you and
dialog: I think you're attracted to me.
dialog: But this is...it's just a bad time.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: (playing stupid)
dialog: You're attracted to me?
dialog: 
text: Lynn stops walking and smirks at him until he gives.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Okay okay. So we're past the
dialog: subtext. What's the problem?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: It's really complicated.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: You said that already. You're
dialog: getting divorced. What's
dialog: complicated?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: You asked for it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Give it to me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOWN POV

dialog: 
speaker_heading: RESUME
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: --and he's trying to take my son
dialog: away from me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Why is the house still in his ex-
dialog: wife's name? How long's it been
dialog: since he was married to her?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Ten years.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: That's...strange.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: That's not even the half of it.
dialog: Now I find out that he hasn't been
dialog: working for the better part of a
dialog: year. He'd leave the house
dialog: everyday, but where he went...?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Jesus.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: See, I have a lot of stuff to work
dialog: out before I can even...you know.
dialog: 
text: Tuck only smiles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I should have known, I mean he's
text: a man with a cat. Single men with
dialog: cats are bad news. At least,
dialog: that's what the magazines say.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Did you get enough pictures?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Ready to go?
dialog: 
text: He nods. They head back the way they came, not seeing the
text: clown as he circles around a structure to keep out of their
text: sight. At one point, he's close enough to reach out and touch
dialog: them.
dialog: 
text: BACK AT THE MOTORCYCLE
dialog: 
text: Lynn climbs on back as Tuck pulls on his driving gloves. He
text: straightens the motorcycle, and in the side mirror the clown
text: ducks back into the bushes.
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Ready?
dialog: 
text: She grabs him around the stomach.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
text: He takes off.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE - LATER
dialog: 
text: Tuck pulls his cycle up to the curb and turns it off. She
text: hops off just as Detective Peters gets out of his car across
text: the street. He looks like he's been waiting for a while.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: Miss Blodgett?
dialog: 
text: Lynn turns and sees him. Tuck does too, and something passes
text: across his face. He can tell Peters is a cop, and there's
text: instant friction. Like two alpha males trying to stake out
dialog: their territory.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: How you doing?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Fine.
dialog: 
text: There's the briefest moment where the detective waits for
text: Lynn to introduce him to Tuck. She doesn't, so he takes the
dialog: initiative.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
text: Detective Peters, homicide.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Homicide?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: Yeah, that's when somebody dies.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: (no shit)
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: There was a murder yesterday a few
text: doors down.
dialog: (looks to Lynn then
dialog: back to Tuck)
text: Now Miss Blodgett is seeing clowns
text: in her backyard.
dialog: 
text: Tuck shoots Lynn a questioning look. She rolls her eyes, like
text: she's tired of this guy. Tuck turns his attention back to
dialog: Peters.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
text: Takes a clown to catch a clown,
dialog: huh?
dialog: 
text: He laughs like he's kidding, but Peters gets the jibe. He
text: gives a little laugh, makes a show of examining Tuck's
dialog: motorcycle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: You know what us cops call these?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: A donorcycle. Whenever there's an
dialog: accident with one of them, we pick
dialog: up the rider and his brain's all
text: scrambled but the rest of him is
dialog: A-okay. Perfect organ donor.
dialog: 
text: Tuck's not impressed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: You know what we call cops where
dialog: I come from?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: No, what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: We don't.
dialog: 
text: He kick-starts the motorcycle and drives off, giving a wink
dialog: to Lynn.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: Who's your friend?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Can I help you with something?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: I don't know yet.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Why are you here then?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: I'm a detective. I'm...detecting.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: (tiring of it)
dialog: And what are you detecting?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: ...I've got a funny feeling about
dialog: you, Miss Blodgett.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Well. Try and keep it in your
dialog: pants, would you?
dialog: 
text: She turns on her heel and heads to her door. The detective
text: watches her ass the entire way but makes no attempt to follow.

scene_heading: INT. HOUSE - EVENING
dialog:

scene_heading: INT. HOUSE - LATER
dialog: 
text: Lynn's got about ten pages of sketches next to her. Outside
text: her window, night has fallen.
dialog: 
text: But the sketch she's working on now is different. She's got
text: colored pencils and charcoal, and is pencilling the clown she
text: seems to be obsessed with.
dialog: 
text: Except now his eyes are exactly like the one she saw outside
text: her sliding-glass door the previous night. Black, reflecting
text: a pinprick of light.
text: She stops and takes a good look at her handiwork. Then
text: realizes that she's put off her paying project to do more
text: sketches of her obsession.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: For God's sake...
dialog: 
text: She pushes it to the side and begins setting up her easel to
dialog: paint.

scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:

scene_heading: INT. AMANDA'S HOUSE -SAME TIME
dialog: 
text: Amanda scrolls down, clicks. A new page pops up. Amanda

dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMANDA
dialog: Woah.
dialog: 
text: She reads some more, scrolls down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMANDA
dialog: Woah.
dialog: 
text: She grabs the phone, casting a glance at the clock. Ten
text: forty. Might be a little late with Lynn having Nicky.
text: Disappointed, she hangs up the phone.
dialog: 
text: With a click of the mouse, she opens up her email and begins
text: writing. Just a quick note. She clicks SEND.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE - SAME TIME
dialog: 
text: Lynn paints. Broad strokes, getting a feel for the paper, for
dialog: the piece.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICHOLAS (O.S.)
dialog: Mom-meeeeee!
dialog: 
text: She's instantly broken out of her artist trance. She rushes
text: up the stairs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: You thirsty, Nicky?
dialog: 
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. AMANDA'S HOUSE/BATHROOM -SAME TIME
dialog: 
text: The bathroom is steamy as Amanda steps out, one towel around
text: her body as she uses another to dry her hair.
text: She moves into her bedroom. The head towel gets tossed onto
text: the bed. She begins blow-drying her hair with the electric
text: hair dryer on her dresser.
dialog: 
text: Casually. No hurry. She spares a glance at herself in the
text: mirror as she blows her hair back. She notices the curtains
text: of her room move gently in the breeze behind her.
dialog: 
text: She frowns and switches off the dryer. She goes to the
text: window. She has to climb onto the bed to get to it, and
text: immediately there's a slight TINKLING of glass.
dialog: 
text: Behind the bed lies broken glass. There doesn't seem to be
text: any of it on the bedsheet.
dialog: 
text: Amanda frowns even more. What the--?
dialog: 
text: She pushes the curtain out of the way. There's a hole in her
text: window about the size of a baseball. Or a fist.
dialog: 
text: For a moment it really doesn't bother her. Some kid must have
text: thrown something through her window.
dialog: 
text: Then she sees her window screen lying in the grass outside,
text: partially bent. She pushes curtains aside to look at the top
text: of the window. It's unlocked.
dialog: 
text: Her eyes go wide. She's frightened but not the kind prone to
text: panic. She goes for the portable phone by her bed...it's not
text: there. Just an empty cradle.
dialog: 
text: She curses almost silently. Where did she put it?
dialog: 
text: She takes a quick look around her bedroom but doesn't see it.
text: Looking at the doorway leading into the dark hallway, she
text: seems to have a hard time swallowing.
dialog: 
text: She creeps to the doorway and listens for the sounds of an
text: intruder.
dialog: 
text: Silence. For one moment she's in indecision. Maybe it's
dialog: nothing(she forgot to lock the window), could have been a
dialog: baseball. If someone broke into her house he would have fled
dialog: when he heard someone was home...
dialog: 
text: INTO THE HALLWAY
dialog: 
text: she moves slowly, one hand held to the towel around her body.
text: She passes the living room(no one there) and gets to the
text: kitchen. She quickly moves to the wall. Stops.
dialog: 
text: Another empty cradle. No phone.
text: That's strange. That's wrong. Sensing something in her
text: peripheral vision she turns her head slightly.
dialog: 
text: The clown stands in the opening between the kitchen and
dialog: dining room.
dialog: 
text: Amanda's startled, but only for a moment. And then, rather
text: then being scared, she scoffs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMANDA
dialog: What the hell are you supposed to
dialog: be?
dialog: 
text: The axe, which had been hanging out of sight by his leg,
text: THWACKS into the kitchen wall.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOWN
dialog: Better.
dialog: 
text: That does it. Amanda runs for the front door. The clown
text: doesn't bother pulling his axe out of the wall. He moves
text: quickly around the other side, intercepting her before she
text: gets to the door.
dialog: 
text: He grabs for her--only gets the towel--it comes loose. A now
text: naked Amanda stumbles as the towel is jerked from her. The
text: clown tosses it to the side and grabs her by the hair before
text: she can scramble more than a few feet.
dialog: 
text: He drags her struggling form back into the kitchen. He grabs
text: her by the neck and SLAMS her back into the wall so her feet
text: aren't touching the ground anymore.
dialog: 
text: She's choking. Has to use both hands to keep from suffocating
dialog: completely.
dialog: 
text: The clown is suddenly aware of her nakedness. He runs a
text: finger down from her shoulder to the curve of her breast. He
text: studies her like he's never seen a naked women before.
dialog: 
text: She makes a desperate grab at his face, raking her nails down
text: one side of his cheek. The gashes aren't deep, but they take
text: off some of his paint. He SLAMS her head against the wall.
dialog: 
text: Casually he tosses her to the floor.
dialog: 
text: She's choking, trying to get her air back. Weakly crawling
text: backward away from him.
dialog: 
text: He wrenches the axe from the wall.
dialog: 
text: She tries to beg--can't talk, her larynx is crushed--puts an
dialog: arm up.
text: The clown takes a two handed grip on the axe. Getting ready
dialog: to chop wood.
dialog: 
text: He swings.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE - LATER
dialog: 
text: Lynn's finished a painting. Very nice, but not as clean as
text: her paintings on display. And it's missing something...some
text: emotion. She's looking at the photo closely then looking back
text: at the picture.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: What are you missing...?
dialog: 
text: She can't figure it out and she's too tired to try. She
text: covers the painting and goes to bed.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:

scene_heading: INT. HOUSE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Lynn enters from the front door. The PHONE IS RINGING. She
text: rushes to get it, leaving the front door open.
dialog: 
text: The phone stops ringing the moment her hand touches it. She
text: curses silently.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK (O.S.)
dialog: Knock knock.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Hi.
dialog: 
text: Tuck's standing right outside her screen door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: You're probably getting sick of
dialog: me, aren't you?
dialog: 
text: Lynn pretends like she is, gives him a sympathetic smile.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Now that you mention it...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: I called earlier...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I was dropping Nicky off with his
dialog: father.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Oh. Well, did you want to do lunch?
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Where?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: At La Casa Tucker.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I should be painting...and do you
dialog: really have a job?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Come on. Best food in the state.
dialog: 
text: Indecision again. Again, what she wants to do beats out what
dialog: she should do.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: All right. I can spare an hour or
dialog: so.
dialog: 
text: He gives her his winningest smile.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Excellent.

scene_heading: EXT. TUCK'S HOUSE - LATER
dialog:

text: house is huge. Tuck gets off his cycle and leads her into the
dialog: house.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TUCK'S HOUSE
dialog: 
text: Lynn follows him in and WHISTLES appreciatively. Two spiral
text: staircases run on both sides of the foyer to the second

speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: (trying to be modest)
dialog: I got a good deal.

speaker_heading: LYNN

speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Is your maid going to cook it?
dialog: 
text: He flashes a reproachful smile.
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: I don't have a maid.
dialog: 
text: An orange cat strolls out from a side room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Hey Tiggs, we have a guest.
dialog: 
text: Lynn sees the cat, sees Tuck squat down to pet it, and she
text: smiles sardonically as she remembers what she said about men
dialog: and cats.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Do you have a bathroom? I have to
text: pull my foot out of my mouth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK

speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Surprise me.

scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE - SAME TIME

speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: For this piece, I'm getting twenty
dialog: thousand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Ha! I told you that painting I

dialog: 
dialog: Lynn's been flipping through occasional books. Tuck's
text: interests are wide-ranging. There are a bunch of art books.
text: On a lower shelf sits a stack of magazines. Lynn sees one she
text: recognizes and pulls it out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: We'll see. I'm really not sure I
dialog: can do what the guy is asking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: What's he asking?
dialog: 
text: Lynn flips through the magazine called "MODERN PAINTER" and
text: sees a page which has been bent in to save the place.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
text: A picture of his father.
dialog: 
text: The page opens to reveal a large photo of Lynn, followed by
text: an article about her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Doesn't sound that tough.
dialog: 
text: Lynn frowns. She was under the impression that Tuck knew
dialog: nothing about her when they met.
text: She flips to the front and notes that the magazine is months
text: old and has a subscription label on it with Tuck's name and
dialog: address. Not a recent buy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: His father was a clown and he
dialog: wants him to look a certain way.
dialog: 
text: She grabs another magazine out of the stack. One called "ART
text: GALLERY". There are two pages folded in. The first is a
text: painting of hers with its name(MARY'S CLOWN) and her name
text: under it. The second page shows a picture of her with a short
text: biography next to it.
dialog: 
text: Now she's alarmed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: I meant to ask you. You think it's
dialog: strange that guy tried to mug us
text: with a knife when he's got a gun
dialog: in his coat?
dialog: 
dialog: She's doesn't want to panic. Ask him about it? Was their
text: meeting just a chance thing, or has he been...stalking her?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Maybe it wasn't loaded.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: We wouldn't have known that--
dialog: 
text: He's interrupted by THE DOORBELL. Lynn hastily drops the Art

speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: What's going on?

speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: You want to step out of the way?

dialog: mean, it's not just that. We don't
dialog: have the coroner's report yet, but
dialog: I'd bet my shield that...
text: (licks his lips,
dialog: probably shouldn't
dialog: say anything)
dialog: ...well, I think the person that
dialog: killed your friend is the same
dialog: person that killed the family
dialog: three doors down from you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: What?
dialog: 
text: She's having a hard time dealing with it. Any of it.
text: Amanda...dead, killed...same as the neighbors...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: I don't think it's a coincidence.
dialog: I think someone is zeroing in on
dialog: you.
dialog: 
text: Lynn's too surprised to speak.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: I've already said more than I
dialog: should. But there's more. I need
dialog: to know I have your complete
dialog: confidence, that you won't repeat
dialog: what I'm about to tell you. To
dialog: anyone.
dialog: 
text: She nods, afraid to trust her voice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: Amanda fought back against the
dialog: person. We've recovered blood and
text: tissue from under her fingernails.
dialog: And...grease paint.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Paint?
dialog: 
text: She's glancing at her paints next to her easel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: Grease paint. Like you'd buy in
dialog: any Halloween or costume shop.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I'm sorry, I just, I don't
dialog: understand.
text: Peters take a photo out of his jacket pocket, not showing it
dialog: to her yet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: The window that he entered from...
dialog: 
text: He's not sure how to say it...he shrugs and hands her the
dialog: photo.
dialog: 
text: She looks at it, not comprehending what she's looking at. A
text: window with a hole in it. But below that, smudged white and
text: a red dot centered below it. Then it hits her. Her eyes widen
text: in shock.
dialog: 
text: She stands up and moves to her sketch pad. She flips it open
text: to the clown--her clown--that she drew the night before. She
text: holds the picture next to the sketch.
dialog: 
text: It's pretty obvious that if her clown were real, and he
text: pushed his face against a window, it would leave those marks.
text: White forehead, red nose. Evil. Peering in Amanda's window.
text: Just like he peered in her window.
dialog: 
text: She holds the sketch and the photo out to Peters. He takes
dialog: them, but it's like he already thought.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: I admit that I didn't take you
dialog: seriously with your clown story
dialog: the other night.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: To tell you the truth...I'd
dialog: convinced myself it was some
dialog: hallucination, or shock from being
text: mugged.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: Well, you have my assurance that
dialog: I'm taking you deadly serious now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: This what he looked like when you
dialog: saw him?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: His eyes are black like that?
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: Huh. Can I have this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
text: He stands, starts backing his way to the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: Whoever this guy is...we'll get
dialog: him. You need to watch yourself
dialog: until we do though. I'll have
dialog: someone out in front of your house
dialog: at all times.
dialog: 
text: Lynn stays strong, nods.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: I'll call you if I come up with
dialog: anything.
dialog: 
text: Once he's gone though, the tears flow. She weeps almost
text: silently for her friend.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY
dialog: 
text: A car is parked under the shade of a tree. Bert's SAAB pulls
text: in next to it, but during the conversation, the person in the
text: other car can't be seen.
dialog: 
text: Bert rolls his window down. He tries to act like he's
text: watching something in front of him while he talks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: What the hell is taking so long?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HESTON
dialog: You don't want to take that tone
dialog: with me.
dialog: 
text: The man's got a dangerous voice. Bert backs off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: It was--you were supposed to have
dialog: done it by now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HESTON
dialog: Clearly, there's been a problem.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: And what is that?
speaker_heading: HESTON
dialog: First, the guy she's been hanging
dialog: out with. I could go around that.
dialog: Other problem, well, it's a clown.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HESTON
text: There's a clown been following her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: A clown?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HESTON
dialog: For a shrink you don't hear so
dialog: good.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Tell me about this...clown.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HESTON
dialog: Only saw him once. Your wife and
text: her new beau went sightseeing at
text: an abandoned amusement park. The
dialog: clown followed them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: What did he look like?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HESTON
text: He looked like a clown. Face
dialog: paint. Frizzy thing around the
dialog: neck.
dialog: 
text: Bert knows something. He stares forward for a moment,
text: debating, but doesn't address it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: So what's the problem?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HESTON
dialog: People are getting killed all
dialog: around your soon-to-be-ex. The
text: cops are swarming.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: What are you talking about?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HESTON
text: A family, couple doors down. Then
text: last night, a girl that works for
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Amanda?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HESTON
dialog: Whatever. My source in the
dialog: department says they got grease
text: paint off the window the perp came
dialog: in.
dialog: (on Bert's clueless
dialog: look)
dialog: Like clown makeup. This is gonna
dialog: take more money.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: I don't think so.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HESTON
dialog: Your choice. I'll just take what
dialog: you've given me as a deposit for
dialog: services rendered. Have a nice
dialog: life.
dialog: 
text: His car starts.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Wait! How much more?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HESTON
dialog: Hmmmm...psychotic clowns, cops
text: galore. Another ten.
dialog: 
text: Bert winces. He's not happy about it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: All right, but that's it. I can't
dialog: pay you any more.
dialog: 
text: WE COME AROUND SO WE FINALLY SEE HESTON
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HESTON
dialog: The whole make-it-look-like-a-
dialog: mugging is out. Get your alibi
dialog: ready, doc. They're gonna question
dialog: you.
dialog: 
text: Heston is the "mugger" who tried to rob Lynn and Tuck.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HESTON
dialog: I'll do it when the money's
dialog: transferred. She's as good as dead.
dialog: 
text: His car pulls away. Bert watches him drive off, but his mind
text: is on something else. Something nagging at his brain like a
dialog: name on the tip of your tongue.
scene_heading: INT. GALLERY - LATER
dialog: 
text: Lynn enters. All the make up in the world can't disguise the
text: fact that she's been crying.
dialog: 
text: Phillip's at the front desk doing paperwork. He sees her and
text: rushes over.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: Oh Lynn, I'm so sorry.
dialog: 
text: He hugs her. She takes a couple of deep breaths, fights off
text: the urge to cry again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I'm okay.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: You sure?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: (wan smile)
dialog: Yeah. When did you find out?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: About an hour ago. Some detective
dialog: came by to ask questions.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Detective Peters?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: Yes. That was him.
dialog: 
text: She shakes her head at his persistance.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: (kidding)
dialog: I think he's been following me.
dialog: 
text: Phillip's concerned.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: Why would a detective be following
dialog: you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I was joking. At least, a little.
text: He seems to pop up all the time.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: That's strange...Oh, hey.
dialog: 
text: He retrieves some papers from behind the counter.
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: I didn't show this to the
dialog: detective. I hope I won't get in
dialog: any trouble.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: What is it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: Amanda sent us all an email last
dialog: night.
dialog: 
text: Lynn looks at it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: It's about Mr. Parrish. His father
dialog: wasn't just a clown; he was a
dialog: convicted child molester. One of
dialog: the children disappeared, but they
dialog: could never prove he had anything
dialog: to do with it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Oh my God...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
text: The second page has some pictures.
dialog: 
text: Lynn looks. The pictures are from the trial. One picture in
text: particular sticks out: Mr. Parrish's father sitting behind
text: the defendant's desk with a deep look of remorse on his face.
dialog: 
text: Feeling overwhelmed, Lynn backs herself onto a bench.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: I'm sorry, I should have waited to
dialog: show you--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: No, it's all right Phillip. I have
dialog: to give this to the police. Amanda
dialog: sent this to us last night
dialog: sometime before...
dialog: (can't bring herself
dialog: to say it)
dialog: I have to give this to the
dialog: detective.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: If you don't want to paint for
dialog: him, I understand.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I have to. I need the money.
dialog: (off his look)
dialog: I have to get a new lawyer. Bert's
dialog: trying to take Nicky away from me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: He can't do that...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: He can.
dialog: (overwhelmed)
dialog: I just don't feel like I could
dialog: paint anything right now. I've got
dialog: cops in front of my house--
dialog: 
text: The PHONE RINGING interrupts her. Phillip answers it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: Flinner Gallery. Oh, hello Mr.
dialog: Flynn...
dialog: 
text: Lynn shakes her head: She's not here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: No, I haven't seen her today.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'll tell her you called when I
dialog: see her. Bye bye.
dialog: 
text: He hangs up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: What's that all about?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: (doesn't feel like
dialog: going into it)
dialog: I don't feel like talking to
dialog: anyone right now.
dialog: (occurs to her)
dialog: Hey, did he ever buy anything from
dialog: the gallery before?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: Well...I don't think so.
dialog: 
text: Her cel phone picks that moment to RING. She looks at the
text: number: it's Tuck. She doesn't want to talk to him, but she
text: doesn't want her phone to keep ringing.
dialog: 
text: She puts up a finger to Phillip to give her a minute, and she
text: moves off to talk.
scene_heading: INTERCUT LYNN/TUCK
dialog: 
text: Tuck's leaning against his car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Hello.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Hey, there you are. I tried to
dialog: reach you at home and at the
dialog: gallery.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Yeah, I'm running around...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: So, is everything okay? What did
dialog: that detective want?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Amanda, my assistant...she was
dialog: murdered last night.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: ...what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
text: Someone attacked her in her house.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: My God...Did they catch whoever
dialog: did it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Is there anything I can do? Do you
dialog: need anything?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: No. No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Jesus. Why would anyone do that?
dialog: Do you want me to come by--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: No, it's...listen Tuck.
dialog: (deep breath)
dialog: I think we uh, I need some time to
dialog: deal with all this...alone?
dialog: 
text: He's disappointed, but hides it in his voice.
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Sure, I understand. I'm here for
dialog: you, okay?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: You watch yourself, huh? Where are
dialog: you now?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I'm...outside the police station.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Okay. Give me a call if you need
dialog: anything. Anything at all.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Okay. I'll talk to you soon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Okay. Bye.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Bye.
dialog: 
scene_heading: COME AROUND TUCK
dialog: 
text: to see he's been standing in front of the gallery looking at

scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:

scene_heading: EXT. BASEMENT - LATER
dialog: 
text: White cement steps lead down to the basement door. Bert,
text: doing his best to be covert, creeps to the window looking
text: into the basement.
dialog: 
text: From his vantage through a crack in the curtains, he can see
text: THE CLOWN sitting in a chair. The room is very dark, but his
text: shape is there.
dialog: 
text: Bert creeps down the steps and tries the knob. It opens and
text: he slips in. INSIDE, he keeps his back to the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: (whispered hiss)
dialog: What are you doing?
dialog: 
text: The clown's head turns slowly. He looks back to the answering
text: machine on the table, then again to Bert. He stands.
speaker_heading: CLOWN
dialog: Doc-tor?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Yes. What are you doing, Doug?
dialog: 
text: The clown cocks his head at an angle. He talks very slow,
text: very stilted.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOWN
dialog: My name is Shivers. Shivers the
dialog: clown.
dialog: 
text: Bert's edgy and uncomfortable. The darkness is pervasive, and
text: oh yeah, there's a homicidal clown twenty feet away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: All right. Shivers. What are you
dialog: doing?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOWN
dialog: What you told me. Getting better.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: (confused)
dialog: What? No. What you did--Amanda had
dialog: nothing to do with getting better.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOWN
dialog: A-man-da?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Yes. The girl you killed. This,
dialog: what you're doing, I thought we'd
dialog: talked about it. You've got to
dialog: stop this. You should come back
dialog: and start therapy with me again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOWN
dialog: You're...confusing me.
dialog: 
text: He takes a step up toward Bert, who instantly recoils.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Wait. Just...just wait until you
dialog: hear from me. I'll call you. I'll
dialog: help you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOWN
dialog: Help me get better?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Yes. Just wait for me. Okay?
text: The clown's breathing heavily.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOWN
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
text: Bert doesn't take his eyes off the clown as he opens the door
text: and backs out. The clown watches him go, then sits back down.
dialog: 
text: The phone begins RINGING.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AT BERT'S CAR
dialog: 
text: Bert rushes to his car, jumps in and locks the door. He
text: fumbles with his cel phone and dials from his phone book.
text: BUSY.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Damnit!
dialog: (redials, it's
dialog: ringing)
dialog: What the hell do you think you're
dialog: doing? I thought we agreed using
dialog: Doug was a bad idea.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Why? Because he's nuts! Yes,
dialog: that's my professional opinion!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Come on Shane. This, this isn't
dialog: going to work. I've got--look,
dialog: this could come back and bite me

scene_heading: INT. HOUSE - EVENING
dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: HESTON'S POV
text: He's parked five houses down across the street. A canvas bag
text: is on the seat next to him.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TUCK'S HOUSE
dialog: 
text: Tuck enters, tossing his keys onto a table in the foyer. He
text: heads into the living room, picks up the remote from the
text: table and turns to drop back into the couch--
dialog: 
text: --and he sees the Art Gallery sitting on top of the pile of
text: magazines. He goes to it, picks it up, confused. Definitely
dialog: not where he left it.
dialog: 
text: He flips it open to the marker and Lynn's face stares out at
text: him. Then the next magazine below it with another page-marked
dialog: at Lynn.
dialog: 
text: He puts two and two together immediately. Mentally curses
text: himself. He grabs the phone and dials Lynn's number.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LYNN'S HOUSE
dialog: 
text: Lynn paints. Pages of sketches are strewn about her. All
text: forgotten. Her mind is now on one thing, the painting in
text: front of her.
dialog: 
text: The PHONE RINGS but Lynn pays no attention. She's so focused
text: that she probably doesn't even hear it.
dialog: 
text: She's immersed in the work. Paying no attention to anything
text: around her. In the zone.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE
dialog: 
text: Officer Patrick zips up as he walks around from the backyard
text: where he was apparently taking a piss. A van pulls up in
text: front of the house with PARTY-PLUS on the side.
dialog: 
text: A HAPPY CLOWN gets out and walks up the sidewalk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IN HESTON'S CAR
dialog:

dialog: wasn't expecting this, but maybe there'll be an opening...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: 
text: can't believe it--a clown walking up the sidewalk--he fumbles
text: out his gun and points it at the clown, who doesn't notice it
text: because he's reading from a clipboard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICER PATRICK
dialog: Stop right there!
text: The clown's startled, just about drops his clipboard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAPPY CLOWN
dialog: WOAH! What the hell?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICER PATRICK
dialog: Get over here, get on the ground!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAPPY CLOWN
dialog: All right, okay--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICER PATRICK
dialog: NOW!

dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAPPY CLOWN
dialog: I didn't do nothin', I was called
dialog: out here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICER PATRICK
dialog: Sure you were. You got ID on you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAPPY CLOWN
dialog: Inside the suit. You gotta zip
text: down the zipper, in my back pocket
dialog: there.
dialog: 
text: From around the back of the house creeps SHIVERS THE CLOWN.
text: He grips the strings from a dozen floating helium balloons.
text: He sees the cop working to get the other clown's ID.
dialog: 
text: He walks out more confidently, coming up behind the two. The
text: cop's got the happy clown's ID out and is looking at it.
dialog: 
text: Shivers shifts hands, releasing the balloons to reveal that
text: he's been holding his axe, hidden by the balloons the whole
dialog: time.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TUCK'S HOUSE
dialog: 
text: Through the foyer window, Tuck can be seen starting his
text: motorcycle and PEELING off.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. LYNN'S HOUSE
dialog: 
text: The happy clown, looking over his shoulder back at the cop is
text: the first to see Shivers. A giant axe in his hands.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAPPY CLOWN
dialog: Hey...
text: Patrick turns just in time to see the descending axe blade.
text: It takes him in the back of the neck, almost decapitating
text: him. His body falls onto the happy clown who starts
text: hyperventilating.
dialog: 
text: Shivers spares him a look, then starts to turn toward the
text: front door. As if he has some sixth sense though, his gaze is
text: caught on Heston's car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HESTON
dialog: 
text: has his mouth wide open. He's trying to sit very still.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HESTON
dialog: Holy shit...
dialog: 
text: The clown seems disturbed. From this distance it's hard to
text: tell if he can see Heston, but he seems to be staring right
text: at him.
dialog: 
text: Shivers turns suddenly, stalking back the way he came.
dialog: 
text: The happy clown has his eyes closed, must be going into shock
text: or something. Hyperventilating still.
dialog: 
text: Heston's surprised by the sudden turn and takes a look up and
text: down the street. Doesn't see any witnesses. He reaches into
text: his canvas bag and grabs out a cheap rubber clown mask, pulls
text: it over his head.
dialog: 
text: He quickly pulls his car in front of Lynn's house. He gets
text: out of the car--one hand inside his jacket conceals the gun
text: from earlier--and hurries up the front walk.
dialog: 
text: Past the dead cop and the pinned clown. He runs smack into
text: the front door which surprises him by being locked. He SLAMS
text: his shoulder into it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INSIDE
dialog: 
text: Lynn's startled from her work by the BANG against her front
text: door. She puts the brush down as there's another BANG.
dialog: 
text: She bolts to her feet just as the third SLAM shatters the
text: lock and blows the door open. Heston moves in fast, kicking
text: the door shut behind him, and stops to listen.
dialog: 
text: From Lynn's POV, she saw the clown-masked intruder move past
text: the room she's in. She's terrified, but stifles her scream.
text: The man is not in her sight now.
dialog: 
text: She looks around for a weapon, anything, but there's nothing,
dialog: no help at all.
text: Heston doesn't wait long. Not hearing anything, he assumes
text: she's upstairs asleep. He quickly creeps up the stairs toward
text: her bedroom.
dialog: 
text: Lynn didn't hear him go up the carpeted steps. Quietly she
text: creeps to the edge of the wall, peers around the corner. He's
text: not in sight.
dialog: 
text: Did he go to the kitchen or up the stairs? She eyes the door.
text: Ten feet away and closed.
dialog: 
text: She creeps out quietly, reaching for doorknob, keeping her
text: eyes darting back and forth between the upstairs and the
dialog: kitchen.
dialog: 
text: Her hand's on the knob when Heston comes out from the
text: bedroom. His eyes widen inside the mask as he sees her at the
dialog: door.
dialog: 
text: He FIRES without aiming.
dialog: 
text: The bullet splinters a chunk out of the door but misses its
text: mark. Lynn SCREAMS and runs toward the back of the house,
text: toward the glass door.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. LYNN'S HOUSE
dialog: 
text: Tuck pulls up on his motorcycle and gets off. He sees the
text: dead cop, the clown pinned underneath him, and leaps off his

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LYNN'S HOUSE
dialog: 
text: Heston FIRES AGAIN and rushes down the stairs after her.
dialog: 
text: Lynn runs into the sliding glass door, pulls it, but it's

text: budge--she sees the stick wedged to keep it shut, grabs it--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HESTON
speaker_heading: HEY!
dialog: 
text: She turns, holding the stick in front of her like a sword.
text: She's terrified.
dialog: 
text: Heston's there, made all the more menacing by his clown mask.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HESTON
dialog: Nothin' personal, lady. Just
dialog: delivering a message from your
text: husband. He says goodbye.
text: He raises the gun level to her head.
dialog: 
text: TUCK dives into Heston's back, bearing him to the ground.
text: Heston drops the gun to keep from slamming headfirst into the
dialog: carpet.
dialog: 
text: Tuck struggles to keep control, keep Heston down, but
text: Heston's trying to get up, get some leverage. They're
text: grappling for control, rolling and sliding across the floor
text: like a couple of high-school wrestlers.
dialog: 
text: Neither one sees Lynn pick up the gun.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BERT'S HOUSE/BEDROOM
dialog: 
text: In the background RUNNING WATER can be heard. Bert pulls off
text: his shirt, then massages his trapezius like his neck is
text: bothering him.
dialog: 
text: He looks up at the KNOCK on his front door.
dialog: 
text: He leaves his bedroom and heads for the front door. He looks
text: through the peephole, sees no one, then opens the door.
dialog: 
text: There's no one there. There is a van with tinted windows in
text: front of his next door neighbor's house. He looks at it, but
text: it doesn't register.
dialog: 
text: He goes back inside and shuts the door, rubbing at his aching
dialog: neck some more.
dialog: 
scene_heading: IN HIS BATHROOM
dialog: 
text: He steps into the steaming hot water, lies back. It's a
text: little cramped, but he doesn't seem to mind. He takes a
text: second to let the heat soak into his muscles.
dialog: 
text: Then he reaches over the side of the bathtub and grabs his
text: book. We can see that he left the bathroom door cracked open
dialog: slightly.
dialog: 
text: He relaxes, getting into the book. There's a CREAK from right
text: outside the bathroom door. Bert lowers the book and looks
text: toward it.
dialog: 
text: It must be his imagination, but the door looks like it's open
text: a little farther. He goes back to reading. Turns the page.
dialog: 
text: There's another creak, but this time there's something
text: different. Without lowering the book, Bert can feel it.
dialog: 
text: There's a pregnant moment where he looks like he's not going
text: to lower the book and look. But he finally does.
text: The clown stands in the bathroom doorway, the axe in hand.
text: Bert looks like he's just run into a bear and doesn't know
dialog: whether to run or play dead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Now, hold on a minute--
dialog: 
text: The clown rushes him, jabbing the axe point viciously into
text: Bert as he tries to get up.
dialog: 
text: Blood mixes into the water as the clown continues to stab,
dialog: stab, stab.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LYNN'S HOUSE
dialog: 
text: Heston jabs an elbow at Tuck's head. Tuck turns his head but
text: still takes it in the cheek hard. It's enough to let him slip
text: out of Tuck's grasp. He turns to run--
dialog: 
text: --Lynn, a distant look in her eye, stands there pointing the
text: gun at him.
dialog: 
text: Tuck stands up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HESTON
dialog: Lady...you don't know how to use
dialog: that.
dialog: 
text: Famous last words. Lynn pulls the trigger. Glass shatters
text: behind Heston. He turns to look and sees a ruined picture
text: featuring a bullet hole.
dialog: 
text: He turns back to her and smiles but the smile dies as he
text: feels something on his chest. Blood is soaking his T-shirt.
dialog: 
text: Heston has enough time to realize he's in a direct line
text: between the picture and the gun, then the life fades from his
text: eyes. He collapses sideways.
dialog: 
text: Tuck is shocked. Lynn can't seem to get her eyes off of
text: Heston's body.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Lynn. Give me the gun.
dialog: 
text: She turns her eyes from the dying man to Tuck. Their strange
text: lack of depth gives Tuck cause for concern.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: (reassuring)
dialog: Lynn.
text: He holds his hand out. After a moment, she hands him the gun.

scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:

scene_heading: EXT. LYNN'S HOUSE - LATER
dialog: 
text: Police cars are clustered in front of the house. Lynn and
text: Tuck stand off to the side trying to stay out of the way.
text: There's an uncomfortable distance between them that Tuck's
text: trying to figure a way into.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Hey...listen, I wanted to explain
dialog: about the magazines.
dialog: 
text: He hopes she'll say forget about it, but she doesn't. He goes
dialog: on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: I've been a big art fan for years,
dialog: all kinds, and I first saw your
dialog: art in those mags. When I heard
dialog: about the showing downtown, I
dialog: thought it would be neat to see
dialog: some of your paintings up close.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: You said you saw my picture in the
dialog: program.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: I did. That's just not the only
dialog: place I saw your picture. I didn't
dialog: want you to flip out and think I
dialog: was a stalker, which...is probably
dialog: what you're thinking right about
dialog: now.
dialog: 
text: Lynn's noncommittal. Detective Peters comes out of the house
text: and heads over to them. He pulls Lynn away from Tuck so he
text: can talk to her privately.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: Well. Helluva shot, Miss Blodgett.
dialog: He's pretty dead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Good.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: Remorse. I like that. It seems
dialog: your husband paid that guy to kill
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: For a detective, you have the
dialog: shittiest people skills I've ever
dialog: seen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: Thanks, I've taken classes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Why would Bert do that? He's
dialog: divorcing me, he's taking
dialog: everything--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: I'll make a wild guess and say
dialog: he's got a sizeable life insurance
dialog: policy out on you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Oh. Oh my God...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: Yeah. We found a tape recorder in
text: Mr. Hitman's car. He'd taped a few
dialog: conversations with your husband,
dialog: conversations where your husband
dialog: hired him to kill you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: No...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: Yep. Plain old greed. I guess
text: getting the hitman to dress up as
dialog: a clown must have been him being
dialog: creative. Hell, it's as good a
dialog: disguise as any.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: But he wasn't the clown I saw--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
text: He probably changed outfits.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I don't think so.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: Are you positive?
dialog: 
text: She thinks. That night on the porch, it happened to so fast,
text: it was dark and she fainted...she just can't be sure.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: He had makeup on when I saw him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: Probably figured out a mask was
text: much less work. Easier to take off.
dialog: 
text: He's got his mind made up and he's starting to convince her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Why didn't he kill me that night
dialog: then? After I fainted?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: Maybe he got scared off by your
dialog: friend on the phone. We'll never
dialog: know for sure.
dialog: (waves it off)
dialog: You just take it easy. We're
dialog: looking for your husband now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: You don't know where he is?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
text: We think he's on the run. No sign
dialog: of him at his house. Don't worry
dialog: about it, we'll get him soon.
dialog: Whatever you were asking for in
dialog: this divorce thing...ask for more.
dialog: You'll get it.
dialog: 
text: She nods, realizing the implications for her and Nicholas. No
dialog: way will they give custody to Bert now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: If you have any other questions,
dialog: give me a call.
dialog: (hands her a card)
dialog: My home numbers's on the back.
dialog: Night or day, doesn't matter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Okay. Thanks.
dialog: 
text: He smiles reassuringly and leaves. Tuck comes over.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: I heard. I think you should try
dialog: and get some sleep.
dialog: 
text: Lynn nods, but looks doubtful.
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Can I give you a call tomorrow?
dialog: When everything's more normal
dialog: again?
dialog: 
text: She thinks it over, decides she wants him to.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Okay. I guess I could give you a
dialog: second chance, seeing that you
dialog: saved my life and all.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: (his smile's back)
dialog: Great.
dialog: 
text: He gives her a quick hug, gets on his cycle, and rides off.

scene_heading: INT. LYNN'S HOUSE
dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: IN HER DREAM
dialog: 
text: A sterile, white hall, infinitely long. People move in and
text: out of our sight, all blurry, out of focus. As they clear out
text: we see a YOUNG BOY sitting on a bench.
dialog: 
text: He looks at us sadly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YOUNG BOY
text: Dead. They're all dead.
dialog: 
text: He stands up and points a finger at us accusingly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YOUNG BOY

dialog: 
text: THE CLOWN's face pops into view staring right at us, smiling
text: like a demon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: 
text: sits up in bed, her heart racing. Looks around, starting to
dialog: get her bearings.
dialog: 
text: She sees a clown doll sitting on her dresser that wasn't
dialog: there before. Who could have put that there...?
text: All at once, it begins to turn its head, its eyes glaring a
dialog: malevolent red--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: 
text: sits up in bed for real this time, looking immediately to her
text: dresser. No clown doll there.
dialog: 
text: She looks out the window; the sun is coming up on a new day.

scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:

scene_heading: INT. GALLERY - DAY
dialog: 
text: Lynn, Phillip and Mr. Parrish are staring at a painting that

text: stares in wonder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. PARRISH
dialog: It's amazing. Simply amazing.
dialog: 
text: We see the painting. It's the one Lynn was working on of Mr.
text: Parrish's father, and it captures the look he wanted, to
text: perfection. Tears appear in his eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. PARRISH
dialog: It's even better than I could have
dialog: imagined. I can't thank you enough.
dialog: (to Phillip)
dialog: Please. Wrap it up.
dialog: 
text: Phillip takes the painting off to wrap it. Mr. Parrish pulls
text: his checkbook out and begins writing. He finishes, signing
text: his name with a flourish.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. PARRISH
dialog: What was the final price agreed
dialog: upon?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Twenty thousand.
dialog: 
text: Mr. Parrish nods, he knew. He hands her the check. She takes
text: it without looking at it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. PARRISH
dialog: I'll spread the word about your
dialog: talent, Miss Blodgett. You have
dialog: quite a future before you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Thank you.
text: Mr. Parrish walks to the front door to where Phillip is

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. PARRISH
dialog: Good day.

text: He takes his painting and leaves.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: Wow. Home run, Lynn.
dialog: 
text: She smiles, looking at the check.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I can sure put this to--

dialog: Oh my God.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: This check is made out for a
dialog: hundred thousand dollars. He gave
dialog: me a hundred grand.
dialog: 
text: The PHONE RINGS. Phillip gets it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: Hello? Mr. Flynn?
dialog: 
text: He shoots a questioning look to Lynn. She nods and reaches
dialog: for the phone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: Hold on please.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Hello? Pretty good actually. A
dialog: hundred thousand dollars good.

scene_heading: INT. PHILLIP'S - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Phillip is busy in the kitchen making what looks to be an
text: elaborate meal. He checks in one of his cabinets for noodles--
dialog: none there.
text: He begins to go downstairs to get some but something in his
text: backyard catches his eye. There's someone out there standing
text: in the shadow of a tree.
dialog: 
text: Phillip frowns. From his vantage it's hard to see anything.
dialog: 
text: He goes back the way he came, through his hall, into his
text: bedroom. Looks out the back window.
dialog: 
text: He's got a slightly better view, but it's still not great.
text: The person almost looks like...a clown. Phillip draws back
text: away from the window, frowning.
dialog: 
text: He walks back into the hall and turns into the guest room on
text: the corner of his house. One window faces the backyard while
text: another next to it faces the side of his house. He looks out
text: the backyard window.
dialog: 
text: Has to blink once. The clown is gone. Unless...Phillip tries
text: to peer around to see if the clown is behind the tree, but it
dialog: doesn't look like it.
dialog: 
text: Phillip leans back again and doesn't see the clown staring in
text: the side window at him.
dialog: 
text: He turns to leave as the clown raises the axe, swings it at
text: the window. On the axe crashing through glass:

dialog: Nice theater.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Only the best for you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Will we be able to get popcorn?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: With butter. And a Coke.
dialog: 
dialog: He winks like, I got the hook-up.

speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Hey Tuck! I'm about ready. You're
dialog: gonna be in theater eight.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Great. Thanks. We're gonna grab
dialog: some concessions.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I can send Bobby down to do that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: No, that's cool. I know where
dialog: everything is.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Help yourself.
dialog: 
text: He jogs back to the projection booth, punching the code to
dialog: get through the door.
dialog: 
text: Tuck motions Lynn to follow him behind the concession booth.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL
dialog: 
text: A thin set of concrete steps runs down to a steel door, all
text: bathed dimly yellow by the auxillery lights.
dialog: 
text: The clown makes his way slowly up the steps. The giant axe in
text: one hand. A canvas bag in his other hand, THUMP THUMPING with
dialog: every step.
dialog: 
text: Something short and thin is inside the bag, and it's not
text: moving. Something that looks like a small body...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MOVIE THEATER/CONCESSION
dialog: 
text: A bucket of popcorn sits on the counter next to the soda
text: fountain. Tuck is filling two cups at the same time.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: You're like an expert. If I didn't
dialog: know better, I'd swear you've done
dialog: that before.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Burger King when I was in high
dialog: school. It's a lost art.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: You know, I worked at a theater
dialog: when I was in high school. Didn't
dialog: last two months.
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: They don't know what they lost.
dialog: 
text: He lets off of the taps at the same time. Both sodas are
text: identically filled. He waits until the foam goes away and
text: finishes filling them.
dialog: 
text: He pops a top on them and hands her one.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Ready?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: (suddenly occurs to
dialog: her)
dialog: What are we seeing?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: I was thinking some scary horror
dialog: movie where you'd have to snuggle
dialog: close to me, but given the past
dialog: couple of days...
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: I opted for a sappy love movie
dialog: instead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Good choice.
dialog: 
text: They head toward the auditorium.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PROJECTION ROOM
dialog: 
text: Jeff is carrying the reel of film--it's the entire movie
text: rolled together, and it's so big he can't even see around it.
text: He slides it onto a platter and threads it through the
text: projector.
dialog: 
text: BOBBY, a pimply teen, pops out of the bathroom and shouts
dialog: down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I'm gonna go make sure the doors
text: are all locked up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Okay!
dialog: 
text: Bobby disappears out the door as Jeff finishes threading the
dialog: film.
dialog: 
text: As he stands up, movement at the far end of the projection
text: booth catches his eye.
text: He squints. It's hard to tell. Small pools of light at each
text: projector are the only illumination. Most of the room is in
dialog: darkness.
dialog: 
text: Still...something's off. The shape isn't right at the far end.
dialog: 
text: Jeff makes his way slowly toward the end.
dialog: 
text: He's twenty feet away from the spot when the clown steps out
text: of the shadow. The only thing in his hand is the axe, but
text: it's shadowed in the darkness behind a film platter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: (jumps)
dialog: Hey!
dialog: (relieved for a
dialog: moment)
dialog: Scared the shit out of me.
dialog: 
text: Then he realizes--it's late at night and there's a clown in
text: his projection booth. It dawns on him: Someone's playing a
dialog: joke.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Did Bobby put you up to this?
dialog: 
text: The clown takes a step toward him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOWN
dialog: She'll pay.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: This ain't cool, man. You can't be
dialog: up here. This is--
dialog: 
text: The clown takes another step, splashing a shaft of light onto
text: the axe blade.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Woah.
dialog: (steps back)
dialog: I'll get Bobby for you.
dialog: 
text: He takes another step. The clown raises the axe. Jeff turns
text: to run, panic growing on his face.
dialog: 
text: The clown hurls the axe. It spins twice and smacks solidly
text: into the back of Jeff's head. He drops.
dialog: 
text: The clown moves to him and grasps the haft of his axe. He
text: tugs at it, pulling Jeff's head from the ground, but the axe
text: doesn't come out.
text: He has to put one foot on Jeff's head, and with a vicious
text: yank, rips it free. He doesn't bother wiping it off as he
text: moves toward the door.
dialog: 
text: The clown moves to the small window that looks down into the
text: theater. He can see Tuck and Lynn seated in the middle of the
dialog: auditorium.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. AUDITORIUM
dialog: 
text: Tuck picks that moment to look back. From his vantage point,
text: the shape is too dark behind the window for him to recognize.
text: Thinking it's Jeff, he waves.
dialog: 
text: The clown backs away from the window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: I think he's getting ready to
dialog: start it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Good. This is a little past my

dialog: 
text: That taken care of, he hops the concession counter and turns
text: off the frozen drink machines. He heads through the back and
text: comes out at the rear concession entrance.
dialog: 
text: He takes a step toward the stairs, but stops and makes a
text: sudden decision to head into the bathroom.
dialog: 
text: WHISTLING no particular tune, he enters a stall and unzips,
text: not bothering to shut the door.
dialog: 
text: The clown's boots on the tile floor don't make enough noise
dialog: to alert Bobby.
dialog: 
text: Bobby's done pissing and shakes.
dialog: 
text: The clown stands right behind him outside of the stall.
dialog: 
text: Bobby tucks himself back in his pants and is about to turn
text: when the clown RAMS the axe point through his back, throwing
text: the helpless teen against the wall in front of him. Something
text: major's been hit; blood is running out of his chest like a
dialog: river.
dialog: 
text: His strength leaving, Bobby falls to one knee over the

dialog: 
text: A HOLLOW SOUND, muffled, seems to come from the entrance to
dialog: the auditorium.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: What's he doing now?
dialog: 
text: The clown walks slowly into the auditorium. He's completely

text: wall that supports the stadium seating.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: (joking)
dialog: I'm gonna have to speak to a

dialog: 
text: No expression from the clown.
dialog: 
text: Tuck is looking at Lynn when the clown rounds the first row
text: of seats. She's looking right at the clown, and the look on
text: her face is enough to wipe the smile off of his.
dialog: 
text: The question forms on his face, but he turns to look, and
dialog: sees.
dialog: 
text: The clown has stopped at the foot of the first stair. He
text: holds the bloody axe in both hands.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: No...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOWN
dialog: You're gonna pay.
dialog: 
text: Tuck stands, pulling a terrified Lynn to her feet. Tuck grabs

text: pushes Lynn down a step. The clown backs up. Tuck doesn't
dialog: move.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
text: Move slowly down the stairs.
dialog: 
text: Lynn, almost dazed, does. Instead of following, Tuck moves up
text: a stair. The clown doesn't even look at him. Focused entirely
text: on Lynn, watching her like a cat about to pounce.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Hey!
dialog: 
text: Tuck doesn't even exist to the clown.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: (to Lynn)
dialog: Wait.
dialog: 
text: She stops. The moment hangs, all three staring at one
text: another. Lynn and the clown as if in a trance, Tuck's mind
text: racing with indecision.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: RUN!
dialog: 
text: He throws his soda at the clown and runs down the stairs
text: toward Lynn. The soda's a great throw. It gets the clown's
text: attention, something coming at him from his peripheral
text: vision. He bats it away with his axe, then crosses through
text: the aisle in pursuit of the fleeing couple.
dialog: 
text: Lynn and Tuck burst out the auditorium door. Tuck, thinking
text: quickly, overturns the large trash can in front to block the
dialog: door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Come on!
dialog: 
text: He grabs her hand and pulls her toward the front doors. They
text: smack into them and can't understand why they don't open.
text: They're just push-lever doors, but they don't realize Bobby
text: has locked them with a key.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE CLOWN
dialog: 
text: has run into the auditorium door, which is jammed shut by the
text: trash can. He kicks at the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: 
text: runs to the single door to the side of the main entrances and
text: tries to open it. No joy there either.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Break them!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: With what? It's reinforced safety
dialog: glass.
dialog: 
text: Tuck hears the sound of the DOOR hitting the TRASHCAN as the
text: clown kicks it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Come on!
dialog: 
text: He grabs her hand and heads down the side corridor leading
text: back toward the theaters.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE CLOWN
dialog: 
text: has kicked the door enough that the trash can no longer jams
text: it. He slides out and strides toward the front.
dialog: 
text: Tuck and Lynn emerge through the corridor door, right back in
text: front of the auditorium entrances. Tuck cautiously goes right
text: back to the theater they came from.
dialog: 
text: He opens the door as wide as he can without hitting the trash
text: can, lets Lynn slide in, and he follows.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE CLOWN
dialog: 
text: stands in the lobby where Tuck and Lynn were moments before.
text: He's listening, but there's no sound.
dialog: 
text: His gaze travels from the glass doors to the concession
text: stand. Considering. Back to the doors.
dialog: 
text: A table next to the concession stand has paper and pens for
text: entering a contest. The clown goes to it, propping his bloody
text: axe on top while he grabs a sheet of paper and a pen.
dialog: 
text: He begins writing.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DETECTIVE PETERS' HOUSE - SAME TIME
dialog: 
text: Peters is in shorts, T-shirt and socks. He's putting together
text: a puzzle at his kitchen table. It looks to be about 10,000
text: pieces, but he's doing pretty good.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMPUTER (O.S.)
dialog: Thrill me!
dialog: 
text: Peters puts down the puzzle piece he's holding and goes to
text: his computer. He clicks a couple of buttons and his email
text: pops up, displaying the message "NEW EMAIL".
scene_heading: It reads "BLOOD SAMPLE #4990345 DIC: PETERS". The second line
scene_heading: reads "DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE KNOWN SEX OFFENDER DOUG
scene_heading: RICHARDSON".
dialog: 
text: Peters is getting interested now. He reads on and something
text: catches his eye.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: Oh shit...
dialog: 
text: Under WHEREABOUTS next to a list of dates it says "COMMITED:
scene_heading: ROUNDSVILLE MENTAL INSTITUTION, DOCTOR: BERT TOKYO".
dialog: 
text: Peters grabs his cel phone and dials a number.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: Vic, it's Peters. Yeah, I'm up
dialog: late. Look, we got a problem. That
dialog: blood sample from the girl's
dialog: fingertips--came back a match to
dialog: a DOJ sex offender named Doug
dialog: Richardson.
dialog: 
text: Something from the other end.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: Yeah, not Heston and get this:
dialog: He's got Leber's congenital
dialog: amaurosis. No I didn't make that
dialog: up. It's a rare disease, normally
dialog: causes blindness, but in some
dialog: cases it can cause the sclera of
text: the eye to turn black. And to top
dialog: it off, this guy was a psych case
dialog: over at Roundsville and you'll
dialog: never guess who his doctor was.
dialog: (smiles as Vic
dialog: guesses)
dialog: Right. I think he had two people
dialog: trying to kill her. Send some
text: uniforms over to her house, have
text: them wake her up and secure it.
dialog: Call me when that's done.
dialog: 
text: Vic says something on his end.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: Right. Hey, see if we can get some
dialog: pics of this guy. Yeah.
dialog: 
text: He hangs up, but looks worried.
dialog: 
scene_heading: IN THE AUDITORIUM
text: Tuck rushes Lynn up the stairs to the door at the top. He
text: peers through the small window--coast looks clear--then leads
text: the way through.
dialog: 
text: They're on the second floor, a small level overlooking the
text: front lobby. A stairway leads down the front.
dialog: 
text: Tuck moves to the projection-room door and pulls on it. It's
text: locked; a numeric keypad is set into the wall.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: (whisper)
dialog: Knock on it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
text: Too loud. He's got his radio on in
dialog: there anyway.
dialog: 
text: Tuck tries a combination, pulls gently. Still locked. He
text: tries another, pulls again. Locked.
dialog: 
text: Lynn takes a look at the keypad. Five numbers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Are you kidding? There's a hundred
dialog: and twenty combinations.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: You have another idea?
dialog: 
text: He keeps trying.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOWNSTAIRS
dialog: 
text: The clown stands in the center of the lobby. Whatever he did
text: with the paper, there's no sign of it now.
dialog: 
text: He's listening. The sound of Tuck trying combinations can
text: barely be heard, and from the lobby it's hard to know where
text: it's coming from.
dialog: 
text: The clown hefts his axe and walks back toward the
text: auditoriums, passing the stairwell to the second floor. He
text: suddenly stops though, realizing the sound is coming from
text: above him.
dialog: 
text: He backtracks and begins climbing the stairs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ABOVE
dialog: 
text: Lynn has moved to the top of the stairs and is peering down
text: them. Suddenly, the top of the clown's head comes into her
text: sightline, but because of the angle, he doesn't see her.
text: She rushes back to Tuck.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: (harsh whisper)
dialog: He's coming!
dialog: 
text: Tuck's still trying combos. Nothing's working.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: If he gets to the top, run back
text: into the theater.
dialog: 
text: He keeps going.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE CLOWN
dialog: 
text: is halfway up the stairs. He can definitely hear them now.
text: The paint smile on his face seems to widen. His stride,
text: however, doesn't quicken.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AT THE TOP
dialog: 
text: Lynn's petrified, watching the stairs with her back against
text: the wall. Anticipating the appearance of her deepest fear
dialog: brought to life.
dialog: 
text: And appear he does. Slowly, inevitably, his head appears,
text: then his axe. Step by step he's almost to the top.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: He's here...
dialog: 
text: Tuck looks quickly, goes back to the codes. As the clown gets
text: to the top step, the door surprises all three of them by
text: opening to Tuck's pull.
dialog: 
text: They dart in to the projection room as the clown rushes at
text: them. Tuck pulls the door shut just in time as the clown
text: slams into it.
dialog: 
text: The clown pulls on the door, but it's locked again.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PROJECTION ROOM
dialog: 
text: Lynn and Tuck take a breather. Safe for the moment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Jeff!
dialog: 
text: There's no one in sight.
speaker_heading: TUCK
text: He may be on the second level.
dialog: (points to the phone)
dialog: Call the police. I'll go find
dialog: him.
dialog: 
text: She goes to the phone and picks it up. For a moment you can
text: see that she thinks it's going to be dead, but it's not. Like
text: a prayer answered, she's got a dial tone.
dialog: 
text: She hits 911.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DETECTIVE PETERS' HOUSE - SAME TIME
dialog: 
text: Peters is dressed now and heading for the door. He forgets
text: his keys, goes back for them on the counter, and his radio
text: CRACKLES to life, scaring the crap out of him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: Peters.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COP (RADIO)
text: She's not at the house. It's empty.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: No sign of a break in?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COP (RADIO)
dialog: Nope. However, dispatch just got
text: a 911 from a woman who says she's,
dialog: uh, being chased by a killer
text: clown. At the Columbia Golden Arts
dialog: theater.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: They have units on the way?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COP (RADIO)
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: Tell the supervising seargent I'm
text: ten minutes away.
dialog: 
text: He rushes out the door.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MOVIE THEATER - SAME TIME
dialog: 
text: Tuck comes down the stairs. Lynn's running his way.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Did you get through?
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Yes. I left the phone off the
text: hook. They say they're on the way.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: (nods)
text: Good. Jeff isn't up there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: You don't think he's...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: I hope not. Come on, let's see if
text: the back door's open.
dialog: 
text: He leads her toward the door the clown originally came in. He
text: stops suddenly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Wait here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: He's been here.
dialog: 
text: He tries to block her view, but she sees anyway. Jeff sits,
text: his back against the door. Blood glistens all over him and
text: his eyes are wide open, forever staring at nothing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Is the door open?
dialog: 
text: Tuck gently moves Jeff's body out of the way, then tries the
text: door. Doesn't move. He throws himself against it, but it
text: still doesn't budge.
dialog: 
text: Lynn begins searching through Jeff's pants.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: What are you doing?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
text: Looking for keys.
dialog: 
dialog: Tuck's surprised by her initiative; you don't see him going
text: through the dead guy's pants. She finishes, coming up empty.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Nothing?
dialog: 
text: She shakes her head, hopeless.
scene_heading: EXT. MOVIE THEATER
dialog: 
text: Four patrol cars with flashing lights are parked in front of
text: the theater as Detective Peters pulls up in his unmarked.
dialog: 
text: One OLDER COP hurries over to intercept Peters.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
text: Detective Peters, homicide.
dialog: Where's your sarge?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLDER COP
text: Hasn't shown up yet. All the doors
dialog: are locked, I got guys on
text: perimeter around the building.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: Why haven't you gone in? There's
dialog: a woman trapped in there with--
text: well, a murderer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLDER COP
dialog: Can't go in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: Why not?
dialog: 
text: The cop motions him over, they go to the front door. A piece
text: of paper is taped on the glass door facing out. Written in
text: child-like scrawl are the words "COME IN THEY DIE".
dialog: 
text: Peters sees it, refrains from cursing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLDER COP
dialog: I've called in the tac team.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: This guy's not taking hostages.
dialog: 
text: The older cops shrugs. Nothing he can do. Peters knows it too.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: Dammit.
dialog: 
text: He stares in through the glass impotently.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MOVIE THEATER
dialog: 
text: Tuck and Lynn rush back to the phone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Tell them we're trapped in the
text: projection room.
text: Lynn picks up the phone, which she left off the hook. Tuck's
text: looking around for a weapon. The best he finds is a broom
text: with detachable end. He unscrews it and is left with a five-
text: foot pole.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Hello? Hello?
dialog: 
text: She clicks the hang-up button a couple of times.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
text: The line's dead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INTERCUT
dialog: 
text: The junction box where all the phone lines come in and go
text: out. They're hanging out of the box like stray hair, having
text: been ripped out.
dialog: 
text: BACK TO SCENE
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: You have your cel phone?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: (shakes her head)
dialog: It's in my car. You?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Didn't want anyone to get in touch
dialog: with me tonight. Okay, no problem.
dialog: We can wait it out here. The cops
dialog: should be here any minute. We'll
dialog: just wait.
dialog: 
text: Lynn moves to a group of doors, if only to keep herself busy.
text: The one on the left has a restroom sign on it. The other two
text: doors have nothing on them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Where do these go?
dialog: 
text: Tuck comes over and shrugs. Then he KICKS one door,
text: shattering the lock and throwing it open. He reaches in and
text: flicks on the light.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: (answering her
dialog: question)
text: Manager's office.
dialog: 
text: They check out the room. Lynn confirms the phones don't work
text: in this room either. Tuck's interested in a giant monitor
text: with buttons on it.
text: The monitor shows different parts of the theater; every
text: camera in the building is patched into it.
dialog: 
text: Tuck pushes a button and the view switches to one particular
text: camera. He pushes another and it moves to another camera.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Take a look at this.
dialog: (she does)
text: Security cameras.
dialog: 
text: Tuck pushes button after button, searching for any sign of
text: the clown. He doesn't seem to be on any of the cameras.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Where is he?
dialog: 
text: Tuck hits the button that shows all sixteen cameras at one
text: time. Two of the monitors show the outside parking lot which
text: has police cars and officers all around.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Look. The cops are here.
dialog: 
text: Lynn smiles with relief, but the smile dies as she realizes
dialog: something.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: What are they waiting for? Why
dialog: aren't they coming in?
dialog: 
text: Tuck sees what she means. The cops seem to be taking up siege
dialog: positions.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Uh...I don't know. Unless they
dialog: think he's got us hostage...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: So we're on our own.
dialog: 
text: Now that it's been said out loud, it starts to sink in. Tuck
text: tries to be optimistic.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Don't worry. We're safe here.
dialog: 
text: The sound of METAL HITTING PLEXIGLASS makes Lynn jump. It
text: happens AGAIN.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Oh shit. He can reach the
text: projection window from the smaller
dialog: theaters.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Can he get through?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: ...I don't know.
dialog: 
text: WHACK! Then silence. Lynn and Tuck move out of the room and
text: wait in the center of the aisle, staring down past the
text: projectors into the darkness. Expecting the clown to appear.
dialog: 
dialog: Then WHACK!
dialog: 
text: After a moment of silence, Tuck leads Lynn slowly toward
text: where the sound came from. Bracing for the next slam, but the
text: silence drags.
dialog: 
text: They approach the window looking down into the theater. Very
text: slow. Like the clown's face is going to appear suddenly.
dialog: 
text: It doesn't, but what they see in the theater takes Lynn's
text: breath away. Shock. Fear. Hopelessness. It's all reflected in
text: her expression.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: (sotto voce)
dialog: Oh shit...
dialog: 
text: The clown stands in front of the theater screen, his axe
text: gripped in his left hand. His right hand rests on the
text: shoulder of Nicholas, who stands there in a daze. For some
text: reason the boy doesn't seem to be afraid.
dialog: 
text: The clown sees them in the window. He looks at Nicholas, then
text: back to Lynn and Tuck. His look says everything: The boy for
dialog: you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: I'll distract him. You get Nicky
text: out of there.
dialog: 
text: The shock seems to have focused Lynn.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: No. He'll kill you.
dialog: 
text: Lynn's sudden calmness worries Tuck.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Hey. I'm not gonna let anything
dialog: happen to either of you.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I'm okay. I'm okay.
dialog: (reassuring smile)
dialog: I'm going out there but I need you
dialog: to do something for me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: (can't believe it)
dialog: You're what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I'm tired...I'm tired of being
dialog: scared. And I won't let him hurt
dialog: my son. Now listen to me.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. AUDITORIUM
dialog: 
text: The clown stares at the now-empty window into the projection
text: room. Nicky's having a hard time keeping his eyes open.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN (O.S.)
dialog: All right.
dialog: 
text: The clown turns. Lynn stands at the foot of the theater.
text: Defiant and angry, but it's impossible for her to completely
text: conceal her fear.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I'm here. Let him go.
dialog: 
text: The clown turns. Sees her. He smiles, but it's a gruesome,
text: sadistic smile made even more hideous by his makeup. He
text: releases the boy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Come here, Nicky.
dialog: 
text: He does. Lynn kneels down in front of him, keeping her eyes
text: on the clown.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: (quiet)
dialog: Nicky, I want you to go outside
dialog: and wait for me. Understand?
dialog: 
text: He nods.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Go on.
dialog: 
text: He walks out, casting one glance back at his mother.
dialog: 
text: When he's gone, the clown takes a step toward Lynn.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Wait!
dialog: (the clown stops)
dialog: Why are you doing this? What do
dialog: you want?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOWN
dialog: To get...better.
dialog: 
text: He moves to the aisle. Lynn moves into a row of seats to keep
text: as much distance as possible between them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: But why me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOWN
dialog: It was your fault.
dialog: 
text: One step at a time the clown comes up. Lynn backs up until
text: she's at the foot of the other aisle. She backs her way
text: farther up the stairs as the clown begins to cross the row.
dialog: 
text: She's half-way up when he gets to the foot of the aisle
text: leading up to her. Gaining ground even though he's not
text: rushing.
dialog: 
text: He puts a foot on the stair. Lynn's not moving. Too petrified
dialog: to move...or waiting?
dialog: 
text: The clown takes another step, his grip on the axe tightening.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Wait!
dialog: 
text: The clown stops. Lynn's terrified, trying to hide it.
text: Desperate. Hoping this works.
dialog: 
text: Without turning her own head, she points back toward the
text: projection booth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Look!
dialog: 
text: Instinctually, the clown does.
dialog: 
text: A blinding BEAM OF LIGHT streaks out of the projector
text: redirected at the clown. It's a broad beam, 30,000 candle-
text: watts of power, full in the face.
dialog: 
text: He YELLS IN PAIN, turning away, but too late. He's blinded,
text: maybe permanently. Lynn shields her eyes and slides her way
text: across the row of seats.
text: Still averting her eyes from the light, she accidentally
text: kicks over a soda. The clown hears it, YELLS ANGRILY. He
text: climbs the stairs to her level and moves in her direction,
text: trying to hone in on the sound. He swings the axe in front of
text: him, even though he's not close to her.
dialog: 
text: The projector light is no longer following him. Lynn's
text: frozen, watching as the clown feels his way across the seats.
dialog: 
text: Coming closer. Lynn moves away, accidentally kicking ice from
text: the soda she just knocked down. The ice makes TIC TIC sounds
text: as it falls to the next level.
dialog: 
text: The clown, now knowing he's on the right track, starts to
text: move quickly toward her through the row.
dialog: 
text: Lynn turns and runs. The clown follows, stumbling against the
text: seats in his blind chase.
dialog: 
text: Her shoes now wet, Lynn slips as she tries to cut out of the
text: aisle, crashes against the wall. She turns--the clown stands
text: above her, his axe raised to deliver the killing blow--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK (O.S.)
dialog: Hey.
dialog: 
text: The clown turns toward the voice. He can't see it, but Tuck's
text: holding a broom handle like a baseball bat.
dialog: 
text: Tuck swings for the fences. The pole splinters in half as it
text: THWACKS into the clown's forehead. He falls back against the
dialog: stairs.
dialog: 
text: Tuck pulls Lynn to her feet and pushes her ahead of him. He
text: turns to look back at the clown.
dialog: 
text: Amazingly, the clown is already standing, the axe raised over
text: his head for a huge swipe at Tuck. Tuck's got nowhere to go.
text: In desperation, he lunges at the clown and grasps the axe
text: handle as it starts its downward arc.
dialog: 
text: He manages to stop it, but he has to hold on for dear life.
text: The clown is much stronger than he is, and now can feel him.
text: The clown releases one hand from the axe and grabs Tuck by
text: the throat.
dialog: 
text: With an iron grip, the clown begins to choke him. Tuck
text: desperately grasps out like the clown, his hand grabbing at
text: the clown's throat.
dialog: 
text: He squeezes, but the clown doesn't seem bothered. Just cocks
text: his head slightly and continues to choke the life out of Tuck.
text: Tuck pushes the axe to the side and SLUGS the clown in the
text: face. The clown is stunned for a second. Tuck PUNCHES him
text: again. It seems to have the opposite effect, and brings the
text: clown out of his daze.
dialog: 
text: The clown swings the axe with his left hand in a swipe meant
text: to cut Tuck in half at the stomach.
dialog: 
text: Tuck barely catches it again. The clown's getting pissed.
text: He's still got a grip on Tuck's neck, and he uses it to throw
text: Tuck to the ground.
dialog: 
text: He takes his wood-chopping grip and raises the axe for a
text: massive swing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS (O.S.)
dialog: DROP IT OR YOU'RE DEAD!
dialog: 
text: The clown turns his head to the new threat. Detective Peters
text: and two cops stand at the entry to the auditorium, and every
text: one of them has a gun pointed at him.
dialog: 
text: The clown turns back to Tuck, a hateful sneer on his face. He
text: looks like he's gonna chop him anyway. Peters' finger
text: tightens on the trigger.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: DON'T!
dialog: 
text: The clown looks back to the cops. The tension finally relaxes
text: from his grip. He throws the axe to the ground.
dialog: 
text: Peters motions the cops over to the clown, and doesn't take
text: his sights off until he's securely cuffed. He goes over to
dialog: Tuck.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: Jesus...
dialog: 
text: He extends a hand to Tuck and helps him up.

text: Detective Peters finishes talking to some of the cops and
text: joins them, a grim look on his face.

speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: How you holding up?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: We're okay. What about Julie?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: She's dead. I'm sorry.
dialog: 
text: Tuck tries to comfort Lynn by putting his arm around her. For
text: a moment, the three almost look like a family. Peters notices
text: this and seems to feel a little awkward, shifts uncomfortably.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: The paramedics are going to need
dialog: to take Nicholas to the hospital
dialog: for a while. Just do a few tests.
dialog: You can ride in the ambulance if
dialog: you want.
dialog: 
text: She nods, shock setting in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: I'll follow you.
dialog: 
text: They follow Peters outside toward the flashing lights.

scene_heading: INT. LYNN'S CAR - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Lynn, dead tired, on her way home from the hospital. Nicholas
text: is asleep in the passenger seat. There's a BEEP from the back
dialog: seat.
dialog: 
text: At first Lynn doesn't notice it. It BEEPS again, and she
text: remembers her cel phone in the back seat. She grabs it and
text: sees she has a message.
dialog: 
text: She dials her voice mail and listens.
dialog: 
scene_heading: VOICE MAIL OPERATOR
text: Today, two thirty-four a.m.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP (PHONE)
dialog: (weak, barely audible)
dialog: Lynn...Lynn...
dialog: 
text: The line goes dead. Lynn looks at her car clock: 3:32
text: Lynn has a terrible thought. What if the clown went to
text: Phillip's like he did to Julie's? She dials the phone, gets
text: a BUSY signal.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Oh no...Phillip.
dialog: 
text: She turns down a side street, headed toward Phillip's.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PHILLIP'S - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Not many lights on at Phillip's house. Lynn looks at Nicky,
text: still asleep, then back to Phillip's. Nothing looks amiss.
dialog: Phillip could be asleep. Maybe it was nothing...
dialog: 
text: She locks the car doors and heads up the walkway. At the
text: front door she pauses. It's open a crack.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Oh no...
dialog: 
text: She pushes the door open, dreading what she's about to see,
text: while dialing 911 on her cel phone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INSIDE
dialog: 
text: The place is trashed. Chairs and tables overturned. Pictures
text: ripped from the walls.
dialog: 
text: Lynn makes herself go in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Phillip...? Please...
dialog: 
text: She moves in, completely expecting to find Phillip's body,
text: the phone in her hand forgotten. Bracing herself for what
text: she's about to find.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP (O.S.)
dialog: Lynn?
dialog: 
text: She can't believe it. She starts to move toward his voice,
text: but stops when she sees him. He's standing in the hall, his
text: back to her. Something's not right though...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
text: I heard it on the police scanner.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Phillip, what...?
dialog: 
text: Phillip turns, but the face that meets her is nightmarish.
text: His face is roughly painted, like he did it himself. He looks
text: like the shark-toothed clown from one of her paintings. Lynn
text: recoils, confused.
dialog: 
text: Not really scared. Yet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: He didn't kill you. I had my
dialog: doubts; he wasn't the brightest
dialog: bulb, was he? I think he actually
dialog: believed it was his parents that
dialog: your dad drove off the road.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: What...what are you talking about?
dialog: 
text: Phillip strolls into the kitchen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: I'm not one for long explanations.
dialog: Suffice it to say I've been
dialog: keeping my eye on you for a long
dialog: time now. Over twenty years. There
dialog: was a time I thought I could
dialog: simply forget what you did...
dialog: 
text: He pulls a large butcher knife out of the drawer and holds it
text: up, inspecting its edge.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: Of course, that didn't last. And
dialog: now...now, you're going to move
dialog: away? You think you can get away
dialog: from me now?
dialog: 
text: He's moving slowly around the room. Discretely putting
text: himself closer to the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: I don't understand...what--why are
dialog: you dressed like that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: I see it like it was yesterday. I
text: was twelve. Sitting on the bench
text: in the waiting area. Doctors
text: rushing around...hurt, sick people
dialog: everywhere. That awful smell...
dialog: 
text: He's rambling, staring at the blade, mesmerized by his
text: reflection maybe, but now he's closer to the front door than
dialog: Lynn is.
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: And what I keep remembering--it
dialog: haunts me in my sleep--was those
text: policemen who walked by.
dialog: (mimics one)
dialog: "The little girl, she distracted
dialog: him. Drove right into them."
dialog: 
text: Then his gaze locks on her. She doesn't know what he's
dialog: talking about.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: I knew Bert, you know. He treated
dialog: me for years. That's how I met
dialog: Doug--the clown. He was so nuts
dialog: that it didn't take much to
dialog: convince him that killing you
dialog: would make him all better. Of
dialog: course, he was a loaded gun. He
dialog: came after me tonight, but...I
text: straightened him out.
dialog: 
text: His expression goes grim. Lynn can't absorb it, doesn't
dialog: understand any of it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: Don't worry, you can ask your dad
dialog: what I'm talking about when you
dialog: visit him in hell.
dialog: 
text: He raises the blade and rushes at her. She stumbles back,
text: shoving a tall lamp in his way. He trips over it and falls,
text: catching himself at the last second. He regains a measure of
text: his dignity, brushing at his pants as he stands.
dialog: 
text: It might be funny if it weren't for the huge knife in his
dialog: hand.
dialog: 
text: Lynn's trying to stay cool even though she's deathly
text: frightened of the way Phillip looks, the clown makeup
text: covering his face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Phillip. Listen to me. I'm your
dialog: friend. I want to help you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: Do you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: Then please...let me stab you.
text: He feints her way her again. She dodges around the side of
text: the sofa.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Phillip--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: Stop calling me that. My name is
dialog: Shane.
dialog: 
text: They are circling each other, the sofa a barrier between them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: Would you like to know why you're
dialog: so afraid of clowns?
dialog: 
text: She does, but she says nothing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
text: At the hospital, some vapid nurse
dialog: told you your parents were never
dialog: coming back so you started crying.
dialog: There was a clown at the hospital
text: trying to cheer up the kids that
dialog: day and...he came up behind you
dialog: and touched your shoulder. I guess
dialog: he was trying to make you smile.
dialog: But...you saw him and wouldn't
text: stop screaming bloody murder.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Isn't it interesting how that one
dialog: moment has shaped the rest of your
dialog: life?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: And you've been...following me all
dialog: these years?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
text: Lynn's expression says just how nuts that is.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: And Amanda? Julie? Even Nicky?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: FUCK you, Lynn! What about my
dialog: parents? What about ME?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: What about you?
text: She surprises him by moving a little closer, her face showing
dialog: sympathy and kindness.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Phillip...you're nuts.
dialog: 
text: She punches him square in the face. He's shocked, and hurt,
text: falls back on his ass as blood starts to gush from his nose.
dialog: 
text: Lynn turns and runs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OUTSIDE
dialog: 
text: She rushes to the car, fumbling at her keyring for the car
text: key. She gets to her door, still sorting through her keys and
text: naturally, she drops them.
dialog: 
text: Phillip bursts out the door, furious. He sees her car, that
text: she's not in it. He turns to look the other direction as she
text: stands up with the right key in her hand.
dialog: 
text: He hears, turns toward her. Too late--she's unlocked the door
text: and slid in. He rushes over as the car starts, leaping on the
text: hood as if he can stop her from getting away.
dialog: 
text: In reverse, she guns it.
dialog: 
text: Phillip slides off and hits the driveway painfully. Lynn has
text: braked her car short of the road. She puts it in park. Stares
text: at Phillip as he slowly stands up.
dialog: 
text: She looks at Nicky in the back seat, still asleep.
text: Something's going through her mind but it's hard to tell what
dialog: it is.
dialog: 
text: Phillip is walking toward the car now. Twenty feet away.
dialog: 
text: Lynn puts her hand on the shift lever. Takes a good look at
text: the letters. R D N 1 2 3. Reverse takes her away from the
text: nightmare walking toward her.
dialog: 
text: Phillip is fifteen feet away and closing.
dialog: 
text: Lynn pulls the lever down. Was it one click or two?
dialog: 
text: She stomps on a pedal and her car surges forward. Phillip has
text: time to raise the knife before the car hits him, tossing him
text: back into the yard like a rag doll.
dialog: 
text: She checks on Nicky--still buckled up and unbelievably still
text: asleep. Back to front where Phillip lies in an unmoving heap.
dialog: 
text: Lynn lays her head on the steering wheel in utter exhaustion
text: as SIRENS can be heard approaching.

scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The PHONE RINGS, and Lynn bolts upright in bed. She snatches
text: it off the hook.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Hello?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS (PHONE)
dialog: Lynn? Thank God you answered. I
dialog: don't want you to panic--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: What? What's happened?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: Look, I've got men on the way,
dialog: they'll be there any second.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: What is it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: (exhales)
dialog: Doug Richardson--the clown...he
dialog: escaped from the prison. I'm sure
text: he's headed out of state as fast
dialog: as he can go, but I'm sending men
dialog: over there just to be safe. I want
dialog: you to stay calm...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: When?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE PETERS
dialog: We're not sure, we--
dialog: 
text: She's already put the phone down and is moving down the hall
text: toward Nicholas' room. Detective Peters keeps talking, but
text: his voice soon fades away to nothing.
dialog: 
text: She passes Nicholas' room and goes to the front door. Checks
text: the locks. Still locked, the security chain latched.
dialog: 
text: Relieved, she moves back to Nicholas' room. His door is half-
text: closed, and pitch dark inside.
dialog: 
text: She pushes the door open, but it's still too dark to see
text: Nicholas' bed.
text: Lynn flicks on the light.
dialog: 
text: The light comes on for an instant and immediately blows out.
text: But in the snapshot flash Lynn sees the clown standing in
text: front of her son's bed looking down on him, and at the flick
text: of the switch, the clown begins to turn her way.
dialog: 
text: The room is pitch-black before their eyes can meet.
dialog: 
text: Lynn's fear is all-consuming. She unwittingly moves back
text: against the wall, staring into the dark gaping hole into her
text: son's room, so suddenly a mouth into madness.
dialog: 
text: Too paralyzed to scream, Lynn stares into the darkness,
text: waiting for the clown to appear.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON THE DOORWAY
dialog: 
text: At any second, the clown's horrid face will loom out of the
text: black, like a floating head, leering at her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON LYNN
dialog: 
text: Lynn's lip trembles. She can't blink. Fear grips her every
dialog: muscle.
dialog: 
text: CLOSER ON THE DOORWAY
