dialog: On credit sequence...
speaker_heading: AN ARM
text: stretched out. Long, alabaster white. Beautiful. A WASH
text: CLOTH enters frame. Starts washing the arm with long, tender
dialog: strokes.
text: A TUMBLE OF HAIR
dialog: 
text: thick and auburn. Being gently washed.
speaker_heading: FINGERNAILS
text: being clipped with a shiny nail clipper. Short. Uniform.
dialog: Tidy.
speaker_heading: EYEBROWS
text: brown with a touch of gold. A BRUSH comes into view.
text: Brushes against the eyebrow hair, then back again. Against.
dialog: Then back again.
speaker_heading: PANTY-HOSE
text: pulled gingerly off a long leg. Folded neatly. The wash
text: cloth begins between the toes. Warm, soapy water.
speaker_heading: HAIR
text: now dry. The HAND appears with a comb. Pulls down through
text: the thick tresses.
text: It is only now that we see the hand is wearing a SURGICAL
speaker_heading: GLOVE.
text: The gloved hand holds up the comb and pulls stray hairs from
text: it. Places them in a big, clear, plastic bag. In the bag we
text: see the panty-hose, a folded flower dress, the nail
text: clippings.
text: Goes back to combing. Comes across a knot and yanks the comb
text: through. The HEAD rolls over to us. Her face is bruised,
text: her eyes blank. She is lying on the floor.
dialog: Dead.
dialog: End of credit sequence.
scene_heading: INT. BUSH PLANE - THE KILBUCK MOUNTAINS, ALASKA - DAY
text: The loud THRUM of a bush plane. We CLOSE ON a small, cloudy
text: window. Through it we see an endless expanse of pine trees.
speaker_heading: HAP (O.S.)
dialog: Jesus. Just look at all that.
text: PULL BACK to reveal HAP ECKHART and WILL DORMER sitting side
text: by side. Hap's at the window. Greying moustache, a little
text: pudgy, wearing a brown suit. Holding a folded over Seattle
dialog: Times.
speaker_heading: HAP (cont'd)
dialog: I thought we had a population problem.
dialog: Everyone should just move up here.
dialog: (taps window)
dialog: Just look at it, Will.
text: Will's eyes remain on the file on his lap.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I don't need to look at it.
text: Will Dormer. Tall, handsome, expensively tailored suit.
text: Snakeskin cowboy boots. There's both a magnetism and a
text: distance to him. An intense mixture. Hap glances at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAP
dialog: Nothing wrong with smelling the roses.
text: Will looks up. We see the trace of a thick, ropy SCAR by his
text: Adam's apple. There's tension between him and Hap, just
text: below the surface. He taps the file.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Tell that to her, partner.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON THE FILE
text: a stack of 8x10 PHOTOGRAPHS. Of the dead girl. Her eyes
text: puffed up from bruises. The whites bloody. Contusions along
text: her breasts and shoulders.
speaker_heading: PILOT (O.S.)
dialog: Detective?
text: The PILOT's looking back at Will. Wearing a leather red
dialog: baron hat.
speaker_heading: PILOT (cont'd)
dialog: Better check your belts. We'll be
text: landing in about fifteen minutes.
text: Will nods. The plane lurches. The file falls to the floor
text: and the photographs scatter. The pilot catches a glimpse of
text: them. Looks at Will.
scene_heading: EXT. BUSH PLANE - CONTINUOUS
text: The small yellow plane veers left. Clears a mountain top and
text: gives view to the spectacular Alaskan coastline. The green
text: of the Bering sea, the blanket of pine trees, the jagged rock
text: of the beaches. Enormous.
scene_heading: EXT. LANDING STRIP - OUTSIDE NIGHTMUTE - DAY
text: A SIGN swinging in the wind: Nightmute, Alaska. Halibut
dialog: Fishing Capital of the World!
text: PULL BACK to reveal it hanging from the eave of a small,
text: corrugated building. The "airport." Nothing else for miles
dialog: around.
text: A mud-splattered Jeep Cherokee pulls up next to it. Brakes
text: SCREECHING. A YOUNG WOMAN hops out. About 23. Petite with
text: short, brown hair.
text: Peers up at the sky. Brightens at the sight of the BUSH
text: PLANE coming in for landing. Smooths down her down vest.
text: Making sure the GOLD SHIELD on her belt's visible. Nervous.
dialog: Excited.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN (O.S.)
dialog: Eleanor?
text: ELLIE BURR turns. Shields her eyes from the sun. An OLD MAN
text: hosing down the side of the building.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Hey, Mr. Angstrom!
speaker_heading: MR. ANGSTROM
dialog: What're you doing here?
text: Ellie puffs up.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Police business.
speaker_heading: MR. ANGSTROM
dialog: Police business?
text: The old man screws up his face, confused.
speaker_heading: MR. ANGSTROM (cont'd)
dialog: Didn't you used to baby-sit for us?
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: I don't babysit any more, Mr. Angstrom.
dialog: Just made detective three weeks ago.
text: A CAT jumps down off the roof. Angstrom sprays it.
speaker_heading: MR. ANGSTROM
text: Boy, Charlie must be short-handed down at
dialog: the station.
text: Ellie, used to not being taken seriously. Turns back to THE
text: ROAR of the bush plane as it taxis down the strip. Coming to
text: a stop. She hurries over as the door swings open and...
text: WILL DORMER steps down. Slipping on his sunglasses.
text: Scanning the nothingness around him. Spots the swinging
dialog: sign.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: "Halibut fishing capital of the world."
text: Hap, right behind him. Rubs his neck.
speaker_heading: HAP
dialog: This ought to be interesting.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: (over the engine)
dialog: Detective Dormer!
text: They look down. Ellie reaches up and takes Will's bag. Then
text: his hand. Shakes it vigorously.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (cont'd)
dialog: It's a huge honor to meet you! Ellie
dialog: Burr. I'm here to take you to the
dialog: station!
text: Will motions to Hap.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: My partner...
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Detective Eckhart! I know! Welcome to
dialog: Nightmute!
text: She leads them away from the plane. Takes Will's briefcase.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: I just want to say how incredible it is
dialog: to have you working with us, Detective
dialog: Dormer. I've followed all your cases.
dialog: Theodore Dineli, Frank and Casey
dialog: Prud'homme, the Port Angeles shootings...
text: Opens the back of the Jeep. Puts the bags inside.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (cont'd)
dialog: ...And especially the Leland Street
dialog: Murders. That was my case study at the
dialog: Academy.
text: The Pilot walks by. Taps her on the shoulder.
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: Tell your dad the game's gonna start late
dialog: this week, Ellie.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Sure thing, Spence.
text: She looks back at Will. Can't help but focus in on his scar.
text: Touches her own smooth neck. In awe.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (cont'd)
dialog: That's where Ronald Langley cut you in
text: the basement of his father's house on 325
dialog: Leland, isn't it?
text: Will smiles, taken aback by this girl's exuberance.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You did your homework, Officer.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Actually...
text: She throws a quick glance at Angstrom. Out of ear-shot.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: I just made detective three weeks ago.
scene_heading: EXT. NIGHTMUTE POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY
text: The Cherokee parked next to a police car outside a plain, one-
text: storey building. The Nightmute Police Department. A totem
text: pole stands out front.
speaker_heading: CHIEF NYBACK (O.S.)
dialog: Will Dormer!
scene_heading: INT. CHIEF CHARLES NYBACK'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
text: Nightmute Police Chief CHARLES NYBACK gets up from behind his
text: desk with a big smile. Ruddy, red hair sprinkled with grey,
text: Nyback wears a faded army sweater over his uniform.
speaker_heading: CHIEF NYBACK
dialog: I'll be damned!
text: Limps from behind his desk and gives Will a shake and a slap
text: on the back.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (warmly)
dialog: How you doing, Charlie?
text: Nyback shakes Hap's hand. A reunion.
speaker_heading: HAP
dialog: Hey, Charlie.
speaker_heading: CHIEF NYBACK
dialog: Christ. I haven't seen you boys since...
speaker_heading: WILL
text: Just after Leland Street.
speaker_heading: CHIEF NYBACK
dialog: What's that, then?
speaker_heading: HAP
dialog: Eight years.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Seven years.
speaker_heading: CHIEF NYBACK
dialog: Seven years? Where does it all go? That
dialog: was some amazing time, though, wasn't it?
text: Looks at Will. Down at his boots.
speaker_heading: CHIEF NYBACK (cont'd)
dialog: You haven't changed a bit, Will.
text: Will. Looks at Nyback's gut.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You have, Chief.
text: They LAUGH. Eyes twinkling.
speaker_heading: CHIEF NYBACK
dialog: I knew that was coming. I deserve it.
text: He starts back over to his desk. Notices Ellie still
text: standing by the door. Points to Will.
speaker_heading: CHIEF NYBACK (cont'd)
dialog: Pay attention to this man, Ellie. He'll
dialog: teach you how to be a great cop.
text: Ellie straightens. Smiles. Looks over at Will.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: CHIEF NYBACK
dialog: That's all, for now.
text: Ellie, realises they want to be alone.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Oh. Right. Okay.
text: Backs out. Quietly closing the door behind her. Will
text: unbuttons his jacket. Takes a seat.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Nice kid.
speaker_heading: CHIEF NYBACK
dialog: (sits with a SIGH)
dialog: Got a love affair with police work.
dialog: Drives me crazy with it.
text: Will surveys the fishing poles leaning against the gun rack.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Keeping you busy up here, Charlie?
text: Hap picks up a cheap trophy. Reads the base.
speaker_heading: HAP
dialog: "2nd prize Great Kodiak Salmon Catch."
speaker_heading: CHIEF NYBACK
dialog: I told you seven years ago this was a
dialog: stepping stone to retirement.
text: Nyback nods to Hap's Seattle Times. The headline: "Deeper
dialog: Investigation into Special Branch"...
speaker_heading: CHIEF NYBACK (cont'd)
dialog: Looks like it's a good time for you to
dialog: get up here, too. With all the bad
text: business going on down at Special Branch.
text: Will and Hap share a look. No more joking. Hap folds over
dialog: the paper.
speaker_heading: CHIEF NYBACK (cont'd)
dialog: Just five bad apples so far?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: So far.
speaker_heading: CHIEF NYBACK
dialog: What's the D.A. got them on?
speaker_heading: WILL
text: Four unwarranted shootings, witness
dialog: intimidation, and cocaine theft.
text: Nyback winces.
speaker_heading: CHIEF NYBACK
dialog: How about you? How you faring?
speaker_heading: HAP
dialog: They're all over us, Charlie.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: They're all over everybody.
speaker_heading: HAP
dialog: I.A.'s calling themselves the "Corruption
dialog: Task Force." Can you believe that?
dialog: Trying to root out any mistakes or
dialog: "oversights" any other Detectives may
dialog: have made over the years. They're
text: turning it into a witch hunt. Something
dialog: on the news about it practically every
dialog: night.
text: Nyback pulls a stack of messages from his desk.
speaker_heading: CHIEF NYBACK
dialog: Got a bunch of messages here from some
dialog: guy named Warfield.
text: Hap tosses a glance over at Will.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: That's I.A.'s pit bull.
speaker_heading: CHIEF NYBACK
dialog: Wants me to keep him posted on all your
dialog: movements up here.
text: Nyback turns and ceremoniously drops the messages into the
dialog: trash.
speaker_heading: CHIEF NYBACK (cont'd)
dialog: I'm just glad Buck could spare you a
dialog: couple of weeks. Take you out of the
dialog: frenzy. I gotta tell you, though, I sure
dialog: don't miss big city police work. Not
dialog: that I was ever a great detective. But
dialog: up here there's no Bureaucracy. No
text: Public Relations. No blurred lines.
dialog: Just good guys and bad guys. Simple.
text: A cloud passes over his face.
speaker_heading: CHIEF NYBACK (cont'd)
dialog: Except for this.
text: Holds up a file. The name written on the lip: KAY CONNELL.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER
text: Nyback leads Will and Hap down a hallway. Crooked plaques
text: and black-and-white pictures line the walls.
speaker_heading: CHIEF NYBACK
dialog: Couldn't get a thing from the body. Not
dialog: a trace. Town's never dealt with
dialog: anything like this before.
text: They turn a corner and stop at a door. Will glances up:
text: MOOSE ANTLERS hanging over it.
speaker_heading: CHIEF NYBACK (cont'd)
dialog: I've briefed everybody about your coming.
dialog: They know to follow your lead.
text: Nyback opens the door onto...
scene_heading: INT. BULLPEN - NIGHTMUTE PD - CONTINUOUS
text: ...the bullpen of Nightmute PD. Wooden desks, a couple
text: computers, a jumbled corkboard, an impressive gun cabinet. A
text: RADIO's playing.
text: Three MEN look over. A young uniformed cop and two guys with
text: heavy facial hair, Timberland boots, and flannel shirts. One
text: of them's part Inuit. Ellie sits in the back. Reaches over
text: to turn off the radio.
text: Will and Hap stand in the doorway. Sticking out like sore
text: thumbs in their suits. Nyback jerks his thumb towards them.
speaker_heading: CHIEF NYBACK
text: This is Detective Dormer and his partner
text: Detective Eckhart. On loan from Buck
dialog: Lundgard, Seattle Robbery and Homicide
dialog: Special Branch. They'll be helping with
dialog: the Connell case.
text: The Inuit, FRED DUGGAR, snorts. Takes his feet of the desk.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Helping?
speaker_heading: CHIEF NYBACK
dialog: (ignoring him)
dialog: Anything they need to see, you show them;
dialog: anywhere they want to go, you take them.
dialog: (nods to Fred)
dialog: This is Detective Fred Duggar. He's been
text: leading the investigation up to now.
text: Will puts out his hand.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Detective...
text: Fred tugs at his dark handlebar moustache. Stands.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Suppose you want to see the body.
scene_heading: EXT. NIGHTMUTE POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY
text: Fred steps out of the station, pulls on a baseball cap.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: We can walk from here.
text: He heads off across the parking lot. Will and Hap exchange a
dialog: glance.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Guess that's what they call Alaskan
dialog: hospitality.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (O.S.)
dialog: Don't worry about him...
text: They turn. Ellie's come up behind them. Looks over at the
text: hunched figure to Fred.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (cont'd)
dialog: He's just mad 'cause you're taking over.
text: Fred stops up ahead. Sees her. Annoyed.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Ellie! Go type something!
scene_heading: INT. NIGHTMUTE MORGUE - LATER
text: CLOSE ON a faucet. A bead of water, quivering at the mouth.
dialog: Falls with a BLIP!
speaker_heading: CORONER (O.S.)
dialog: Did a fundascopic examination and found
text: papilledema and petechiae of the retina.
text: PULL BACK to reveal Will, Hap, and the COUNTY CORONER
text: standing by a stainless steel table. The naked body of KAY
text: CONNELL is laid out before them. Fred hangs back.
text: The coroner tugs at her surgical gloves. She's in her late
dialog: seventies.
speaker_heading: CORONER (cont'd)
dialog: Clear cause of death was herniation of
text: the brain stem due to intracerebral
dialog: hemorrhage.
speaker_heading: HAP
text: Beaten to death.
speaker_heading: CORONER
text: Beaten to death.
text: Will points to the bruises on the body's shoulders and
dialog: breasts.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: What about these contusions?
speaker_heading: CORONER
dialog: Superficial.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Any signs of rape?
speaker_heading: CORONER
dialog: None.
text: The coroner starts to cover the body with a sheet.
speaker_heading: CORONER (cont'd)
dialog: She was a nice girl. Played flute with
dialog: my granddaughter.
text: Will stays her hand.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Wait.
text: He pulls the sheet back down. Studying the body of Kay
text: Connell. Starts walking slowly around the table. In his
text: element. The faucet drips. Drips. Drips.
text: He bends down to smell her hair.
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: He washed her hair.
text: Takes a handful and lets it fall from his fingers.
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: Combed it.
text: Continues around the table. Picks up one of her hands.
text: Examines her fingers, her nails.
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
text: Cleaned under her fingernails. Clipped
dialog: them.
text: Continues down around her feet. Checks between her first and
dialog: second toes.
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: Toes, too.
dialog: (to Fred)
dialog: You found nothing on the body?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: No fibers, skin flakes, hairs...
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Like I said, no. We know about those
dialog: things up here.
text: Will stands there. Looking down at the body. Slim. Young.
text: Beautiful. Skin like marble.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: He knew exactly what we'd be looking for.
dialog: Made sure to cover up all his tracks.
speaker_heading: HAP
dialog: Even the best make mistakes.
text: Will looks up and locks eyes with his partner.
scene_heading: INT. PIONEER LODGE - NIGHTMUTE - NIGHT
text: Will and Hap enter the lobby of the Pioneer Lodge. Big stone
text: fireplace and heavy ceiling beams. MOOSE ANTLERS mounted
text: above reception. They put their bags down by the desk. Look
dialog: around.
speaker_heading: RACHEL (O.S.)
dialog: Lower forty-eight.
text: They turn. RACHEL CLEMENT stands in a doorway behind the
text: desk. Dunking a teabag into a mug. Long dark hair and
dialog: intelligent eyes.
speaker_heading: HAP
dialog: Lower forty-eight?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You're not from here. I can tell by your
dialog: walk.
speaker_heading: HAP
dialog: Oh? And how's that?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Unsure.
text: Hap smiles at her. Will checks his watch.
speaker_heading: WILL
text: Detectives Will Dormer and Hap Eckhart.
dialog: There should be a reservation for us.
text: Rachel looks at him. Goes to a small file box on the desk.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (to Hap)
dialog: Your friend's all business.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I'm always all business.
text: He glances out the window. It's as bright as day.
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: Is it really 9:30?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (nods)
dialog: Alaskan summers. Hope you're an easy
dialog: sleeper. It'll be like this all night.
text: She hands them two cards.
speaker_heading: RACHEL (cont'd)
dialog: Sign here.
scene_heading: INT. WILL'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Will's taken off his jacket and is unpacking. The room is
text: sparse and creaky. Bed dips in the middle. He hangs a
text: jacket in the armoire then returns to his suitcase. Pulls
text: out his SMITH AND WESSON 45.
text: Lays it on the bedside table. Takes out a shoulder holster.
text: A back holster. A handful of shells. Lays them on the
text: table. Then a small SMITH AND WESSON 39/13 9MM. Checks the
dialog: magazine.
text: There's a KNOCK on the adjoining door.
speaker_heading: HAP (O.S.)
dialog: Me.
dialog: Will SLAPS the magazine back.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Come on in.
text: Hap opens the door. A glimpse into his room: family PICTURES
text: on his bedside table - a WOMAN and three teenage GIRLS.
speaker_heading: HAP
dialog: See you have the same decor as my room.
text: He walks over to the big window. It overlooks the harbor.
text: Big, snow-capped mountains in the distance. One lone TUGBOAT
text: in the harbor towing a freighter.
speaker_heading: HAP (cont'd)
dialog: Same view, too.
dialog: (looks out)
dialog: I've been watching that tugboat for the
dialog: last half hour. So small, pulling all
dialog: that weight.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We have to talk, Will.
text: Will reaches into his suitcase. Pulls out a shirt.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: What do you want to talk about?
speaker_heading: HAP
dialog: You know what about.
text: Will throws him a look.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: We'll talk when we get back to Seattle.
speaker_heading: HAP
dialog: When's that, a week? Two weeks?...
dialog: (heads over to him)
dialog: We have to figure out a plan of action
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You know my plan of action.
speaker_heading: HAP
dialog: To do nothing.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: HAP
dialog: Dammit, Will. Warfield had me locked up
dialog: in his office again for five hours
dialog: yesterday. Five hours. Asking all kinds
dialog: of questions...
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: He's asking everybody questions.
speaker_heading: HAP
text: But he's zeroing in on me. On us.
text: Everyone's talking about it.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: He's just rattling your cage.
speaker_heading: HAP
dialog: Well, I gotta tell you. With a wife,
text: three kids, and a pension plan in the
text: balance, it's rattling hard.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: We say nothing. It goes away. Simple as
dialog: that.
text: Will goes back to his suitcase. Hap follows. A thin film of
text: sweat on his upper lip.
speaker_heading: HAP
dialog: (lowers voice)
dialog: Look. We've tampered with evidence.
dialog: We've pushed witnesses. We've planted
text: shit. And they're sniffing around like
dialog: dogs. Especially on the Dobbs case...
text: Will flares up. Struck a nerve. Turns to his partner.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Weston Dobbs killed an eight year-old boy
text: and left him hanging in the basement like
dialog: a piece of meat. You remember that?
speaker_heading: HAP
dialog: You know I remember that.
speaker_heading: WILL
text: One word to I.A. and he walks.
speaker_heading: HAP
dialog: Maybe not. We could talk to Buck...
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: No way.
speaker_heading: HAP
dialog: Cut some kind of a deal. I heard that's
dialog: what Flynn's doing...
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Mike Flynn's a dirty cop, Hap! We are
dialog: nothing like Mike Flynn. We did what we
dialog: needed to do to make sure that son-of-
dialog: bitch Dobbs paid for what he did. And
dialog: every bastard like him. We say one word
dialog: about it and every case we ever brought
dialog: in is going to blow wide open and they'll
dialog: all walk. Every last one. And I am not
dialog: going to let that happen. No deals. No
dialog: compromises. No discussions.
text: He grabs a hanger.
speaker_heading: HAP
dialog: Goddammit, Will. You grab on to
dialog: something and you don't let it go.
text: He takes out a handkerchief. Wipes his brow.
speaker_heading: HAP
dialog: I don't know if it's because you think
dialog: it's the right thing to do or because
dialog: your pride won't let you do anything
dialog: else. I can't tell any more.
dialog: (steps back)
dialog: But I can tell you one thing. I'm
dialog: getting too old for this cowboy cop
dialog: stuff. Breaking the rules. Cleaning up
dialog: messes. We're a dying breed, Will.
dialog: You're a dying breed. I.A., the D.A.,
dialog: all those reporters - they don't care
dialog: what you did at Leland Street seven years
dialog: ago. They don't care that you've made
dialog: this your life. They don't care about
dialog: getting the bad guy...
text: Will turns on his partner, eyes burning.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I care.
text: The partners, lock eyes. Years of working together. A
text: thousand things unsaid. Hap reaches for the door.
speaker_heading: HAP (cont'd)
dialog: They're watching us, Will. Like it or
dialog: not. They're watching us.
scene_heading: INT. WILL'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Will's asleep. Kay Connell's folder open on his chest. It's
text: dark in his room, quiet. Suddenly the shade on his window
text: quivers and SNAPS up, flooding the room with light.
text: Will's eyes pop open. He rolls over to look at the clock:
text: 3:15. Squinting, he gets up and walks over to the window.
text: We can see the rest of his scar. Runs down deep across his
dialog: sternum.
text: He yanks the shade back down. It bucks, then settles.
text: Satisfied, Will returns to bed. Plumps the pillow, pulls the
text: blanket up around him. Closes his eyes.
text: The shade lurches halfway. Then SNAPS back up. Light pours
text: in. Will's eyes open.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You got to be kidding me.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHTMUTE - DAY
text: Will jogs along in a Sonics sweatshirt, a ring of sweat
text: around his collar. He looks out over the harbor. Fishing
text: boats coming in with their early morning haul. More halibut.
text: He checks his watch. Slows to a walk. Looks up and sees...
text: Ellie Burr standing on the front steps of the Pioneer Lodge.
text: Smiles. Holds up some car keys.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Fred wants us to meet him at the
dialog: Connell's.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. JEEP CHEROKEE - DAY
text: Ellie driving. A hula-girl, swinging from the rear-view
text: mirror. Will in the passenger seat. Wearing a crisp suit.
text: Ellie hands him a take-out bag.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Brought you a bear claw. Just in case
dialog: you were hungry.
text: Will takes the bag. Looks inside. Yikes.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (cont'd)
dialog: Local delicacy.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Think I'll pass.
text: He puts the bag on the dash. Looks out the window.
text: Nightmute's main street. A line of shops. Undistinguished
text: Town Hall. Elementary school up on a hill. Sign out front:
dialog: Sign-ups for Midnight Little League!
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: What kind of calls you get around here?
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Oh. You know. Small-time stuff.
dialog: Nothing like what you must get. Mostly
dialog: drinking-related problems. Domestic
text: abuse. Barroom fights. Stuff like that.
text: She shifts down. Takes a steep turn.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (cont'd)
dialog: In the summer months it's pretty quiet.
dialog: That's when there's work out on the
dialog: boats. The rest of the year, though...
text: They pass a MAN walking along the road. Gnarled walking
text: stick. Ellie calls out the window.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (cont'd)
dialog: Hey, there, Joe!
text: JOE waves. They pass.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (cont'd)
dialog: That's Joe Willy. Took his family
dialog: hostage in November. That was the most
dialog: exciting thing that happened last year.
dialog: I wasn't there, though.
dialog: (grinds gear)
dialog: Chief barely lets me handle anything
text: above a misdemeanor.

speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Don't give misdemeanors a bad rap.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: But they're so boring. All small stuff.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: It's all about the small stuff. Small
dialog: lies. Small mistakes. Small oversights.
dialog: People give themselves away in a traffic
dialog: violation just as much as they do in a
dialog: murder case. It's human nature.
text: He looks over. Ellie's listening intently.
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: Aren't you going to write that down?
text: Ellie, searching her pockets for something to write with...
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Let me just...
text: Stops. Looks over. Realises Will's teasing her.
scene_heading: EXT. CONNELL HOUSE - DAY
text: A small ranch house. Aluminum siding. FLOWERS piled up by
text: the front door. TEDDY BEARS. RIBBONS. Left by well-wishers.
speaker_heading: MRS. CONNELL (O.S.)
dialog: I haven't tidied up, since Fred told me
dialog: not to touch anything.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - CONNELL HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

text: back, opens the door to her daughter's room. Looks at Will.
scene_heading: MRS. CONNELL
dialog: I don't believe in keeping a child's room
text: like a shrine.
text: Will heads into the room. Hap follows. A palpable
text: uneasiness between them. Fred and Ellie stand in the
text: doorway. Mrs. Connell turns to go.
scene_heading: INT. KAY CONNELL'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: A small bedroom. Pink shag carpeting and clouds painted on
text: the ceiling. Pictures cut from magazines pasted on the
text: walls. A stack of tapes and a boom box in the corner.
text: Will stands in the middle of the room. Taking it in.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Typical seventeen year-old.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: She went to a party Friday night?
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Down at a local dive the kids like to
dialog: hang out in.
text: Fred throws Ellie a look. "Kids?" She's practically a kid
text: herself. Will opens the top drawer of the bureau. Roots
text: beneath the panties.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: No diary.
text: On top of the bureau, a stack of photos. A couple torn up.
text: Kay Connell and a GIRL with white-blonde hair. Laughing.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: She left the party early. Friends said
text: she had a fight with her boyfriend and
dialog: stormed out.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: What time was that?
speaker_heading: FRED
text: Around twelve-thirty.
text: Hap picks up a bear on Kay's bed. A bell JINGLES when he
text: shakes it. Will crosses to a closet in the corner.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Who was the last one to see her alive?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Randy Stetz. Her boyfriend. We've
text: questioned him, searched his place.
dialog: Didn't find anything.
text: Will pulls a dress out of the closet. Small, black, elegant.
text: The tag's been cut out. He pulls out another, then another.
text: Feels the fabric.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: These are designer. Expensive.
dialog: (looks up)
dialog: Could Randy Stetz afford these?
text: Fred and Ellie exchange a look.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
text: He fixes boat engines.
text: Will looks around. Cheap wallpaper, torn window screens.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Well her mother didn't buy them for her.
speaker_heading: HAP
dialog: What are we thinking?
text: Will reaches over to a heart-shaped box on the bedside table.
text: Pulls out a pretty gold necklace. Holds it up.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Kay Connell had an admirer.
text: He hands the dresses to Ellie. Heads out of the room.
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: I want to talk to the boyfriend.
scene_heading: INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
text: CLOSE ON a hand squeezing a shoulder. Hard.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You don't seem all that sad.
text: The shoulder jerks away. PULL BACK to reveal RANDY STETZ
text: sitting at a wooden table in an interrogation room. Longish
text: blond hair, wearing a Metallica t-shirt, trying like hell to
text: grow a moustache.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: I haven't had a chance! You fuckers been
dialog: all over my back since Monday!
text: He takes out a cigarette. It's bent. He lights it. Hap
text: sits opposite.
speaker_heading: HAP
dialog: You know smoking stunts your growth.
text: Randy throws him a look.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Yeah, okay, fat-ass.
speaker_heading: HAP
dialog: (smiles at Will)
text: More Alaskan hospitality.
text: Will goes over to a coffee machine. Pours a cup.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Did you love her?
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Kay Connell. Did you love her?
text: Randy flicks his ash. Shrugs.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Sure. She was nice.
text: Will turns with his coffee.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: "She was nice." Wow. That makes me all
dialog: soft inside. Ever occur to you she
dialog: didn't love you back?
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You heard me that time.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: She loved me. She wanted to see me every
dialog: night.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: But she was seeing someone else on the
dialog: side.
text: Randy glares.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: I don't know what you're fucking talking
dialog: about.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Friday night, at the party - what'd you
dialog: fight about?
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Stuff.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: What kind of stuff?
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Just stuff. I don't fucking remember.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: The other guy?
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: I told you I don't remember.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: After that she left the party to go to
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: How should I know?...
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Ran like hell to go to him...
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Fuck you, man! - I'm sick of all your
dialog: fucking cop questions...
text: Will suddenly hurls his coffee cup and grabs Randy up by the
text: collar. Nose to nose.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Now you listen to me, you little shit.
dialog: This fuck-the-world-Metallica-t-shirt
dialog: crap may work with your mamma, but it
dialog: doesn't work with me. You got mad at
dialog: your girlfriend because she was seeing
dialog: someone else. You want to be the last
dialog: person who saw her alive or are you going
dialog: to tell me who that is?
text: Randy's lip curls. Red-faced.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You don't know.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: She didn't tell me.
text: Disgusted, Will shoves Randy back into his seat.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER
text: Will walking out of the interrogation room. Ellie joins him.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: He's a little surly, isn't he?
text: Will smooths back his hair. Checks his tie.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Just a little.
text: He reaches into his pocket and pulls out the gold necklace
text: from Kay's room. Hands it to her.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I want you to check this out, Ellie.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: We already did.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Do it again.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: But there wasn't any...
text: Will stops. Ellie stops. Will puts a hand on her shoulder.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: The small things - remember? The second
dialog: you're about to dismiss something - look
text: at it again.
text: Ellie smiles, teasing.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: You want me to write that down?
text: Will, has to smile. She's quick. Looks down the hall. A
text: bearded GUY on crutches. Ellie follows his gaze.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Who's that?
speaker_heading: ELLIE
text: The bartender at Darrow's. He was there
dialog: Friday night.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Good. He's up next.
text: Will heads over to him. Ellie watches his neck. Her hand
text: closing over the necklace.
scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT - PIONEER LODGE - NIGHT
text: The Pioneer Lodge restaurant. Small, dark wood, a RADIO
text: playing something between Bluegrass and Folk. Some rough-
text: looking GUYS at the bar. Throwing looks over at...

speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (reading)
dialog: Halibut Calabrese. Halibut Olympia.
dialog: Halibut Cajun Style. Halibut fish and
dialog: chips...
text: He puts down his menu. Reaches for his drink.
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: Can't wait to see what's for dessert.
speaker_heading: HAP
dialog: At least there's variety.
text: Will drains his drink. Locks eyes with a big GUY over at the
text: bar. Beer froth on his moustache.
speaker_heading: WILL
text: Looks like the natives are restless.
speaker_heading: HAP
dialog: Will?
text: Will looks back at his partner. Hap's fidgeting with the end
text: of his tie.
speaker_heading: HAP (cont'd)
dialog: I think, I think I'm gonna talk to Buck
dialog: when we get back to Seattle.
text: A cold flash down Will's spine.
speaker_heading: HAP
dialog: I wish I could stick it out like you. I
dialog: just, with Trish and the kids...
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Don't do this, Hap...
text: Hap avoids his eyes.
speaker_heading: HAP
dialog: I'm thinking I could get off with
dialog: probation. Keep half my pension. That's
dialog: all I want.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (hisses)
dialog: Goddammit, Hap. Think about what you're
dialog: doing...
speaker_heading: HAP
dialog: You don't have to be involved, Will.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You tell Buck and I'm involved whether I
dialog: like it or not...
speaker_heading: RACHEL (O.S.)
dialog: Ready to order?
text: The men look up, interrupted. Rachel is standing by the
text: table with a pad. Hap tries to recover with a big smile.
speaker_heading: HAP
dialog: Hey - you do everything around here?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Just about.
text: Will stands abruptly. Eyes on Hap. Trying not to explode.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I'll just have another Scotch in my room.
dialog: (turns to Rachel)
dialog: If you don't mind.
text: Just then, his cell phone RINGS.
scene_heading: INT. BULLPEN - NIGHTMUTE PD - NIGHT
text: Will bursts into the bullpen. Hap behind.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Where is it?
text: Ellie, Fred, and a couple other GUYS huddled around a desk.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Over here.
text: Will and Hap head over to them. One of the younger guys,
text: FARRELL, intimidated by Will's presence. Tucks his shirt
text: into his dirty jeans.
text: They part to reveal a BLUE KNAPSACK laying on the desk. Mud
text: spots all over it. An embroidered daisy. Will examines it.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: We're sure it's hers?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Has her books in it.
speaker_heading: HAP
dialog: What about prints?
text: Ellie shakes her head, unfortunately not. Will reaches into
text: the bag. Pulls out two text books.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Biology and Algebra.
text: He shoves the books towards one of the guys.
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: Find out who she studied with.
text: He continues through the bag. Pulls out a little plastic bag
text: with "Hello Kittys" all over it. Dumps out the contents.
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: Make-up.
text: Looks up at Fred.
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: Find out where she bought it.
text: Fred looks at him. Not happy with make-up duty. Will pulls
text: out a hair brush. Hands it to Ellie.
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: Lab.
text: Next, a couple worn paperbacks.
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: (reading titles)
dialog: Otherwise Engaged, Murder at Sunset.
text: He looks up at the group.
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: Who here reads this kind of crap?
text: Farrell straightens.
speaker_heading: FARRELL
dialog: I read that kind of crap.
text: Will tosses them to him.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Read them. Tell me anything that strikes
dialog: you.
text: Down to the bottom of the bag. A Ziploc with a half-eaten
text: sandwich and an apple core. Will hands them to Ellie.
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: Lab.
text: Upends the knapsack. Scraps, paper clips, gum wrappers.
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: That's it.
text: Fred reaches for the knapsack.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: I'll stick it in the evidence locker...
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: No.
text: Will takes it, walks slowly over to the window. Thinking.
text: Twists the knapsack in his hands and looks out at the
dialog: 
text: TOTEM POLE standing tall outside. A black RAVEN alights on
text: top of it. Pecks at the air. Turns. Seems to look right at
dialog: Will.
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: We put it back where we found it.
text: Will turns to them.
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: You said it was a fishing cabin.
speaker_heading: FARRELL
dialog: Uh, right. About two miles outside of
dialog: town.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
text: On the beach.
text: Fred tightens his jaw.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Why are we taking it back?
text: Will ignores the question. Walks back towards them.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: This murder was in the papers, right?
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Yeah. All over.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Call all of them from here to Anchorage.
dialog: Tell them we now know that Kay Connell
text: left the party with a dark blue knapsack,
dialog: but we haven't recovered it yet.
dialog: (checks watch)
dialog: We can get it in by the morning editions.
text: He hands the bag to Farrell.
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: Fill this with random books. Make it
dialog: look heavy.
text: Will pulls out a handkerchief. Wipes the mud off his hands.
text: Taking his time. Finally turns to Fred.
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: It'll eat this guy alive if he thinks he
text: overlooked a detail.
scene_heading: EXT. ROCKY BEACH - OUTSIDE NIGHTMUTE - MORNING
speaker_heading: POV through BINOCULARS
text: A WOODEN CABIN comes into focus. Right by the water. Hasn't
text: been used in years. Weathered, slate roof. Algae growing up
dialog: the sides.
speaker_heading: HAP (O.S.)
dialog: Nice. Lighter than I remembered.
text: WILL lowers his binoculars. He's standing on the black rocky
text: beach. It's damp, slick, and cold. A fog's rolling in.
text: Hap and Farrell are sitting behind a cluster of rocks. A
text: couple paper bags and a megaphone. They're comparing guns.
speaker_heading: FARRELL
text: Glock 40. All plastic save the barrel
dialog: and firing pin. Never rusts. What do
dialog: you carry down in Seattle?
text: Hap reaches into his holster. Pulls out a...
speaker_heading: HAP
dialog: Smith and Wesson 45.
speaker_heading: FARRELL
dialog: Excellent!
text: Fred Duggar's standing on the other side of them. He's got a
text: pair of binoculars, too. They're staking out the cabin.
dialog: Been there a while.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (O.S.)
dialog: Brought some coffee...
text: Ellie appears with a thermos. Crouching down. Fred turns,
dialog: annoyed.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (answering for her)
dialog: I told her to come.
text: Fred shoots Will a look. Down at his cowboy boots. Will
text: gives him a smile.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Anything yet?
speaker_heading: WILL FRED
dialog: Nothing. Nothing.
text: Fred goes back to scanning, pissed.
speaker_heading: FARRELL
dialog: Maybe this guy doesn't read the papers.
speaker_heading: HAP
dialog: Or goes straight to the Sports Section.
text: Hap and Farrell chuckle. Hap unscrews the thermos. A cloud
text: of steam.
speaker_heading: HAP (cont'd)
dialog: Who gets first dibs?
dialog: (looks up at Will)
dialog: Will?
text: Will looks down at his partner. Holding out the thermos like
text: a weird kind of truce. Will turns away, rejecting it. A
text: swath of thick fog unfolds over the black rocks as...
text: Fred tenses.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: (looking through binoculars)
dialog: I see someone!
text: Hap and Farrell scramble to their feet. Will whips up his
text: binoculars.
text: POV THROUGH WILL'S BINOCULARS - a FIGURE making its way to
text: the cabin. Furtive.
speaker_heading: WILL (O.S.)
dialog: That's him.
text: Will lowers the binoculars. Snaps his fingers at the men.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: Fan out.
text: Fred, Farrell and Hap. Start spreading out. Ellie steps
text: up. Will looks back at her. Too dangerous.
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: Stay here, Ellie.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: But...
text: Will puts up his hand. She stops short. He plunges ahead.
text: Hap. Will. Farrell. Fred. Fanning out. Silent. Keeping
text: eye-contact. Will points to Farrell. Wants the megaphone.
text: Farrell, balancing on a rock, holds it out. Accidentally
text: keys it. The feedback SQUAWKS. Fuck.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: He's bolting!
text: POV THROUGH WILL'S BINOCULARS - the FIGURE, looking around,
text: running towards the cabin. Leaping from rock to rock.
text: WILL reaches for his Smith and Wesson.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Go! Go! Go!
text: The men jump into action. Race down towards the cabin.
text: Fred and Farrell, nimble over the wet rocks. Will and Hap,
text: harder going. Grab onto jagged edges, slip down small
text: crevices. Rocks sticking out every which way. The fog,
text: thick and white...
text: THE FIGURE disappears into the cabin.
text: FRED AND FARRELL leap up onto a tall boulder and jump down.
text: Run over to the door of the cabin, guns at the ready...
text: WILL rounds the boulder, Hap panting behind him. Joins Fred
text: and Farrell at the door.
text: Will levels his Smith and Wesson at the door, and with a nod
text: to Fred as he KICKS it in...
scene_heading: INT. FISHING CABIN - CONTINUOUS
text: ...the door CRACKS and swings in. The men rush inside.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Police!
text: They look around: Nothing. A few old nets, a wooden table
text: rotted through. No knapsack.
text: In the corner, a TRAP DOOR, left open. Will races over.
text: Looks down into the darkness.
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: Goddammit!
text: Turns and points to Farrell.
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: You! Head back up to base...
dialog: (to Fred)
dialog: You! Go right and follow along the
dialog: water...
dialog: (to Hap)
dialog: Hap! You go left...
text: The men nod.
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: Go!
text: They rush out the door and split directions. Will crouches
text: down by the trap door and...
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS
text: ...drops down into a dark, dank TUNNEL. Water dripping.
text: FOOTFALLS echoing. Will cocks his head. Left or right?
text: Starts sprinting down towards the lighter end of the tunnel,
text: his own footsteps bouncing against the tunnel walls. He
text: rounds a curve. Sound recedes...
scene_heading: EXT. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS
text: ...He exits the tunnel onto the rocky beach. Stops short.
speaker_heading: FOG
text: has enveloped everything - obscuring all vision, dulling all
text: sound. Like a strange dream. Eerie.
text: Will blinks against the thick whiteness. Strains to hear any
text: sound, anything. There's only the distant LAPPING of the
dialog: water.
text: He tightens his grip on his gun and plunges into the fog.
text: Quick, careful steps. Stumbles over a rock. Waves his gun
text: in defense. Eyes wide open like a blind man...
speaker_heading: SUDDENLY
text: a GUNSHOT. Off to the right. Will whips his head around.
scene_heading: EXT. UP ON THE BEACH - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Ellie, alone, jumps at the sound. Reaches for her weapon...
scene_heading: EXT. DOWN THE BEACH - CONTINUOUS
text: Will heads towards the sound. Reaching out for approaching
text: rocks. Scrambles over a small bank and finds...
text: FARRELL rolled up into a fetal position on the ground.
text: Clutching his thigh. Blood seeping through his fingers. He
text: looks up.
speaker_heading: FARRELL
dialog: Sorry about...
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Where is he?
dialog: Farrell can't answer that.
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: (impatient)
dialog: Where'd the shot come from?
text: Farrell lifts his bloody hand. Points off towards the water.
speaker_heading: FARRELL
dialog: Over there.
text: Will disappears back into the fog, leaving Farrell behind.
text: Clambers back down towards the water, pausing every few
text: seconds to listen, to adjust. Heart POUNDING. Blood
text: pumping. Like an animal tracking its prey. Leaps up onto a
dialog: plateau of rocks when...
speaker_heading: SUDDENLY
speaker_heading: a DARK FIGURE
text: flashes past him. The killer! Inches away. Will wheels
dialog: around...
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Freeze!
text: CRACK! Squeezes off a shot. Misses! Can't believe it.
text: Goes for another... Nothing! Jammed! The figure,
text: disappearing. Will tosses his Smith and Wesson, reaches
text: behind his back and whips out his SMITH 39/13...
scene_heading: EXT. UP ON THE BEACH - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Ellie, weapon drawn, making her way down the rocks. A HAND
text: suddenly grabs her arm.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Dammit, Ellie!...
text: Fred emerges from the fog.
speaker_heading: FRED (cont'd)
dialog: Put that thing away! Farrell's down!...
text: CRACK! as another shot rips through the air. Fred and Ellie
dialog: freeze.
scene_heading: EXT. DOWN BY THE WATER - MINUTES LATER
text: Fred and Ellie, skittering down the rocks. Getting closer to
text: the water. Hear a voice ring out...
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Hap!
text: The fog starts to dissipate. They reach the water to see...
speaker_heading: WILL DORMER
text: kneeling beside the body of his partner. Lying in the water.
text: Shot in the stomach. Blood dribbling from his mouth. Will
text: grabs him up by the collar.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Hap!
text: Starts shaking the limp body. Teeth clenched.
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: Hap!
text: Hap's head, rolls back. Mouth agape. Face white...
text: Will, rips off his tie. Presses it to the gaping wound...
text: trying to stop the bleeding...warm blood, pumping into the
dialog: water...
text: Ellie watches. Horrified. Fred races over to the body.
text: Feels for Hap's pulse.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Dormer...
text: Will, shaking Hap again. Jaw set. Eyes intense. Veins
text: popping up along his temples. Fred catches his shoulder.
speaker_heading: FRED (cont'd)
dialog: Dormer! He's gone.
text: Will looks up at Fred. His face contorts.
text: Suddenly leaps to his feet. Grabs a rock and hurls it
text: savagely into the thick fog.
scene_heading: INT. CHIEF CHARLES NYBACK'S OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Chief Nyback sits in his chair. Fingers interlaced. A
text: somber expression on his face.
speaker_heading: CHIEF NYBACK
dialog: And then you lost him.
text: Will sits opposite him. Wet, dishevelled, dirty. Hap's
text: blood smeared all over his shirt. Staring off into space.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: And then I lost him. In the fog.
speaker_heading: CHIEF NYBACK
dialog: About how long 'til you heard the
dialog: suspect's second shot?
text: Will, hesitates.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Twenty, thirty seconds. I followed the
dialog: sound down to the water. That's where...
text: He blinks. Looks down. Swallows.
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: That's where I found Hap.
text: Nyback sighs, shakes his head. Reaches down to his bottom
text: drawer and pulls out a bottle of bourbon and a glass.
speaker_heading: CHIEF NYBACK
dialog: I think you need a glass of this.
text: He goes to unscrew the bottle, but Will shakes his head.
text: Stands. Paces. Rakes his hand through his hair.
text: Turns suddenly and swipes his arm across Nyback's desk.
text: Everything CRASHES to the floor.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (yells)
dialog: Why didn't I know about that goddamn
dialog: tunnel, Charlie?
text: Nyback looks up at him. Calm.
speaker_heading: CHIEF NYBACK
dialog: There's a bunch of those tunnels out
text: there, Will. From bunkers over sixty
dialog: years old. I don't even know half of
dialog: them myself, and I grew up here.
text: Will clenches his fists.
speaker_heading: WILL
text: I had him, Charlie. Right in front of
text: me. Not two feet. I could smell the son-
dialog: of-a-bitch. Playing with me. And I
text: missed the shot. He was right there and
dialog: I missed the shot! Then my goddamned gun
dialog: jammed...
text: Nyback gets up. Limps over to his old friend.
speaker_heading: CHIEF NYBACK
dialog: Will, you can't blame yourself.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I had him!
speaker_heading: CHIEF NYBACK
dialog: It's only gonna make you crazy.
text: Just then there's a soft KNOCK on the door. The men look
text: over. Ellie sticks her head in. Speaks in a tone that
text: belies that a man has recently died.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: You wanted to see me?
text: Will turns his back to her. Nyback heads over.
speaker_heading: CHIEF NYBACK
dialog: Right, Ellie.
text: Ellie flicks a look at the pile on the floor. At Will's
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: CHIEF NYBACK (cont'd)
dialog: I want you to take care of the
dialog: investigation into Detective Eckhart's
dialog: shooting.
text: Ellie looks at him. Confused. Lowers her voice.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: But what about the Connell case? I'm on
dialog: the Connell case.
text: Nyback puts a hand on her shoulder.
speaker_heading: CHIEF NYBACK
dialog: We need paperwork, Ellie. You know that.
dialog: Just write up a quick report.
text: Ellie's shoulders droop. Thought she was playing with the
text: big boys. Just then Will turns abruptly and grabs his coat.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I'm going to check on the roadblocks...
text: Nyback catches his arm.
speaker_heading: CHIEF NYBACK
dialog: You're no good right now, Will. Go back
dialog: to the Lodge. Try to get some rest.
text: Will looks at him. Know's he's right.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD - NIGHTMUTE - DAY
text: CLOSE ON a SQUEALING tire, ripping around a curve...
scene_heading: INT./EXT. SILVER JEEP CHEROKEE - CONTINUOUS
text: Will driving. Speeding. Scenery whipping past the window.
text: His hands, tight around the steering wheel. The hula-girl,

text: her face.
text: He grows suddenly pale. Pulls the Cherokee off to the side.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS
text: Will jumps out of the Cherokee, leaving the door open. Runs
text: down an ALLEY behind a row of shops.
scene_heading: INT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS
text: A couple industrial trash bins. Will leans his hand against
text: the wall and vomits. Hovers for a moment, saliva dripping
text: from his mouth. Braces himself. Heaves again. Hears a
text: BUZZING behind him. Turns.
text: A DEAD DOG lying next to a dumpster. FLIES buzzing around
text: its head. Teeth bared. Eyes wide open.
text: Like it's watching him.
scene_heading: INT. PIONEER LODGE - LATER
text: Will walks up to reception. No one there. Just wants his
text: key. Rings the bell. In the back room, he hears a RADIO.
speaker_heading: RADIO
dialog: ...earlier this evening after an aborted
text: attempt to apprehend a suspect. He was
dialog: forty-five...
text: It clicks off abruptly. Rachel appears in the doorway.
text: Takes in the blood on Will's shirt.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I'm sorry about your partner.
text: Will looks at her. She walks over to the desk.
speaker_heading: RACHEL (cont'd)
dialog: It's been on the radio for the last two
dialog: hours. Nothing but that. Like when they
text: found Kay Connell's body.
dialog: (sympathetic smile)
dialog: We're not used to this sort of thing up
dialog: here.
text: She reaches for his key.
speaker_heading: RACHEL (cont'd)
text: He was standing right there just a couple
dialog: of days ago. Your partner. Exactly
dialog: where you are now.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I hope I was nice to him.
text: Will takes his key.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You were nice to him. He liked you.
text: He smiles faintly, turns to go. Just then the phone RINGS.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (answering)
dialog: Pioneer Lodge?...
dialog: (listens)
dialog: Hold on a second. He's right here.
text: Will stops. Turns. Rachel holds up the phone. Covering the
text: mouthpiece.
speaker_heading: RACHEL (cont'd)
dialog: John Warfield. He's called a couple of
dialog: times.
text: Will's stomach drops. That's the last phone call in the
text: world he wants to take. Rachel reads his face.
speaker_heading: RACHEL (cont'd)
dialog: Want me to lie?
text: Will shakes his head. Steps back and takes the phone.
text: Clears his throat.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Dormer.
text: PAUSE. A bemused VOICE on the other end.
speaker_heading: WARFIELD'S VOICE
dialog: Detective Dormer. I've been trying to
dialog: reach you. I was very sorry to hear
dialog: about your partner, Detective Eckhart.
dialog: It must have been a terrible shock, what
dialog: happened this morning.
text: Will. Not giving this asshole an inch. Rachel, trying not
dialog: to listen.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: That's not exactly how I'd put it.
speaker_heading: WARFIELD'S VOICE (cont'd)
dialog: No, no. I suppose not. But I look
dialog: forward to reading the report. Very
dialog: sad. Very sad. Funny...
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: What do you mean, "Funny?"
speaker_heading: WARFIELD'S VOICE
dialog: Oh, nothing. Just that I felt Detective
dialog: Eckhart and I, Hap and I, were starting
dialog: to make a real connection before you
dialog: left. I sensed that he was ready to get
dialog: some things off his chest. Did you
dialog: sense anything like that, Detective? I
dialog: mean, as his partner?...
text: Will, squeezing the phone cord with his bloody fist.
speaker_heading: WARFIELD'S VOICE (cont'd)
dialog: ...You were his partner for, what, about
dialog: ten years?...
text: Will turns from Rachel. Eyes burning. Voice steady.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: You know why everyone hates you,
dialog: Warfield? It's not your questions, it's
dialog: not your press conferences, it's not even
dialog: your cheap suits; everyone hates you
dialog: 'cause day after day you suck the marrow
dialog: out of real cops when you never had the
dialog: balls to become one yourself. Well I got
dialog: to tell you, it's a shame you're not up
dialog: here with me because I'd love to show you
dialog: right now just what a real cop is capable
dialog: of. You just remember that when you're
dialog: sitting at your bullshit desk reading
dialog: your bullshit report on my dead partner!
text: SLAM! He hangs up the phone. Runs his hand through his
text: hair. Turns back to Rachel.
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: Next time. Go ahead and lie.
scene_heading: EXT. ROCKY BEACH - OUTSIDE NIGHTMUTE - MORNING
text: Fog everywhere. Dense. White. Suffocating.
text: We're running through it. Clambering over rocks. Hearing
text: the sound of our own BREATHING. Our own HEARTBEAT.
text: Adrenaline pumping. An animal tracking its prey...
scene_heading: SUDDENLY a DARK FIGURE
text: flashes past. Just inches away. Playing with us. Taunting
text: us. We whip round with our weapon and...
scene_heading: INT. WILL'S ROOM - LATE NIGHT
text: BANG! Will bolts upright in bed. A film of sweat over his
text: body. Breathing hard. The sound that woke him: the window
text: shade FLAPPING open. LIGHT floods the room.
text: Will gets up. Goes over to the shade and pulls it down. It
text: lurches up halfway. He tugs it down again. It slaps all the
text: way open. Will yanks it down so hard it rips off the window.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Goddammit!
text: He gets tangled in it.
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: Goddamned...thing!
text: Pulls it off and flings it in the corner.
scene_heading: INT. WILL'S ROOM - 4:22 A.M.
text: The digital clock flips to a new minute: 4:23. Will,
text: pacing. Scratching at his stubble. Unable to sleep. Keeps
text: stepping on a SQUEAKY floorboard.
text: Slows near the ADJOINING DOOR that leads into Hap's room.
text: Hovers. Lightly pushes the door open. Sees...
text: THE PICTURES on the bedside table. A WOMAN and three teenage
dialog: GIRLS. Hap's family.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - 5:18 A.M.
text: Water gushing out of the faucet. Will's WATCH sitting on the
text: sink's edge. 5:18.
text: Will reaches up into the open medicine cabinet for a bottle
text: of aspirin. Shakes out a couple. Cups his hand under the
text: water and knocks the pills back.
text: Closes the medicine cabinet and CRIES out...
speaker_heading: HAP'S REFLECTION
text: looming behind him.
speaker_heading: HAP
dialog: They're watching us, Will...
text: Will whirls around...
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Hap!
dialog: ...nothing. No one's there.
scene_heading: EXT. MAINSTREET - NIGHTMUTE - MORNING
text: CLOSE ON running shoes, POUNDING the tarmac. PULL BACK to
text: reveal Will running down Nightmute's main street. Eyes
text: bloodshot.
text: A COUPLE NATIVE ALASKANS walking into a hardware store. Stop
text: talking and glance over at him.
text: A YOUNG MOTHER in her husband's work shirt. Lifts her small
text: KIDS into the cab of a 4x4. Watches him pass.
text: AN OLDER MAN fixing the broken "E" on his store front. Turns
text: at the sound of Will's footfall.
text: Everyone edgy. Cautious. A murderer amongst them.
text: Will continues on. Looking straight ahead. Wipes the sweat
text: from his neck. Slows to a stop just outside the...
scene_heading: LOCAL CONVENIENCE STORE
text: A blown-up picture of KAY CONNELL in the window. Below, a
dialog: painted sign: We miss you, Kay.
text: A stack of newspapers by the front door. The "Nightmute
text: Ledger." The headline: Seattle Cop Killed by Suspect.
text: Will picks one up. Stares down at it. Rain starts to dot
dialog: the paper.
speaker_heading: CHIEF NYBACK (O.S.)
dialog: ...We're going to bring down a couple of
dialog: guys from Ridgemount, but I want us to
dialog: step up the investigation here...
scene_heading: INT. BULLPEN - NIGHTMUTE PD - CONTINUOUS
text: Rain hammering against the windows. Chief Nyback addresses
text: the bullpen. Everyone's there except Farrell.
speaker_heading: CHIEF NYBACK
dialog: ...Nightmute hasn't lost an officer in
dialog: thirty-seven years, and even though
dialog: Detective Eckhart wasn't from here, he
dialog: was as good as one of us on this case. I
dialog: had the honor of working with him down in
dialog: Seattle for a number of years. He was a
dialog: fine detective and an even better man.
text: Will stands nearby, watching the rain hit the windows. His
text: suit pants are slightly wrinkled. Nyback nods towards Fred.
speaker_heading: CHIEF NYBACK (cont'd)
dialog: Fred, you'll be working with Detective
text: Dormer directly from now on.
text: Fred, stroking his moustache, nods. Nyback turns to Will.
speaker_heading: CHIEF NYBACK (cont'd)
dialog: Will? Anything you'd like to add?
text: Will looks up. Everyone's eyes turn to him. He shakes his
dialog: head.
speaker_heading: CHIEF NYBACK
dialog: Okay. Then let's get to it.
text: Feet shuffling. Chairs scraping the floor as people get up.
text: A sense of determination in the air. Will grabs his coat.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (O.S.)
dialog: Detective Dormer?
text: He turns. Ellie is beside him, holding a map.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (cont'd)
dialog: I'm sorry to bother you, but I was asked
dialog: to write the report on...
dialog: (lowers eyes)
dialog: ...you know what I was asked to write the
dialog: report on...
dialog: (looks back up)
dialog: ...Could you, just to be accurate, for
dialog: the report, could you just point out
dialog: where you were when you saw Detective
dialog: Eckhart yesterday?
text: She holds out the map. It's of the small stretch of
text: coastline. Red circles marking various points.
text: Will looks down at her. Takes the map. Turns it around.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: It's good to be accurate, Ellie. You're
dialog: doing your job.
text: He looks down at the map. Ellie watching his face.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: I'm so sorry about what happened. I know
dialog: you did everything you could...
text: Will points to a spot. Cutting her off.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I was here.
text: Hands her back the map. Smiles. Just then Fred walks up.
speaker_heading: FRED
text: Dormer. Still no sign of the bullet that
dialog: went through Farrell.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I'm going to the hospital to talk to him
dialog: now.
text: (looks at his watch)
dialog: You get the search party together. No
dialog: fewer than thirty people. I'll meet you
dialog: in exactly twenty-five minutes. Don't
dialog: waste any time.
text: He pulls on his coat and heads for the door. Fred watches
text: him leave. Sticks a toothpick in his mouth.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Partner or no partner. That guy's a
dialog: prick.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: He has to be a prick, Fred. He's a great
dialog: detective.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - ST. FRANCIS HOSPITAL - DAY
text: CLOSE ON the cover of one of the paperbacks, Otherwise
text: Engaged by Walter Byrd.
text: PULL BACK to reveal Farrell lying in a hospital bed in

text: he turns the page.
text: A SNICKERS BAR is tossed onto his lap. He looks up. Face
text: brightens.
speaker_heading: FARRELL
dialog: Detective Dormer!
text: Will stands by his bed. Farrell puts down the book. Picks
text: up the Snickers.
speaker_heading: FARRELL (cont'd)
dialog: You don't seem like the bring-an-
dialog: underling-who's-in-the-hospital-a-
dialog: Snickers-bar kind of guy.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I'm not.
text: He pulls up a chair. Nods to the paperback.
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: How's the book?
text: Farrell bites into the candy bar.
speaker_heading: FARRELL
dialog: Oh, a real tear-jerker. Brody, the good
dialog: guy, just got shot.
text: He stops chewing. Realises the association. Swallows
dialog: uncomfortably.
speaker_heading: FARRELL (cont'd)
dialog: Oh. I'm sorry. About Hap. Detective
dialog: Eckhart.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: FARRELL
dialog: I wish I'd had the chance to get to know
dialog: him better. Take him fishing or
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: He would have liked that.
speaker_heading: FARRELL
dialog: We just gotta catch the bastard, right?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: That's why I'm here. I need to know
dialog: exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell.
speaker_heading: FARRELL
dialog: What I saw?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Anything. It's important.
text: Farrell takes another bite of the Snickers. Like a little
text: boy. Furrows his brow, trying to remember.
speaker_heading: FARRELL
dialog: Pretty much nothing. That fog was so
text: thick. The bullet seemed to come out of
dialog: nowhere. I don't even remember seeing
dialog: any shapes. Then I saw you. But only
dialog: when you came up close. Then you
dialog: disappeared again.
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: I guess I heard more than I saw.
text: Will sighs, rubs his eyes.
speaker_heading: FARRELL (cont'd)
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: No. No. Don't be sorry. It's not your
dialog: fault.
text: Just then a NURSE comes in with a Dixie cup. Pretty,
text: freckled face. Not much older than Kay Connell.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Time for your meds.
text: Farrell smiles at her, winks at Will.
speaker_heading: FARRELL
dialog: Lonnie and I went to high school
dialog: together.
text: Lonnie gives him the cup.
speaker_heading: LONNIE
dialog: Just take the pills, Farrell.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: How's the leg?
speaker_heading: FARRELL
dialog: Oh, you know. Don't feel that much.
text: Bullet went right through.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Right. Got lost in the rocks.
speaker_heading: FARRELL
dialog: We'll get the other one, though.
text: Will looks up. Farrell pops the rest of the Snickers in his
dialog: mouth.
speaker_heading: FARRELL (cont'd)
text: After the autopsy.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - HOSPITAL - LATER
text: Will walks down the hallway. Light pouring in from a set of
text: high windows. He looks tired. Set-upon.
speaker_heading: POV of SOMEONE
text: WATCHING HIM. From a doorway. Not close, not far. A HAND
text: comes into view. Small. Bruised knuckles. Holds on to the
text: door jamb. Watches as...
text: Will suddenly stops. Skin prickling at the back of his neck.
text: Turns and looks around.
text: A MAN in a wheelchair.
dialog: 
text: A LITTLE GIRL tugging at her hospital gown.
text: A couple of NURSES laughing at check-in.
text: An empty doorway.
dialog: Nothing.
scene_heading: EXT. ROCKY BEACH - OUTSIDE NIGHTMUTE - MORNING
text: Back at the beach. We see nothing but fog. A VOICE comes
dialog: through.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (O.S.)
dialog: ...and it was at this point that Detective
text: Dormer headed towards the noise...
text: Ellie emerges from the fog. Carrying the map and talking
text: into a small tape recorder. She's climbing over the rocks,
text: wearing a windbreaker a couple sizes too big.
text: A UNIFORMED OFFICER follows, carrying a camera. She turns to
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (cont'd)
dialog: Remember, Kepp, shoot everything...
dialog: (back to the tape recorder)
dialog: ...wherein he discovered the wounded
dialog: Detective Farrell Brooks, having been
text: shot in the vastus externus of the upper
dialog: left thigh...
text: She climbs over the same bank Will Dormer climbed two
dialog: evenings before. Finds...
text: ANOTHER UNIFORMED OFFICER, hanging out and smoking.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (cont'd)
dialog: Francis!
text: He looks up. Pimples on his chin.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: You're supposed to be Farrell. Shot in
text: the thigh and writhing in pain.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: C'mon, Ellie. What's it matter?
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Accuracy. That's what.
dialog: (points to the ground)
dialog: Now get down.
text: Francis looks up at her. Flicks his cigarette away and gets
text: down amongst the rocks. Holds his thigh like he was shot.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Ow.
text: CLICK! Kepp takes the picture.
scene_heading: EXT. DOWN BY THE WATER - MINUTES LATER
text: Ellie sloshes through the water. Ankles getting cold.
text: Cheeks pink. But it doesn't matter. She's investigating.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: (into tape recorder)
dialog: ...shortly after hearing the second shot,
text: Detective Dormer continued through the
text: water until he spotted the body, lying
text: approximately fifteen feet away.
text: She stops. Looks at the map. At the spot Will pointed out.
text: Looks back up. Fog. Clicks off the recorder. Calls out.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (cont'd)
dialog: You there, Rich?
text: A VOICE calls back. Someone pretending to be Hap.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Yeah. And I'm freezing my nads off!
text: Ellie furrows her brow. Just then...
text: FRANCIS appears. Slips on a rock but catches his fall.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Ellie! Think I found something!
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD NEAR BEACH - DAY
text: CLOSE ON a row of FEET. Mostly boots. Some more beat-up
text: than others. Inching forward along a road.
speaker_heading: WILL (O.S.)
dialog: ...Anything catches your eye, you put it
dialog: in a bag. Anything looks strange, you
dialog: put it in a bag...
text: PULL BACK to reveal a long line of PEOPLE stretched out
text: across the road about a mile up the beach. Some old, some
text: young. Linking arms and moving forward. Looking down. The
scene_heading: SEARCH PARTY.
text: Will, walking up and down behind the line. Talking through a
text: megaphone.
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: ...Anything he may have dropped, moved,
dialog: kicked, or stepped on, you put in a bag.
text: Cigarette butts, gum wrappers, paper
dialog: clips, coins, buttons - nine times out of
text: ten a suspect leaves something behind...
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Detective?
text: Will turns. A couple burly GUYS with some BLOODHOUNDS.
speaker_heading: BURLY GUY #1
dialog: Where do you want us?
text: Will points over to the woods on the other side of the road.
speaker_heading: WILL
text: The woods. One group heading south, the
text: other heading north.
text: Nods to Fred who's standing nearby. He hands the guys two
dialog: radios.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Make sure they're set to channel 6...
text: Just then two young OFFICERS pull up in a squad car. Young
text: and apple-cheeked. The first one holding a piece of paper.
speaker_heading: OFFICER #1
dialog: We did the interviews with all the nearby
dialog: houses like you asked.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Anything?
speaker_heading: OFFICER #1
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: Here's a list of who we talked to.
text: Hands the list to Will. He glances it.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Alright. Go back and set up some follow-
dialog: ups for this afternoon.
text: The Officers nod, put the car in reverse. Fred saunters
text: over. Nods towards the searchers.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: You don't think they should start further
dialog: back?
text: Will shakes his head.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: He had to have exited here. Over those
text: boulders. I saw him move, he's nimble.
dialog: Would have taken the hardest way out.
text: Fred shrugs, skeptical. Just then, his cell phone BLEATS.
text: He reaches for it.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Duggar...
text: Will looks back at the search team. Slow. Meticulous.
speaker_heading: FRED (cont'd)
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Where was it?
text: A local WOMAN. At the end of the line. Glances over her
text: shoulder. Looks at Will. Smiles. You'll help us catch him.
speaker_heading: FRED (cont'd)
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Okay.
dialog: (slaps phone closed)
dialog: That was Ellie.
text: Will turns back to him.
speaker_heading: FRED (cont'd)
dialog: They found Farrell's bullet. Says it
text: looks like a 357. After the autopsy Rich
dialog: can drive 'em both to the lab in
dialog: Anchorage. Have a murder weapon by
dialog: morning.
text: Fred crosses his arms. Sarcastic.
speaker_heading: FRED (cont'd)

text: umbrella stand. Hands him an umbrella.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Here. It's on the house.
text: Will takes it. Preoccupied.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Thanks.
text: He starts up the stairs. Notices Rachel straining to return
text: the key to the top of the clock. Backtracks to help her.
text: She gets it without his help.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I got it.
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Don't know why I bother. It's been
dialog: broken for two years.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Habit.
text: Rachel looks at him. Can't figure this guy out. Remembers
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: RACHEL (cont'd)
dialog: Oh. A man came by to see you earlier.
dialog: Said he was your new partner.
text: A TINGLE skips down Will's spine. He looks at her.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Fred Duggar?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: No. He didn't say what his name was.
dialog: Only that you were expecting him.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I'm not expecting anyone.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: That's not what he thinks.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: What did he look like?
text: Rachel thinks for a second. Leaning against the clock.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Short. Dark hair. Not that memorable.
text: Will nods, rubs his forehead. Suddenly has a pounding
text: headache. Turns for the stairs. Hesitates.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I need to borrow something.
scene_heading: INT. WILL'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: CLOSE ON a nail. One THWACK of a hammer and it bites into
text: the wall. PULL BACK to reveal Will nailing the corner of a
text: blanket to one side of the window. An ad hoc curtain.
text: He finishes that side. Starts to stretch the blanket across
text: the window. Hesitates. Looks outside. To the left. To the
dialog: right. To see if anybody's out there. If anybody's
dialog: watching. Sees instead...
text: A LONE TUGBOAT chugging across the harbor. Pulling a huge
text: freighter. Will squeezes his eyes shut. Opens them again.
text: Pulls the blanket fully across the window.
scene_heading: INT. WILL'S ROOM - 1:05 A.M.
text: The FILES spread across the floor. Their edges buckled from
text: the rain. Dozens of pictures of Kay Connell. School
dialog: records. Private letters. Health files. Coroner's report.
text: Will. Pacing. Back and forth. Thinking. Over that same
text: SQUEAKY floorboard. The clock reads: 1:05.
scene_heading: INT. WILL'S ROOM - 2:20 A.M.
text: Will lying in bed. On top of the blanket. Wide awake.
text: Staring at the ADJOINING DOOR. Into Hap's room.
scene_heading: EXT. PIONEER LODGE - NIGHTMUTE - LATE NIGHT
text: Will, in a sweatshirt and coat, heads down the front steps of

scene_heading: EXT. MAINSTREET - NIGHTMUTE - LATE NIGHT
text: Will walking down main street. In the middle of the road.
text: The dead of night. No cars. The sky a blinding white.
text: Hears some rowdy NOISE coming from a corner bar, beer lights
text: flickering. A WOMAN rides by on a bicycle. Birds SINGING.
dialog: 
text: Not day. Not night. Stuck somewhere in between. Like a
dialog: dream.
text: Turns down a side street. Passing more stores. Guns and
text: Ammo. Patty's Hair and Nails. General Store. Comes upon
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE ALLEY
text: where he vomited the day before. Stops. Sees the DEAD DOG,
text: still down at the end. Half obscured by the dumpster.
text: Will wavers, pale. Suddenly...
text: A HOMELESS MAN emerges from the shadows. Big. Wild-eyed.
text: Awakened from his sleep. Will, quickly backtracks to the
text: sidewalk. Spooked.
text: JUST THEN the CRACK! of bat hitting ball. He turns. In the
text: distance. Nightmute Elementary School.
scene_heading: EXT. NIGHTMUTE ELEMENTARY - LATE NIGHT
text: A Little League game in full swing. The uniforms, a little
text: faded. The diamond, a little unkempt. A smattering of
text: SPECTATORS. Mostly dads with six-packs.
text: Will wanders over to the fence. Spots Ellie sitting alone on
text: the bottom bleacher.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: POV OF SOMEONE
text: WATCHING HIM. From afar. The SOUNDS of the game, delayed a

speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
text: ...and sits down next to Ellie. She turns, surprised.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (cont'd)
dialog: Detective Dormer! What are you doing
dialog: here?
dialog: (looks at watch)
text: It's two-thirty in the morning.
dialog: Shouldn't you be asleep?
text: Will glances out at the game.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I could say the same thing about you.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Oh. We always have play-offs in the
dialog: middle of the night. It's the best time.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Who's playing?
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: The Puffins and the Hawks. We're in
dialog: extra innings. The Hawks have a really
dialog: good line-up this year.
text: She sips on a take-out coke. Looks back at the game. A
text: plump, redheaded GIRL comes up to bat. Blows a bubble.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: That's my sister.
text: Will looks over just in time to see the girl swing and miss
text: by a mile. Ellie cups her hands around her mouth.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (cont'd)
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: That's okay, Lib!
dialog: (to Will)
dialog: Usually she's better.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: She your only sibling?
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: (nods)
text: Twelve years younger.
text: Libby takes another swing. Connects with the ball. Drops
text: the bat and runs to first. Ellie gives a sharp WHISTLE.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (cont'd)
dialog: What about you? You have any siblings?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: No.
dialog: (rubs his eyes)
dialog: Well. I had a brother. He died when I
dialog: was eleven.
text: Ellie, sits up...
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Oh, I shouldn't have...
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: It's okay. Happened a long time ago. He
text: was killed in a fire. In New Mexico.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: That must have been awful for you.
text: Will leans back. Stretching his legs. Remembering.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Not really.
dialog: (slight smile)
dialog: I remember I was more embarrassed that he
dialog: had died. Embarrassed that it made me
dialog: different. So I didn't tell the other kids
dialog: at school what had happened. They'd ask

dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: Nice kid, huh? Just kept making up more
dialog: and more lies...
text: Suddenly, he stops talking. Slowly sits up. Sensing
text: something. Ellie, noticing the shift.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: You okay?
text: The row of DADS behind them. Jump up and start CHEERING.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: POV OF THE PERSON
text: WATCHING WILL. Sees him sit up. Look around. That same

speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
text: ...Will stands. Trying to shake the feeling.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I'm going back to the Lodge, Ellie.
dialog: Still need to go through some of Kay

speaker_heading: ELLIE

dialog: be back in about twenty minutes...
text: Stops at an open doorway in time to see
dialog: 
text: THE CORONER pull a sheet over the cold, blue body of Hap
dialog: Eckhart.
text: Will's heart lurches. He grabs on to the door jamb. Wasn't
text: ready for that. The coroner looks up.
speaker_heading: CORONER
dialog: Detective. Thought you were sending one
dialog: of your lackeys.
text: Will clears his throat. Closes his cell phone.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I thought it was better if I came. Under
dialog: the circumstances.
text: The coroner nods. Goes to wash her hands.
speaker_heading: CORONER
dialog: It's different when you know them, isn't
dialog: it?
dialog: (nods to clipboard)
dialog: Just sign over there and she's all yours.
text: Shrugs off her lab coat. She's wearing a blue dress. Looks
text: like a piano teacher. Heads into an adjoining office.
text: Will. Alone. Steps into the room. The smell of
text: formaldehyde. Bloody instruments on a stainless steel tray.
text: Walks towards the clipboard, eyes flicking over to the shape
dialog: under the sheet when...
text: SUDDENLY Hap's HAND drops down. Thick fingers. Wedding
dialog: band.
text: Will jumps...
speaker_heading: CORONER (O.S.)
dialog: Your partner didn't suffer much...
text: The coroner re-emerges from the office with a manila
text: envelope. Hap Eckhart written on it in black pen.
speaker_heading: CORONER (cont'd)
dialog: Maybe for a minute or two.
text: Will rubs his face. Tries to focus on the clipboard. The
text: coroner holds out the envelope. Smiles.
speaker_heading: CORONER (cont'd)
dialog: Just enough time to reflect.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Thanks, Doc.
text: He takes the envelope. The coroner peers up at him.
speaker_heading: CORONER

scene_heading: INT. BULLPEN - NIGHTMUTE PD - DAY

scene_heading: INT. STORAGE ROOM - NIGHTMUTE PD - DAY
text: CLOSE on a key slipping into a padlock. Opens with a CLICK!
text: PULL BACK to reveal Fred and Will in a small storage room.
text: Standing in front of an army-green LOCKER. The evidence

text: ANTLERS hanging over a small window. Will glances up.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: What's with all the moose antlers around
dialog: here?
text: Fred throws a look over his shoulder. Opens the locker.
speaker_heading: FRED
text: Lots of moose.
text: INSIDE THE LOCKER - another manila envelope. The name on
dialog: this one: Farrell Brooks.
text: Fred reaches back for the other envelope. Will, hesitant to
text: give it to him. Feeling the bump of the bullet in the bottom
text: corner. Hands it over. Wipes his brow.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: When's Rich coming?
text: Fred slides it in beside Farrell's. Closes the locker door.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: I'll call him now.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: First I need a copy of the key.
text: Fred turns, a twinkle in his eye.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: This isn't Seattle, Detective. We don't
dialog: have copies.
dialog: (holds up key)
dialog: This is the only one.
text: Will looks at him. At the key. Plucks it from his hand.
text: Just then Nyback's SECRETARY appears in the doorway.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: Detective Dormer? Telephone.
scene_heading: INT. BULLPEN - NIGHTMUTE PD - DAY
text: The secretary hands Will the phone. Pulls something from
text: under the desk. A beat-up BOX. Will's name on it.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: This came for you earlier.
text: Will glances at it. Takes the phone. Rubs his eyes.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Dormer.
text: Nothing. Someone's there but they're not saying anything.
dialog: Will, too tired for this shit...
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: Goddammit, Warfield, if you're gonna
dialog: check up on me every...
text: Then...the VOICE. A MAN's voice. Not John Warfield's.
text: This voice is medium-ranged. Higher. Nose sounds stuffed.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: I bet you haven't been getting much
dialog: sleep.
text: Will straightens. Something weird.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: What?
text: A little TITTER on the other end.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: You lower-48s. You think the white
dialog: nights are kind of neat. Then you can't
dialog: sleep for days. I've seen it happen
dialog: about a million times. But you can't
dialog: sleep for a different reason.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Who is this?
text: A PAUSE. Will loosens his tie.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: I said, who is this?
text: The voice. Dropping to a WHISPER.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: I saw what really happened, Will...
text: Will, furrows his brow.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: I saw you kill your partner. With your
text: back-up weapon. Out there on the beach.
dialog: I saw you shoot him dead...
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON
text: Will Dormer's face.
text: As all the blood drains from it.
speaker_heading: As all SOUND
text: fades around him.
dialog: As his heart
dialog: 
text: begins to POUND against his chest.
text: He falters, reaching out for the desk. To steady himself.
text: As if the floor's just dropped out beneath him. Eyes,
text: darting around the bullpen...
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (sotto, into phone)
dialog: Now you listen to me...
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: Don't worry. I won't tell anyone. Oh,
dialog: and I saw you take my gun. My uncle's
dialog: old 357. I dropped it in the rocks.
dialog: But you can go ahead and keep that.
text: CHIEF NYBACK, exits his office. Looks at Will and smiles.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
dialog: ...I mean...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: ...Now that we're partners.
text: CLICK. The line goes dead.
text: Will, throat constricted. Listening to the DIAL TONE.
text: Smiles back at Nyback. Turns. Slowly hangs up the phone.
text: White as a sheet. Trying to act normal. Trying to act calm.
text: SOUND returning to the bullpen, like nothing's different.
text: Looks over at
speaker_heading: THE BOX
text: sitting on the edge of the secretary's desk. He reaches for
text: it. Carefully, rips the packing tape. Bends back a flap.
text: Inside, some dark blue material. An embroidered daisy.
dialog: 
text: Kay Connell's knapsack.
scene_heading: EXT. NIGHTMUTE POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY
text: Will, heading for the Cherokee. Clutching the box. Face
text: pale, pace quick. Everything's different now.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (O.S.)
dialog: Detective Dormer!
text: He closes his eyes. Now is not the time. Reaches the
text: Cherokee. Yanks open the driver's side door. Ellie catches
text: up with him. Out of breath.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: You look like you're in a hurry. I just
dialog: wanted to ask you about these pictures.
text: She smiles, holds up some PHOTOGRAPHS. They're of the BEACH.
text: The ones Kepp took. Almost all fog.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (cont'd)
dialog: I know they're not great quality, but
dialog: this is where you said you were when you
dialog: first saw Detective Eckhart, right?
text: Will. Barely glancing at them. Tosses the box into the car.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Right.
text: Gets in and closes the door. Puts his hand over the box.
text: Ellie comes up to the window.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: But here's the thing. I retraced your
dialog: exact steps according to your statement.
dialog: You couldn't have seen Detective Eckhart
dialog: from there. I mean, not in that fog.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Then change it.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: How much closer would you say you were?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I don't remember.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Five feet? Seven feet?
text: Will, about to seriously lose his shit. Looks at Ellie.
text: Eyes dark, distant.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Listen, Ellie. I don't have time for
dialog: this shit. Five feet, seven feet, twenty
dialog: feet. Put down whatever you want in your
dialog: report, alright?
text: He turns the ignition. Pulls out with a SQUEAL. Ellie
text: steps back, watching him drive away. More curious than
dialog: stung.
scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE NIGHTMUTE - DAY
text: The Cherokee. Parked off-road. A remote spot by the water.
text: The driver's side door, left open. The PING-PING-PING of the
text: interior BELL.
scene_heading: EXT. BREAKFRONT - DAY
text: Will Dormer, walking along a breakfront. Aimless. One foot
text: in front of the other. Staring out at nothing. The endless
text: sea. Waves CRASHING. Wind HOWLING. Seagulls SCREECHING.
text: Everything. Closing in on him...
text: He stumbles over a rock. Grabs his head in his hands.
text: Stunned. Guilty. Ashamed. Fucked.
dialog: He saw it. He saw it!
text: A WAVE, explodes nearby. Drenching him in sea spray.
text: Will turns, raking his hand across his face. Blinking. Eyes
text: stinging. Trying to focus. Trying to think this through...
text: Hears a dog BARKING in the distance.
text: Shakes his head. Looks at his watch.
dialog: Got to deal with the problem at hand.
scene_heading: INT. WILL'S ROOM - PIONEER LODGE - DAY
text: Will, bursts into his room at the Lodge. The shoulders of
text: his coat still wet with sea spray. Crosses to the area of
text: the floor where Kay Connell's files are still spread out.
text: Starts pressing the floorboards with the toe of his boot.
text: Testing. Testing. Until...he finds the one that SQUEAKS.
text: Gets down on his knees. Hesitates. Then jams his fingers in
text: around the loose board. Starts pulling it up. Face
text: reddening. Knuckles whitening. Slips his hand into the gap.
text: Pulls out a muddy 357 RUGER.
text: The killer's gun.
text: Will, stares down at it.
scene_heading: INT. ALLEY - DAY
text: Will, standing at the mouth of the ALLEY. Just like the
text: night before. Steps inside. Cautious. Eyes darting.
text: Peering into the shadows for the HOMELESS MAN...
text: Not there. Coast's clear. Heads for the dumpster at the end
text: of the alley. Shoves it aside. Looks down at...
text: The DEAD DOG. Rancid. Rotting. Will gags. Holds a
text: handkerchief to his face. Waving away the flies.
text: Then. Pulls the 357 Ruger from his pocket. Shrugs his coat
text: off and wraps it around his hand and the gun. Looks away.
text: Fires a muffled SHOT into the dog's side. The body kicks.
text: Crouches down. Feels along the dog's ribs for the bullet's
text: point of entry. Finds it. Pulls out a PENKNIFE and extends
text: one of the blades. Cuts into the gash, fingers probing deep
text: for the lodged bullet. He finds it. Pulls it out.
text: Looks back at the dog. Takes a deep breath. Wipes his brow.
text: A little smear of the dog's blood left on his forehead.
text: Turns and pulls a bottle of RUBBING ALCOHOL from his pocket.
text: Douses the bullet. Cleaning it. Glancing at his watch.
dialog: Running out of time...
scene_heading: EXT. NIGHTMUTE POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY
text: The rear of the Nightmute PD building. Will, looking around,
text: heads briskly for the back door...
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHTMUTE PD - DAY
text: ...steps into the HALLWAY leading towards the bullpen. Hears
text: VOICES. Nearby. Ducks back. Waiting for them to fade.
text: Safe. Heads down towards the STORAGE ROOM. Glancing briefly
text: at the PICTURES hanging on the wall. Of old time POLICE
text: OFFICERS. Striking brave poses...
scene_heading: INT. STORAGE ROOM - NIGHTMUTE PD - DAY
text: The storage room. Hot. Stifling. The moose antlers LOOMING
text: over his shoulder. Will pulls the evidence locker key from
text: his pocket. Unlocks the padlock. Swings the door open.
text: Pulls the Hap Eckhart envelope out. Throwing a look over his
text: shoulder. Opens it. Shakes out the bullet that was lodged
text: in Hap's spine. Then fishes a plastic bag from his pocket.
text: The bullet he shot into the dead dog. Drops that into the
text: envelope and reseals it. Hands shaking.
text: Something. Catches the corner of his eye. He turns.
text: HIS REFLECTION in the locker mirror. The blood smear still
text: on his forehead.
speaker_heading: FRED (O.S.)
dialog: Dormer...
text: Will jumps. Quickly wipes the smear off and turns. Fred
text: Duggar standing behind him. RICH by his side. Will clears
text: his throat, shoves Hap's envelope into Fred's hand. Then
text: Farrell's. Angry.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: These should have gone out two hours ago.
text: SLAMS the locker door and brushes past him. Fred and Rich

scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHTMUTE - DAY

speaker_heading: YOUNG GIRL (cont'd)
text: ...playing her flute, meeting at Darrow's
dialog: after school...
text: Will. Eyes bloodshot. Not really listening. Not really

speaker_heading: YOUNG GIRL
dialog: ...And always, always with a smile on her
dialog: face.
text: The young girl looks up. Folds the paper closed. People
text: SNIFFLE. Mrs. Connell, reaches out to squeeze her arm.
text: Some CHILDREN. Start circulating with plastic buckets.
text: Filled with white carnations. Handing them out.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Want one?

text: THE MOURNERS lining up to place the carnations on Kay's
text: casket.
text: AN OLD MAN with a brass-tipped cane. Two GIRLS, look like

speaker_heading: WILL

speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Thought I smelled something.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Good to see you, too, Randy.
text: Will arrives at the bike. The girl, TANYA FRANCKE, looks at

speaker_heading: TANYA
dialog: Who're you?
scene_heading: EXT. GRAVESITE - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: TANYA
dialog: I was her best friend.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Best friend?
speaker_heading: TANYA
dialog: Since grade school.
speaker_heading: WILL

speaker_heading: TANYA
dialog: Everybody says I'm holding up great,

speaker_heading: TANYA (cont'd)
dialog: But there's no law against not crying,

speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: What about Kay's other friends?
text: Tanya makes a face. Reaches out and taps the hula-girl.
speaker_heading: TANYA
dialog: Do we have to talk about Kay? I don't

speaker_heading: TANYA

scene_heading: INT./EXT. CHEROKEE - ROAD - DAY
text: Will drives, sipping take-out coffee. Trying to fight the
text: stinging in his eyes. Passes a sign: Umkumiut, 30 miles.
scene_heading: EXT. TESORO ALASKA GAS STATION - UMKUMIUT - DAY
text: Will stands in a phone booth at the gas station. Flips
text: through the phone book. His finger tracing down the "B"s.
text: Finds it: Walter Byrd, 451 S. Diamond Tooth, Apt. B.
scene_heading: EXT. DIAMOND TOOTH ROAD - UMKUMIUT - DAY
text: Sky's become overcast. Will stands across the street from a
text: pale blue building. On the ground floor, a tackle store.
text: Above, looks like several apartment units.
text: He starts across.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - APARTMENTS - DAY
text: Will heads down a narrow hallway. Tiled floor. Passes door
text: "A." Stops at the next one, "B." Knocks. Hears nothing but
text: the muted tv from apartment "A." Pulls out his gloves.
scene_heading: INT. WALTER BYRD'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: With a CLICK the door swings open. Will, gloves on, pockets
text: his credit card. Hears the CHING CHING of dog collars as
dialog: 
text: TWO LABRADOR RETRIEVERS stand at attention, GROWLING. Will's
text: prepared. Takes a bag of treats from his pocket.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Lucy. Desi.
text: The dogs break. Trot over to him. Wolf down the treats.
text: Will scans the place. Small, cheap. Matching sofa and easy
text: chair, corduroy upholstery. The walls, lined with old 1950s
dialog: movie posters. All second-rate detective movies: "Another
text: Shot in the Dark," "Lady Luck," "He wore a Black Hat."
text: Will walks across the room. Repulsed. The pathetic hovel of
text: a killer. Looks into the
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEDROOM
text: Single bed. Books and magazines. A half-eaten tuna sandwich
text: on the bedside table. "NYPD BLUE" calendar on the wall.
text: It's quiet. He walks over to a large DESK by the window.
text: Scattered papers. Computer. Mini cassette recorder.
dialog: 
text: On the wall, hundreds of newspaper articles. Some yellowing,
dialog: some fresh. All about cops: "Officer Louis Saved My Life!"
dialog: "Shoot-out in Soho," "South Street Cop Takes Down Drug
dialog: Ring," "Seattle Cop Killed by Suspect..."
text: Will curls his lip. Starts looking through the papers on the
text: desk. Underneath a stack, he finds an 8x10 PHOTOGRAPH. It's
text: of Byrd, standing in front of a big, lakeside HOUSE. A RADIO
text: TOWER in the background. Walter Byrd's face is blurred,
text: turned to the side. The photo from the book bio.
text: Will takes it. Starts roughly opening drawers. A box of
text: animal crackers, a rubber band ball. Then, shoved in the
text: back of the top drawer, an APPOINTMENT BOOK. Will flips
text: through to today's date. Blank. Shoves the book into his
text: pocket. Slams the door closed.
dialog: 
text: Then reaches back for his Smith 39/13. Checks the magazine.
text: Slaps it back in place. He's ready.
text: SUDDENLY the phone RINGS. A beige rotary on the desk.
text: Plugged into an ancient answering machine. It RINGS again.
text: The answering machine WHIRS. Then BEEPS.
speaker_heading: WALTER'S VOICE
dialog: Now you're mad at me.
text: Will freezes.
speaker_heading: WALTER'S VOICE (cont'd)
dialog: ...I spotted your car around the corner.
dialog: You must have been in a hurry. Put some
dialog: pieces together. Don't worry, I would
dialog: have done the same thing...
text: Will turns back to the window. Looking furiously...
speaker_heading: WALTER'S VOICE (cont'd)
dialog: Anyway...
dialog: (blows nose)
dialog: ...I'm not coming home. So you
dialog: shouldn't wait there all day. I mean,
dialog: they'll wonder about you at the station.
dialog: You should be careful about following
dialog: procedure, Will, especially now that...
text: Will lunges for the phone. Snatches it up just as CLICK! the
text: tape cuts off.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Goddammit!
text: Enraged, he PUNCHES the receiver through the wall.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - APARTMENTS - DAY
text: Will exits the apartment. Cradling his hand. Looks down at
text: the tile floor. Scanning it for a broken tile. Finds one.
text: Bends down and plucks out a broken corner.
text: Places it carefully where the bottom of the door meets the
text: door jamb. Just then. His BEEPER goes off.
scene_heading: INT. BULLPEN - NIGHTMUTE PD - DAY
text: Will strides into the bullpen. Wounded hand in pocket.
text: Ellie hunts and pecks at a typewriter. Glances up.
text: Fred, over in the corner. SLAMS a drawer in the filing
text: cabinet. Turns.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Forget your pager?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: I beeped you over two hours ago.
text: Holds out a one-page report.
speaker_heading: FRED (cont'd)
dialog: Got a fax from the lab. Murder weapon
dialog: was a 357 Ruger.
text: Will takes the report. Heads over to the coffee machine.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: And something else that might interest
dialog: you.
text: He reaches into his desk drawer and pulls out a book. Holds
text: it up. Otherwise Engaged. In hardback.
speaker_heading: FRED (cont'd)
dialog: Remember this?
text: Will blinks.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: One of the paperbacks we found in Kay
text: Connell's knapsack.
text: Will pours himself a cup of coffee. Trying to keep the
text: stream steady. Ellie continues typing...CLACK...CLACK...
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Mrs. Connell found this copy in the
dialog: house.
dialog: (opens it up)
dialog: It's signed. Personally.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: This is a local writer. Kay had all his
dialog: books. I think we should check it out.
text: CLACK...CLACK...CLACK...Will rubs his chin. Looks back at
dialog: the report. Judicious.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I don't think it'll lead anywhere.
text: The CLACKING stops. SILENCE. Will turns around. Ellie's
text: staring right at him - that isn't like him.
text: He turns back to Fred. Beat.
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: Well. If he's local. Give him a call.
text: The CLACKING resumes.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWAY - DIAMOND TOOTH ROAD - UMKUMIUT - LATE NIGHT
text: A dark stairway. Late at night. Will, bathed in shadows.
text: Climbs to the top. Quietly, carefully. He heads down a
text: hallway. We recognise it. Back where Walter Byrd lives.
dialog: 
text: Will approaches apartment "B." Slowly pulls out his weapon.
text: Cocks it. Waits a beat then swings out in front of the door.
text: Ready to fight. Ready to confront. Looks down...
text: Tile corner's still there.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. CHEROKEE - UMKUMIUT - NEXT DAY
text: CLOSE ON Walter Byrd's APPOINTMENT BOOK laying open.
text: Scrawled in pencil: 8:30. Dr. Agee.
text: PULL BACK to reveal Will sitting in the parked Cherokee. The
text: appointment book on the passenger seat. Been there all night.
text: Insomnia. Taking its toll. His hair, no longer neatly
text: combed. His face, pale and unshaven. His eyes, dragged open
text: from fatigue. Looks like the whole world's pulling him down.
text: Staring down the street at a
dialog: 
text: BRICK BUILDING on the corner. A placard by the front door:
dialog: Dr. Florence Agee, D.D.S.
text: Will checks his watch. Rubs his eyes with the heels of his
text: hands. Suddenly. Something tells him to look up.
speaker_heading: A MAN
text: in the distance, walking along the road. Towards Dr. Agee's.
text: He's in his forties. Short, shoulders sloped. Wears a
text: beige, zip-up windbreaker, khakis, brown desert boots.
speaker_heading: WALTER BYRD
text: has a bulky hearing aid in one ear. Is looking down at the
text: road. Glances up.
text: LOCKS EYES WITH WILL
text: Byrd, slows his pace.
text: Will, reaches for the door handle.
speaker_heading: SUDDENLY
text: Byrd turns in the other direction, starts walking fast.
text: Will leaps out of the Cherokee and heads after him.
speaker_heading: WALTER BYRD
text: his short legs pumping, spots a TOUR BUS across the road.
text: Veers over to it.
speaker_heading: WILL
text: a runner's stride. Weaves through PEOPLE. Closing in on
text: Byrd. Sees his plan. Cuts across the road just as...
speaker_heading: A PICK-UP
text: rounds the corner. THUMP! Broadsides him. Will's pitched
text: up and over the hood. Falls hard on the tarmac. Dazed for a
text: second. Blood, gushing from his forehead. Hears the PICK-UP
text: DOOR open...FEET running over to him.
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Are you alright? You popped out from
dialog: nowhere!
text: More FEET running over.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: He okay?
text: Will opens his eyes. Trying to focus. Looks up and sees, in
text: the distance...WALTER BYRD getting on the tour bus.
text: Will struggles to his feet. The OLD LADY who hit him,
text: wearing overalls. Reaches out.
speaker_heading: OLD LADY
dialog: I don't think you should move.
text: Will stands, wavering. Flashes her his badge.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. PICK-UP
text: The old lady rips along in the truck. Will sits in the
text: passenger seat, a handkerchief to his forehead. It's soaked
text: with blood. The lady looks over.
speaker_heading: OLD LADY
dialog: You sure you're okay?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I'm fine.
speaker_heading: OLD LADY
dialog: Careful not to bleed on my interior.
text: Will looks over at her. Shifts in his seat. Ouch. Feels
text: like a couple cracked ribs. Peers out the windshield at the
text: TOUR BUS a few cars ahead of them.
scene_heading: EXT. WINDY ROAD - CONTINUOUS
text: AERIAL VIEW of the pick-up tailing the tour bus. A windy
text: coastal road. Beyond it, a blanket of endless evergreens.
scene_heading: EXT. FERRY STATION - OUTSIDE UMKUMIUT - DAY
text: A FERRY at the end of the pier. A small wooden booth for
text: selling tickets. Beautiful, sweeping snow-capped mountains
text: on the other side of the bay. Nothing else for miles around.
text: The pick-up pulls up next to the bus and a couple other cars.
text: Will jumps out. Scans the area for Byrd. Nothing. Then,
text: sees the last few PEOPLE boarding the ferry.
scene_heading: INT. FERRY - MINUTES LATER
text: Ferry's getting pitched around in the roiling water. Most
text: everyone is inside. TOURISTS with throw-away cameras,
text: backpacks, anoraks, CHILDREN. Some looking sea-sick in the
dialog: corner.
text: Will weaves through the crowd. Eyes darting, searching. The
text: ferry lurches to one side, the crowd sways, Will spots
text: WALTER BYRD standing by a window.
scene_heading: INT. WINDOW - FERRY
text: Walter holds on to the railing. Looking at the view, the sea
text: spray. Will comes up. Stands next to him. Cognizant of the
text: people around them.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Walter Byrd.
text: Walter continues looking out the window. That same stuffed-
text: nose voice.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: When I was seven my mother and
dialog: grandmother took me to Vancouver. We
dialog: were walking along the street one day
dialog: when these two men ran past and snatched
dialog: my grandmother's purse right from under
text: her arm. Right from under her arm. That
dialog: night a police officer came to our hotel
dialog: room to ask us questions. Stood the
dialog: whole time.
text: The ferry pitches again. Will grabs on to the railing.
text: Looking down at this little man. Hate in his eyes.
speaker_heading: WALTER (cont'd)
text: His uniform looked brand new. His shoes
text: and badge were polished, his billy club,
text: his belt buckle. All perfect. He was
text: like a soldier, but better.
text: Walter reaches up to blow his nose. Will's eyes look on in
text: disgust - his knuckles are still red and swollen. From
text: beating Kay Connell to death.
speaker_heading: WALTER (cont'd)
dialog: Made a huge impression on me. His
dialog: goodness. Gave me an instant respect for
dialog: the police. I tried to become a cop when
dialog: I left high school, but...
text: He points to his hearing-aid.
speaker_heading: WALTER (cont'd)
dialog: Congenital problem.
text: The ferry's engine HUMS to a stop. Walter smiles.
speaker_heading: WALTER (cont'd)
dialog: Oh. We're here.
scene_heading: EXT. GENDREAU GLACIER - DAY
text: Gendreau Glacier. Spilling down between two huge mountains.
text: Enormous in its whiteness, its coldness, its silent power.
text: Will and Walter walk up its face, away from the other
text: tourists. Walter leads the way. Hands in his pockets.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: You know this glacier moves a quarter of
dialog: an inch every day?
text: He points off to the horizon.
speaker_heading: WALTER (cont'd)
dialog: And on a clear day you can see all the
dialog: way over to Newtok. There's a beautiful
dialog: aviary over there. We can go sometime.
text: Will's lip curls. Watching him.
speaker_heading: WALTER (cont'd)
dialog: It's actually cool for this time of year.
dialog: Normally the temperature runs about...
text: SUDDENLY Will lunges at him. Walter's eyes widen in surprise
text: as he grabs him up by the collar. Nose to nose. Will barely
dialog: keeping control.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You think this is a nice meeting we're
dialog: having here? Friendly? Two people
dialog: getting acquainted?
dialog: (jerks him harder)
dialog: You sick, coward, fuck. I get up every
dialog: morning of my life just to bring someone
dialog: like you down. Beating a seventeen year-
text: old girl to death. Washing her
dialog: afterwards, cleaning her. Make you feel
dialog: like a real man?
dialog: (tightens his grip)
dialog: Huh?
text: Walter flounders.
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: I outta end this right now. Take a rock
dialog: and smash your fucking skull in...
text: His jaws tense, nostrils flare. Walter, red-faced,
text: sputtering...
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I stood right behind you...I saw you look
text: right into his eyes and shoot him...
text: Will clenches his teeth.
speaker_heading: WALTER (cont'd)
dialog: ...Seattle's great hero. Shooting his
dialog: own partner. I saw it all...
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: That was an accident! You hear me? I
dialog: didn't know it was him!
dialog: (shakes him hard)
dialog: I didn't know it was him!
text: Just then a SHRIEK. Will looks over
text: A COUPLE KIDS. Further down the glacier. Having a snowball
dialog: fight.
text: Will looks back at Walter. Has to take it easy. Shoves him
text: away in disgust. Walter falls down onto the snow. Dislodges
dialog: his hearing aid.
text: Watches Will pace. Head throbbing. Ribs, screaming in pain.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Then why lie about it?
text: Walter brushes the snow off the dislodged hearing aid. Puts
text: it back around his ear.
speaker_heading: WALTER (cont'd)
dialog: I mean, I'm all for bending the truth.
dialog: That's what I do in my novels. It's my
dialog: trade you might say. But why cover it
dialog: up?
text: Gets up. Brushes the snow from his butt. Checks something
text: in his pocket.
speaker_heading: WALTER (cont'd)
dialog: You don't have to tell me if you don't
dialog: want to. I'm sure you have some reason.
dialog: Something noble. I have faith in that.
dialog: 
text: Looks down at the kids. Shakes his head.
speaker_heading: WALTER (cont'd)
dialog: They should be bundled up better.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: What's your game, Byrd?
text: Walter turns back to him.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: No game.
speaker_heading: WILL
text: The phone call. The knapsack.
text: Walter shrugs.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I figured we're partners on this one. I
dialog: mean, after what I saw...
text: Will stops short. Eyes burning. It's all he can do not to
dialog: throttle this weed.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Let's get one thing straight, Byrd. We are
dialog: partners on nothing.
text: Walter looks at him. Scratches his head.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I research my novels. I know the
dialog: procedures. You'd have cuffed me back at
dialog: the ferry. You'd have called for back-
dialog: up, read me my rights, and gotten a
dialog: search warrant for my apartment. You're
dialog: a well-respected detective. There's
dialog: no reason for you to be talking to me
dialog: right now...
text: He takes out a handkerchief. Blows his nose.
speaker_heading: WALTER (cont'd)
dialog: ...except that we could help each other.
text: Will stares at him.
speaker_heading: WALTER (cont'd)
dialog: So. We're at an impasse.
text: Will runs his hands through his hair. Half-crazed. Heart
text: pounding. Turns to watch...
text: THE KIDS down the glacier. Making angels in the snow. Their
text: GIGGLES carried along by the wind.
text: Will, squeezes his eyes shut. Trapped. About to defy every
text: instinct in his body.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: You're going to get a phone call.
text: Walter steps up, tapping his hearing aid.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I'm sorry?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I said you're going to get a phone call.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (perks up)
dialog: Oh?
speaker_heading: WILL
text: Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of
dialog: your books.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Thought you might find that.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You're going to be brought in for
dialog: questioning.
text: Walter smiles. Pleased.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Down at the station?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (hisses)
text: Yes down at the station.
text: Walter rubs his hands together. Thinking.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Okay. Okay. Brought in for questioning.
dialog: Good. I can write this.
text: JUST THEN the ferry blows its HORN. Low and loud. Walter
text: looks down at it.
speaker_heading: WALTER (cont'd)
text: Ferry's leaving.
text: He starts down. Will watches him pass, has no choice but to
text: follow. Walter, going over the details in his head.
speaker_heading: WALTER (cont'd)
dialog: Something to divert...
text: Snaps his fingers. An idea.
speaker_heading: WALTER (cont'd)
dialog: My gun. You still have my gun, right?
text: Will nods. Walter smiles. Spreads out his hands.
speaker_heading: WALTER (cont'd)
dialog: Then that's the wild card. Every
text: detective story has a wild card.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: What do you mean, "wild card?"
text: TOURISTS. Boarding the ferry.
speaker_heading: WALTER
text: Next ferry's in forty-five minutes.
text: Walter heads over to the ramp. Will stops, grabbing his
text: side. A PANG through his ribs. Excruciating. Calls out to
dialog: Walter.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: What do you mean "wild card?"
text: Walter looks back. Waves.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: You'll know. At the questioning.
text: Gives his ticket to the TICKET TAKER. Gets on. Walks back
text: to the stern. Looks out at Will. The HORN sounds again.
text: Walter, at the rail. Smiles. The ferry's engine, churning
text: up water. Starting forward just as...
text: Walter takes a MINI CASSETTE RECORDER from his pocket. Holds
dialog: it up for Will to see.
text: Will, on shore, sees it. A cold flash ripping through his
text: body. That motherfucker. Bolts through some tourists
dialog: towards the ramp but...
text: A couple of GUYS are just pulling it in. The Ticket Taker,
text: grabs his arm.
speaker_heading: TICKET TAKER
dialog: (to Will)
dialog: Full up.
text: Will, jerks his arm away. Stares off at the ferry. Walter
text: Byrd and his tape recorder. Receding into the distance.
scene_heading: INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHTMUTE - DAY
text: CLOSE ON a counter top. Stuff thrown down. Aspirin. Band-
text: aids. Gauze. Medical tape. First aid cream. Back pills.
text: Sleeping pills. Bottle of scotch.
text: PULL BACK to reveal Will standing at the counter in the
text: convenience store. His entire body aching. The CASHIER,
text: throws him a look.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I have a cold.
scene_heading: EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE - MINUTES LATER
text: Will exits the store. A bag under his arm. We Miss You, Kay
text: looming over his shoulder. Steps out onto the sidewalk and
dialog: sees...
text: ELLIE leaning against her truck. Waiting for him. Smiles.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Which way are you walking?
text: A tingle, all across Will's body. Christ. This girl's
text: everywhere! He hunches into his coat. Flicks up his collar.
text: Doesn't want her to see him fully. Nods down the road.
speaker_heading: WILL
text: Back to the Lodge.
text: Ellie grabs her bag. Joins him. They start walking.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: I needed to get your signature on
dialog: something.
text: She pulls a folder from her bag.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (cont'd)
text: The report on Detective Eckhart. Chief
dialog: made me finish it this morning. Said it
dialog: was taking too long.
text: Will takes the file. Flips it open. The death of his
text: partner. Neatly typed. Neatly stapled. Pulls out a pen.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (cont'd)
dialog: Aren't you going to read it?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I trust you.
text: He signs. Hands it back to her. She slips it into her bag.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (cont'd)
dialog: Now I can help you with the Connell case.
dialog: That writer's coming in tomorrow. Walter
dialog: Byrd.
text: A slight stutter in Will's step.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Duggar called him?
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: About an hour ago. Said he was more than
dialog: happy to cooperate.
text: Ellie looks over at Will as they cross the street. Studying
text: his face. His gait. Noticing the slight limp in his right
text: leg. The cut on his forehead.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (cont'd)
dialog: You haven't been sleeping much, have you,
dialog: Detective Dormer?
text: They arrive at the stone steps of the Pioneer Lodge.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Not really.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Isn't that the difference between a good
dialog: cop and a bad cop? A good cop can't
dialog: sleep 'cause a piece of the puzzle's
dialog: missing. A bad cop can't sleep 'cause
text: his conscience won't let him.
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: You said that once, remember?
text: Will, finally looks at her.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: No. But it sounds like something I
dialog: would've said.
text: Turns and starts up the steps.
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: See you tomorrow, Ellie.
text: Ellie, watches him for a second. Then calls out.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Oh! I forgot to tell you. The Puffins
dialog: won.
text: Will stops, turns to look back at her. Confused.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (cont'd)
dialog: The baseball game. Our team...
text: Slings the bag over her shoulder.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (cont'd)
dialog: ...We won.
scene_heading: INT. WILL'S ROOM - PIONEER LODGE - LATE NIGHT
text: Clock flicks to 3:00 A.M. Will, pacing in his room. Shirt
text: off. Rib cage wrapped in a bandage. Looking through...
text: A STACK OF MESSAGES. All from John Warfield. He discards
dialog: them one by one. Can barely focus...
text: SUDDENLY the phone RINGS. He lunges for it.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (grabbing it)
dialog: Listen to me, you son-of-a-bitch...
text: Interrupted by a CLICK...
speaker_heading: RECORDED VOICE
dialog: ...I saw you look right into his eyes
dialog: and shoot him...
text: Walter Byrd's voice. Recorded from that afternoon.
speaker_heading: RECORDED VOICE (cont'd)
dialog: ...Seattle's great hero. Shooting his
dialog: own partner. I saw it all...
text: Will, hears his own voice...
speaker_heading: RECORDED VOICE (cont'd)
dialog: That was an accident!...
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Goddammit, Byrd!
text: Then, another clumsy CLICK. Walter Byrd gets on.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: You'd have done the same thing, Will. I
dialog: know you would...
text: He hangs up.
text: Will SLAMS down the receiver. Then again. And again. Yanks
text: the cord out of the wall and HURLS the phone across the room.
scene_heading: EXT. ROCKY BEACH - OUTSIDE NIGHTMUTE - MORNING
text: ...The DARK FIGURE. Disappearing back into the fog. Closing
text: in around him like milky water...
text: We whip out our SMITH 39/13...plunge in after him...taking
text: chase...BREATHING hard...leaping from rock to rock...the FOG,
text: blanket thick...tightening around us...
text: Our feet. Hit water. Up to our ankles. Icy cold. We
dialog: run...sloshing through...when...
speaker_heading: SUDDENLY
text: A DARK FIGURE. Appears ahead. Big and hulking...CRASHING
dialog: towards us...
text: We raise our weapon...quick as a flash...as the FIGURE
dialog: emerges...
text: And in a split second...
text: WE LOCK EYES WITH FIGURE's - his eyes, brown and gentle...
text: CRACK! We fire! The FIGURE grips his gut, falls into the
dialog: water.
text: Heart POUNDING. Adrenaline PUMPING. We slosh towards the
dialog: body. Something...catching our eye...
speaker_heading: A 357 RUGER
text: lying in the rocks. Off to the side. We grab it. Turn back
dialog: to the body...
dialog: And stop cold.
text: That's when it hits us. That's when we realize...
scene_heading: INT. WILL'S ROOM - LATE NIGHT
text: Will bolts up. White as a sheet.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I didn't know!
text: His body, drenched in sweat. His breathing, quick and
text: ragged. Caught up in the twisted sheets of his bed. Looks
text: across the room and sees
speaker_heading: HAP
text: sitting in the corner. Eating an apple with a penknife.
speaker_heading: HAP
dialog: You sure about that, buddy?
text: He smiles. Sympathetic. Looks over at the window just as...
text: The BLANKET. Drops to the floor.
text: LIGHT floods the room.
scene_heading: INT. WILL'S ROOM - 4:02 A.M.
text: With a GRUNT Will puts his back into it. Shoving the heavy
text: oak bureau towards the window. Sweat beading his face.
text: A...few...more...shoves. And the bureau finally stands in
text: front of the window. WIll stands back to take a look. Only
text: covers half of it.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Fuck!
scene_heading: INT. WILL'S ROOM - 4:35 A.M.
text: Red-faced, Will leans into the wooden armoire. Shimmying it
text: towards the window...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. PIONEER LODGE - NIGHT
text: Ellie. Sitting in her truck. Parked behind the Pioneer
text: Lodge. Rubbbing her eyes. Sleepy. Looking up at
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILL'S WINDOW
dialog: concerned.
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. WILL'S ROOM - 4:35 A.M.
text: With one last heave, Will gets the armoire to the window.
text: Light still shining through the cracks.
scene_heading: INT. WILL'S ROOM - 4:50 A.M.
text: Will shoving magazines, blankets, sheets, pillows. Anything.
text: To fill the cracks. To cover the light. His eyes. Like a
dialog: crazy man's...
text: SUDDENLY a knock on the door. Will turns.
speaker_heading: RACHEL (O.S.)
dialog: Detective Dormer?
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Rachel standing out in the hallway. Will opens the door.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (startled by his appearance)
dialog: Will...I...
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
text: There's a guy down the hall. Complaining
dialog: about the noise.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Says he can't sleep.
text: Will gives a half-smile. Fucking irony. Heads back into...
scene_heading: INT. WILL'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: ...his room. Rachel follows. Looks around at the mess.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Are you alright?
text: Will grabs up a sweater.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I'm fine.
text: He heads back over to the window. Rachel now notices all the
text: stuff piled up. Softens her voice.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Did something happen?
text: Will. Cramming the sweater into a crack.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: No.
text: Rachel walks up behind him. His cramming, more desperate.
dialog: More urgent.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Will...
text: He grabs a magazine.
speaker_heading: WILL
text: The light. It keeps coming in...
text: Rachel reaches out. Catches his arm.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Will.
text: He stops. Looks down at her hand.
speaker_heading: RACHEL (cont'd)
dialog: What happened?
text: Will suddenly realises what he's doing. Absurd. Pathetic.
text: Pitiful. Slowly turns to face Rachel.
text: Her eyes, looking up at him. His shoulders droop.
text: Exhausted. Rachel reaches up. Catches him in her arms.
text: Strong arms. Caring. Will buries his face in her neck.
dialog: Wants to be swallowed up.
text: Rachel holds him. Arms encircling. Will breathes her in.
dialog: Sweet, soft, safe.
text: Looks up. His mouth suddenly finding hers. A kiss, hungry,
text: urgent. His arms move to surround her.
scene_heading: INT. WILL'S ROOM - LATER
text: Will and Rachel in bed. Spooning. Rachel behind will, her
text: finger tracing his scar. Rain DRUMS against the window.
text: Will. Watching the raindrops streaming down the glass.
text: Casting strange shadows against the wall.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: There was this guy named Weston Dobbs.
dialog: Twenty-four. Worked as a part-time stock
dialog: boy in a copy store. Every morning he'd
text: sit at the only window in his apartment
text: and watch an eight year-old boy get
text: picked up by his carpool across the
dialog: street. And every afternoon he'd watch
text: the boy get dropped off again. He did
dialog: this for about six months. Until one day
dialog: he got up the nerve to cross the street
text: and grab the boy before his carpool came.
text: Kept him in his apartment for three days.
dialog: Tortured him. Raped him. Made him do
dialog: things...
text: Will tenses his jaw. Rachel, listens in horror.
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
text: When he was done, he got a rope and a
text: kitchen stool and hanged the boy in the
text: basement of the apartment building. But
dialog: he didn't do a good enough job. The
text: little boy's neck didn't break and he
text: died from shock. The landlord found him
dialog: five days later.
text: Rachel reaches for Will's hand. Squeezes it.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: One of your cases?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Me and Hap. A year and a half ago. I
dialog: knew the second I met Dobbs that he was
text: guilty. Smug, cold. Dead eyes. We had
text: circumstantial evidence, but nothing to
dialog: tie him to it. Nothing concrete. Went
text: over every inch of that apartment.
text: He pauses.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: What happened?
text: Will turns slowly over to face her. Her hair, splayed out on
text: the pillow. Her cheeks, flushed. Her eyes, listening.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: We took some blood samples from the boy's
text: body and planted them in his apartment.
dialog: (beat)
text: Arrested him the next day.
text: Rachel looks at him. Goose pimples on her arms. Realising
text: the weight of the confession.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Will.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: There've been other cases. Where we've
text: changed results. Pushed witnesses.
text: Manipulated evidence.
dialog: (rubs his face)
dialog: But Dobbs. I wanted Dobbs more than
dialog: anything.
text: He sits up. Abrupt. Wincing from the pain in his ribs.
text: Rests his arms on his knees.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: What if someone finds out?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: We're under investigation now. Back in
dialog: Seattle.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Hap wanted to talk. As soon as we got
dialog: back. Thought he could work out some
dialog: kind of deal.
text: Rachel rubs his shoulder.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Well, that's not going to happen now.
text: Will closes his eyes. The rain, PATTERING. Rhythmic.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Do you think it was wrong? What we did?
text: There's a PAUSE. Rachel, studying Will's back. The cuts.
text: The bruises. Not sure how to answer.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: There are two kinds of people in Alaska.
dialog: Those who were born here and those who've
dialog: come here to escape something in their
dialog: lives.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I wasn't born here, Will. I'm in no
dialog: position to judge anyone. I'm not about
dialog: that any more.
text: Looks out the window.
speaker_heading: RACHEL (cont'd)
dialog: It's all about what you're willing to
dialog: live with.
scene_heading: INT. WILL'S ROOM - MORNING
text: The clock reads 6:00. Will pulls on his trousers. Goes to
text: strap on his Smith 39/13 holster. Grimaces with pain. Looks
text: at his back in the full-length mirror. BLACK BRUISES seeping
text: out from under his bandage.
text: Puts the 39/13 and holster in the top drawer of the bureau.
text: Turns and looks down at Rachel. Sleeping soundly.
speaker_heading: FRED (O.S.)
dialog: You were acquainted with the deceased,
dialog: Kay Connell?
scene_heading: INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Will in the interrogation room. Standing by the window.
text: Tensed jaw.
speaker_heading: WALTER (O.S.)
dialog: Yes I was.
speaker_heading: WALTER BYRD
text: sits at the table. Hair combed, wet. Shirt newly starched.
text: A Styrofoam cup of coffee in front of him. Playing the part.
text: Fred sits opposite him. Report file open. Ellie, next to
text: Fred. Taking notes. She's combed her hair, too.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: In what manner?
text: Walter smiles modestly. Looks over at Ellie.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: She was, not quite a "fan." More an avid
dialog: reader of my detective novels.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: When did you first meet her?
text: Fred shoots Ellie a look. She closes her mouth.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: A year ago. At one of my signings.
text: Ellie hands Fred the hardback of Otherwise Engaged. He holds
text: it up. Opened to the signature.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Where you signed this?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: What happened at that signing?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: She flattered me about my writing. Asked
dialog: if she could visit me. To talk about my
dialog: books.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Did she?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Yes. Not that much at first. But then
dialog: she became more comfortable. Started
dialog: visiting me every week...
text: Will, from over by the window. Interrupts.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: What was the nature of your relationship?
text: Walter looks over. Wide-eyed.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: What do you mean, Detective Dormer?
text: Will turns. Accusatory.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: She was an attractive girl. Did you have
dialog: sex with her?
text: Walter blinks.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: She was only seventeen.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: But she was an attractive girl.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I suppose.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Did you have sex with her?
text: Fred shoots Will a look. Ellie, watching him.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: But you wanted to.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I was a mentor to her.
text: Will heads over to Walter's chair. Fists clenched in his
dialog: pockets.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You gave her gifts.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: WILL
text: Expensive dresses. A heart necklace.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Doesn't sound like a mentor to me.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I gave her things she didn't have.
dialog: Couldn't have.
text: He turns to Fred and Ellie.
speaker_heading: WALTER (cont'd)
text: Her family lives on Mr. Connell's
dialog: disability. It isn't much.
text: Fred stops Will with a look. Had enough.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: We understand, Mr. Byrd.
dialog: (to Will)
dialog: You want to sit down, Detective?
text: Tense BEAT. Will stares at Walter. Revulsion. Heads back
text: over to the window.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: She wasn't happy. I was someone to talk
dialog: to.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: How do you mean?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: That boyfriend. Randy.
text: Fred, sits up.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Randy Stetz?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: What about him?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: He. Well, he...
text: Walter hesitates. Takes a sip of coffee.
speaker_heading: WALTER (cont'd)
dialog: I don't want to talk out of school. Kay
dialog: told me things in the strictest of
dialog: confidence. As a friend.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Mr. Byrd. Anything you can tell us could
dialog: help out with this case.
text: Walter furrows his brow. Taps his hearing aid.
speaker_heading: WALTER
text: Well. He hit her.
text: Ellie's eyes widen. Fred glances at Will. But Will's too
text: busy watching this little man weave his web.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Are you sure about that?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: She'd come to me, sometimes in the middle
text: of the night. Bruises all over her back,
text: her upper arms. I pled with her to let
dialog: me call the police, but she wouldn't hear
dialog: it. Wanted to keep it a secret.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Randy Stetz beat Kay Connell?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: (angry)
dialog: Ellie.
text: Walter looks right at her.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: He has a terrible rage. Kay even said he
text: carried a handgun around with him.
text: Fred stands. This is big. Calls out the door.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Margaret! Get Judge Biggs on the phone!
dialog: (to Will)
dialog: I'll get another warrant for Stetz's
dialog: place.
text: Walter takes a sip of his coffee. Cup's empty. Holds it out
text: to Ellie. Smiles.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Could I have some more coffee, Detective
dialog: Burr?
text: Ellie nods, takes the cup. Heads over to the coffee machine.
text: Fred turns back to the door...
text: AND AT THAT MOMENT Walter levels a look right at Will.
text: Mouths the words Wild Card.
text: A shiver down Will's spine. Wild card. The gun. Randy.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
text: over at the coffee machine. Pouring coffee. Glances up at
text: the window. Catches the reflection of the two men.
text: An intense look between them.
scene_heading: EXT. ROCKY BEACH - OUTSIDE NIGHTMUTE - DAY
text: CLOSE ON a BOOT. Jumping down onto a black rock.
text: PULL BACK to reveal Ellie walking out on the beach. Heading
text: down towards the water. Thinking.
scene_heading: INT. RANDY STETZ'S ROOM - NIGHTMUTE - DAY
text: A dark, narrow boarding room. A HAND reaches through an open
text: window. Feels for the lock on the door. CLICK.
text: Will enters Randy Stetz's place. Cigarette butts, electric
text: guitar, Hustler centerfolds tacked on the walls.
text: He looks around. Every inch of him revolting against what
text: he's about to do.
scene_heading: EXT. ROCKY BEACH - CONTINUOUS
text: The sound of waves. A slight breeze. Ellie walking along
dialog: the water.
text: Looking down. Brow furrowed. Stops and puts her hands on
text: her hips.
scene_heading: INT. RANDY STETZ'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Will heads over to a hanging sheet on the other side of the
text: room. Pulls it aside. A MOTORBIKE being repaired. Parts
text: and tools all over the place.
text: Pulls the 357 Ruger from his pocket with a handkerchief.
text: Spots a COFFEE CAN on a shelf. Filled with thick oil.
scene_heading: EXT. ROCKY BEACH - CONTINUOUS
text: Something catches Ellie's eye. GLINTING from between the
text: rocks. She bends down. Pulls a pencil from her backpack.
text: Spears something and holds it up.
text: A SHELL CASING.
scene_heading: INT. RANDY STETZ'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Will, drops the 357 into the oil. Turns and heads back
text: across the room. Hesitates. At the door. Turns back.
text: Looking at the oil can. Takes a step back towards it when he
dialog: hears...
text: The sound of a SQUAD CAR. Pulling up outside.
dialog: Too late.
scene_heading: EXT. RANDY STETZ'S ROOM - LATER
text: Will stands just outside the doorway into Randy's room.
text: UNIFORMED OFFICERS inside searching the place. Tearing down
text: pictures. Turning out doors. Ripping up carpet. Randy's
text: voice. In protest.
speaker_heading: RANDY (O.S.)
dialog: You can't fucking do this!
text: Will hears some SCUFFLING. The sheet being pulled down. The
text: CLATTER of tools.
speaker_heading: RANDY (O.S.)
dialog: Hey! I'm working on that!
text: Parts pulled off the shelves. The bike, shoved to the side.
text: Then. A SILENCE. Followed by...
speaker_heading: OFFICER (O.S.)
dialog: Found something.
text: Will shuts his eyes. Heavy FOOTSTEPS head over to the bike.
text: Someone's pulled the gun from the can.
speaker_heading: RANDY (O.S.)
dialog: What the fuck is that!
text: Fred's voice, calm.
speaker_heading: FRED (O.S.)
dialog: That's it. Let's bag it.
text: More FOOTSTEPS. Randy, desperate.
speaker_heading: RANDY (O.S.)
dialog: That's not mine, man! That's not mine!
text: Will opens his eyes. Fred's voice. Almost sympathetic.
speaker_heading: FRED (O.S.)
dialog: Randy...
speaker_heading: RANDY (O.S.)
dialog: No way, man!
text: More SCUFFLING. A chair knocked over. Something SMASHES.
text: Will looks down at the floor as
text: FRED AND A UNIFORMED COP struggle to drag Randy through the
text: doorway. Randy writhes, kicks, tugs. Screams.
speaker_heading: RANDY (cont'd)
dialog: That ain't mine!
text: Fred grabs Randy's shoulder.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: C'mon, Randy.
text: Randy squirms. Turns. Looks right into Will's eyes. Gone
text: is the bluster. Gone is the attitude. Randy Stetz, lost
text: kid. Tears streaming down his face.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: I swear to God. I didn't kill her. I
dialog: swear to God...
scene_heading: EXT. GARAGE APARTMENT - DAY
text: Will stands outside the garage apartment. Wind whipping his
text: coat. Watches as a Nightmute PD SQUAD CAR pulls off with
text: Randy Stetz in the back.
text: Fred sees him, heads over.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: You look like shit, cowboy.
text: Will shifts his eyes to him.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: That's an understatement.
text: Fred half-smiles. Watches the receding squad car.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Looks like we can wrap this one up.
text: Will barely nods. Fred pulls his baseball cap on.
speaker_heading: FRED (cont'd)
dialog: We're getting together for a couple of
dialog: beers later on. Might not be the Seattle
dialog: thing to do. But you're welcome to come.
text: Fred puts out his hand to shake. Truce. Will looks at him.
dialog: Takes it.
scene_heading: INT. SHANTY BAR - NIGHTMUTE - NIGHT
text: CLOSE ON a tray of dark beer. Five glasses, foam sloshing.
speaker_heading: FARRELL (O.S.)
dialog: I can't believe it. Randy Stetz.
text: PULL BACK to reveal Farrell, Rich, Francis, and Will sitting
text: at a small, round table. Fred's passing out the beers. Dive
text: bar. MUSIC blaring. 3 a.m. Happy Hour! banner on the wall.
text: Place packed with rough-looking FISHERMEN.
text: Rich takes a glass from Fred.
speaker_heading: RICH
dialog: What do you mean, you can't believe it?
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: He was an asshole.
speaker_heading: FARRELL
dialog: That doesn't mean anything.
text: Fred sits. Takes a sip of his beer. To Farrell.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Didn't you grow up with him?
text: Farrell shifts in his seat.
speaker_heading: FARRELL
dialog: Our dads were on the same boat.
dialog: (to Will)
dialog: We used to wait for them together.
text: Will nods. Jostled by the crowd. Reaches for his beer.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: He used to pick fights at the gas
dialog: station.
speaker_heading: RICH
dialog: And remember when he did all those donut
dialog: holes that one summer?
text: He and Francis GUFFAW.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Just a bad seed.
text: Farrell looks over at Will.
speaker_heading: FARRELL
dialog: How do you like our beer?
text: Will slams down his empty glass. Squeezes his eyes open and
text: shut. Loud music. Cigarette smoke.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I like it fine.
text: Fred pats Will's shoulder.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: What Detective Dormer needs is a little
text: shut-eye.
speaker_heading: RICH
dialog: The white nights been hard on you?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: They haven't been easy.
text: Francis grabs a handful of peanuts.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: They don't have titanium shades over at
dialog: the Pioneer.
speaker_heading: RICH
dialog: Well no wonder.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: You lose all sense of time.
speaker_heading: FARRELL
dialog: Better than Fred's home town.
text: Will turns to Fred. Wiping the foam from his moustache.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: My people are from Barrow. Way up north.
speaker_heading: RICH
dialog: In the winter there's no sunlight for
dialog: five straight months.
speaker_heading: FRED
text: Like being swallowed up in a black hole.
scene_heading: JUST THEN.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (O.S.)
dialog: Hi, guys.
text: They look up. Ellie standing by their table. Jeans, down
text: vest. Hair tousled.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Nancy Drew! Pull up a seat!
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: You hear what happened, Ellie?
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: RICH
dialog: Pretty cool.
speaker_heading: FARRELL
dialog: Rich found the gun.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: I know. I heard.
text: Fred leans back in his seat. Eyeballs Ellie.
speaker_heading: FRED
text: Something's on Nancy's mind.
text: Ellie reaches into her vest pocket. Pulls out a Ziploc with
text: the SHELL CASING inside.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: I found this out on the beach.
speaker_heading: FARRELL
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: ELLIE
text: Shell casing. 9mm.
text: Will, blanches.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Let it go, Ell. We got the bad guy.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: None of us carries a 9mm duty weapon.
dialog: And the murder weapon was a 357.
text: Rich throws peanut shells at her.
speaker_heading: RICH
dialog: Get a hobby, will ya?
text: Ellie brushes off the shells. Looks right at Will.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: It's a legitimate point, isn't it,
dialog: Detective Dormer?
text: Everyone turns to Will. Their faces, spinning. He nods.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: It's legitimate.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Worth pursuing?
text: He looks up. Holds her gaze. Then turns away. Grabs the
text: side of the table.
speaker_heading: WILL
text: The case is closed, Ellie.
dialog: (gets up)
dialog: I got the next round.
text: The guys don't protest. Will starts heading for the bar.
text: Weaving through broad shoulders, massive backs. Smoke.
text: MUSIC. Laughter. Arguing. A mass of bodies and sound.
text: Like being swallowed up in a black hole...
text: Looks back at the table.
dialog: 
text: Ellie, watching him.
scene_heading: EXT. ELLIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. FRONT HALLWAY - HOUSE - NIGHT
text: SLAM! Ellie heads through the front door like a gust of
text: wind. Thunders up the stairs. Calls out.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Me, Pop!
text: We hear the TV in the other room. An older MAN, Ellie's
text: father, appears in the doorway. Thick glasses, grey stubble,
text: big paunch. Wearing a flannel robe.
speaker_heading: ELLIE'S DAD
dialog: Ellie? You okay?
text: Ellie appears at the top of the stairs.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Where's all my academy stuff?
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT
text: Pitch black, then, CLICK! as a bare lightbulb's switched on.
text: Ellie stands beneath it. Piles of crap everywhere.
text: She steps through the quagmire of old bikes, fans, auto
text: parts. Over to a stack of cardboard BOXES in the corner.
text: She nudges through them, reading the writing on the tops. In
text: thick black pen. Shoves a couple aside.
text: Then. Finds what she's looking for. Pulls down a box
text: marked: Ellie Acad. Tears it open.
text: INSIDE - piles of papers, polaroids of her and her FRIENDS,
text: schedules, syllabi, handbooks. Stuff from her Academy year.
text: At the bottom, a report. The title: "Securing the Crime
text: Scene," the Leland Street Murders. By Eleanor P. Burr.
text: Ellie pulls it out. Sits down on an old stool. Opens to the
text: middle of the report. Her finger, tracing down the
text: typewritten page. Flips to the next page. Then the next.
text: The next. Then. She spots it.
text: THREE-QUARTERS DOWN THE PAGE, her finger finds the
text: sentence:...Detective Dormer's unregistered Smith and Wesson
text: model 39/13 9mm, to immobilize Langley...

scene_heading: EXT. MARINERS MEMORIAL - OUTSIDE NIGHTMUTE - DAY
text: CLOSE ON a huge wave CRASHING against a retaining wall.

text: clouds.
scene_heading: INT. MARINER'S MEMORIAL - CONTINUOUS
text: Walter Byrd waits under the Mariner's Memorial. Wind
text: whipping his jacket, the green sea churning behind him. Next
text: to a fifteen-foot statue of a SEAMAN, tall, rugged, tough.
text: Holding on to a thick coil of rope.
text: Hunches against the wind. Watches as...
dialog: 
text: WILL approaches the monument. Sonics sweatshirt, wrinkled
text: coat. Face drawn and haggard. Angry.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Hi, Will...
text: Will enters the monument.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: What the hell are you doing calling me at
dialog: the station?
text: A gust of wind WHORLS through the monument.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I figured we should touch base. Compare
dialog: notes. I think it went well. What did
dialog: you think?
text: Will's eyes pierce into him.
speaker_heading: WILL
text: Randy Stetz is in jail.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Told you I could write an ending.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Congratulations.
text: Will holds out his hand.
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
text: The tape.
text: Walter looks at the open hand. Hugs his jacket to him.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I thought maybe we could talk some more.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: There's nothing more to talk about.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: But we work so well together...
text: Will breaks. Rushes Walter. Slams him against one of the
text: concrete pilasters.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: We do nothing well together.
dialog: (SLAMS him again)
dialog: Nothing! You understand me?
text: Another wave CRASHES. Sprays them. Walter looks up into
text: Will's bloodshot eyes.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: You run on two settings, Will. I've
dialog: noticed that...
text: Will tightens his grip.
speaker_heading: WALTER (cont'd)
dialog: You jump from calm to rage in the blink
dialog: of an eye. That's okay. I do that too.
text: He holds up the tape. Will grabs it, shoves Walter to the
text: side. Yanks the tape out of the cassette. Steps back and
text: HURLS it into the sea. Waves engulf it hungrily.
text: Walter watches him.
speaker_heading: WALTER (cont'd)
dialog: You're not sleeping, are you?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: What the hell do you know?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Kay told me. She comes to me, you know.
dialog: Tells me things. About you. About me.
speaker_heading: PAUSE.
speaker_heading: WALTER (cont'd)
dialog: Does Detective Eckhart come to you?
text: Will curls his fists.
speaker_heading: WALTER (cont'd)

dialog: Whips around...
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I told you that was an accident!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Then so was mine...
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Don't you pull that shit with me.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I didn't want to kill her, Will.
text: Steps closer to him. Beseeching.
speaker_heading: WALTER (cont'd)
dialog: When she called me that night from the
text: party, she'd had a fight with Randy.
dialog: Wanted to talk. I told her to meet me at
dialog: our special place. The cabin at the
dialog: beach...
text: A couple RAVENS alight nearby. Flapping their wings.
text: SCREECHING into the wind.
speaker_heading: WALTER (cont'd)
dialog: ...When she came she was barefoot. And
dialog: there was liquor on her breath. I only
dialog: wanted to comfort her. To touch her.
dialog: She could have at least let me do that.
dialog: Her skin...it was like everything I'd
dialog: ever written about.
text: A dark shadow crosses his face. Holds on to the coiled rope
text: of the statue. Will hisses.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Couldn't get it up, Walter?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: It was when I went to kiss her. She
dialog: started laughing. I got angry. After
dialog: all I'd given her. All I'd shared with
dialog: her. I just wanted to make her stop.
dialog: That's all.
text: Walter. Squeezing the bronze rope.
speaker_heading: WALTER (cont'd)
text: From calm to rage in the blink of an eye.
text: Locks eyes with Will. Conspiratorial.
speaker_heading: WALTER (cont'd)

speaker_heading: WALTER (cont'd)
dialog: The never coming back part, though. I'm
dialog: not sure. To tell you the truth this has

speaker_heading: ELLIE'S HAND
text: slips down his back. Feeling for a holster. For that 39/13.
text: Nothing. She breaks away.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (cont'd)
dialog: We're really going to miss you around

speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: We're on the same side, Will. You know

text: Will takes a step forward...
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: That's where you're wrong, Walter.
text: Slowly reaches into his jacket...
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)

scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Will, on his feet, trying to focus. His suit, soaked with
text: blood. Looking for his gun. Spots it, in the corner...
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY

scene_heading: INT. BOATHOUSE
text: The boathouse. Old, rotted wood. Crumbling beams.

text: WALTER at the far window.
text: Will jerks back. Steps on the dock. A plank CREAKS. Shit.
text: Peers back through the window.
dialog: 
text: WALTER. Still looking out. Didn't hear a thing.

text: out, falls. Drops into the icy water below.
text: SILENCE. Will steps over to the hole. Looks down at
dialog: 
text: WALTER, floating on his back. Looking up at him. Water

speaker_heading: WILL
text: Another J. Brody mystery.
scene_heading: EXT. BOATHOUSE
text: Will staggers out on to the dock. Drops his gun. Crashes to

speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Why?

speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Because I just couldn't be wrong.
dialog: (looks at her)
dialog: Don't ever get that way, Ellie. Don't

text: His blood, pumping out in rivulets. Ellie looks down at him.
text: Her hero. Moves up to the wound in his arm.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: This one looks worse.
text: Will reaches up a feeble hand. Stops her.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Just let me sleep, Ellie...
text: His eyelids, growing heavy.
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: Let me sleep.
text: Ellie blinks away the tears. Knows what he means. What he

text: Will closes his eyes.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: No!
text: Will opens his eyes. She ties the second sock around his
dialog: arm.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (cont'd)
dialog: I will not let you sleep. If you've lost
dialog: your way then you have to make it right.
dialog: That's the only way. That's what you'd
dialog: tell me. I've been a detective for four
dialog: weeks and I say you're coming with me.
text: She gets up. Slips her arms under his shoulders. Starts
text: hoisting him up.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (cont'd)
dialog: C'mon...
text: Will. Struggling to his knees. Every inch of him, screaming

speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: What about your shoulder?
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Don't worry. I'll have a cool scar.
