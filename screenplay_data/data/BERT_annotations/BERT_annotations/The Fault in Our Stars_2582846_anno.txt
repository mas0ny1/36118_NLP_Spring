dialog: Written by

dialog: Based on the novel by
dialog: John Green

dialog: 
dialog: May 1, 2012
speaker_heading: FIRST DRAFT
text: HAZEL GRACE LANCASTER (16) lies in the grass, staring up at
text: the stars. We're CLOSE ON her FACE and we hear:
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: You have a choice in this world, I
dialog: believe, about how to tell sad
dialog: stories.
text: CUT TO a SERIES OF QUICK IMAGES:
dialog: - Hazel and the BOY we will come to know as AUGUSTUS "GUS"
text: WATERS (17) at an outdoor restaurant in some magical place.
dialog: [They look very much like the perfect Hollywood couple.]
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: On the one hand, you can sugar coat
dialog: - the way they do in movies and
dialog: romance novels.
text: - "Perfect" Hazel and "Perfect" Gus sit on a BENCH
text: overlooking an incredible seascape in some foreign country.
text: She rests her head on his shoulder.
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: Where villains are vanquished
dialog: and... heroes are born and...
text: - "Perfect" Hazel and "Perfect" Gus kiss in a dark room.
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: ... beautiful people learn
dialog: beautiful lessons...
text: - "Perfect" Hazel and "Perfect" Gus fall onto a bed together.
text: They look deep into one another's eyes.
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: ... and nothing is too messed up
dialog: that can't be fixed with an apology
text: and a Peter Gabriel song.
text: BACK TO Hazel on the grass, still watching the stars. Were
dialog: those dreams or were they memories? Still unclear.
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: I like that way as much as the next
dialog: girl, believe me. It's just not the
dialog: truth.
text: Hazel closes her eyes.
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: This is the truth.
text: And EVERYTHING GOES BLACK. We HEAR:
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: FADE IN ON:
dialog: 2.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
text: The real Hazel is no less beautiful than the one we just saw.
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: Late in the Winter of my 17th
dialog: year...
text: There are, however, some key and obvious differences.
text: First, you'll notice the OXYGEN TUBE in her nostrils which
dialog: help her to breathe.
dialog: Second, you'll notice her hair - which we couldn't see in the
text: grass. It's much shorter than the "Perfect" version, the
dialog: result of someone whose head was completely shaved a few
dialog: years before.
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: ... my mother decided I was
dialog: depressed.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I'm not depressed.
text: Hazel's legs dangle over the side of an exam table. Her
text: mother FRANNIE (early 40s, younger than she feels) explains
speaker_heading: to the DOCTOR:
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: ... she eats like a bird. She
text: barely leaves the house,
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I'm not depressed.
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: ... she reads the same book over
dialog: and over...
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
text: She's depressed.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I'm not depressed!
text: Off her look, CUT TO:
text: QUICK SEQUENCE, which play over:
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: The booklets and web sites always
dialog: list depression as a side effect of
dialog: cancer...
text: - A SHOPPING MALL. Filled with TEENAGE GIRLS - gossipping,
text: laughing - being teenage girls, basically. And here's Hazel.
text: With her Mom. And her oxygen tank. Just another day.
dialog: 3.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: Depression's not a side effect of
dialog: cancer...
text: - HAZEL'S LIVING ROOM. She sits watching game shows in the
text: middle of the afternoon. Her Mom brings her a sandwich. A
text: glass of water. And then a whole host of prescription meds.
text: Hazel eyes them with indifference.
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: ... it's a side effect of dying.
text: - A STARBUCKS. Hazel sits alone reading a dog-eared, heavily
text: underlined copy of a novel ("An Imperial Affliction" by Peter
text: Van Houten). She only looks up when distracted by a squeal of
text: delight. A YOUNG GUY has lifted a YOUNG GIRL over his
text: shoulder playfully. He spins her around. Hazel watches a beat
text: - goes back to the book.
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: Which is what was happening to me.
dialog: And we CUT BACK TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT DOCTOR'S OFFICE - SAME
text: Frannie continues to talk to the doctor. Hazel continues to
text: dangle her feet.
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: ... some days she won't even get
text: out of bed.
text: The Doctor scratches his beard, thinking.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: I may switch you to Zoloft. Or
dialog: Lexapro. And twice a day instead of
dialog: once.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Why stop there?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Hmm?
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Keep `em coming. I can take it. I'm
dialog: like the Keith Richards of cancer
dialog: kids.
text: The Doctor looks at Frannie who just shakes her head.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Have you been going to that Support
dialog: Group I suggested?
text: Instead of answering, Hazel looks at her Mom.
dialog: 4.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: She's gone a few times.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I'm not sure it's for me.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: If you're depressed --
speaker_heading: HAZEL
speaker_heading: (EXASPERATED)
dialog: I'm not de--
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
speaker_heading: (IGNORING HER)
dialog: -- support Groups are a great way
dialog: to connect with people who are...
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
text: On the same journey.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: "Journey?" Really?
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: Hazel.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Just give it a chance, ok? For me.
text: Hazel rolls her eyes, knows she's lost this battle.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Who knows? You might even find
dialog: it... enlightening.
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT CHURCH BASEMENT - DAY
text: CLOSE UP on PATRICK (30s, pony-tail). He has a guitar.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: ... we are gathered here today -
dialog: literally - in the heart of Jesus.
text: ANGLE on Hazel who just shakes her head. This is the lamest
dialog: thing she could be doing right now.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Who would like to share their story
dialog: with the group?
text: The basement is filled with SICK PEOPLE. Hazel among them.
scene_heading: Most are under the age of 18. QUICK CUTS:
dialog: 5.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPEAKER #1
dialog: Jillian. 15. Lymphoma.
speaker_heading: SPEAKER #2
dialog: Angel. 17. Ewing sarcoma.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
text: Patrick. 34. Testicular. It started
dialog: a few years ago, when I was...
text: As Hazel watches, bored, and Patrick continues, we hear:
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: I'll spare you the gory details of
dialog: Patrick's ball cancer. Basically,
dialog: they found it in his nuts, cut most
dialog: of it out, he almost died, but he
dialog: didn't die, and now here he is -
text: divorced, friendless, addicted to
dialog: video games, exploiting his
text: cancertastic past in the heart of
dialog: Jesus - "literally" - to show us
dialog: that one day - if we're lucky - we
dialog: could be just like him.
dialog: They all say:
speaker_heading: ALL IN UNISON
dialog: "We're here for you Patrick."
text: Hazel says it the least enthusiastically. She locks eyes with
text: her only friend in Support Group, a blonde kid with an eye
text: patch, ISAAC. He's also shaking his head.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Who else would like to share?
speaker_heading: (NO RESPONSE)
dialog: Hazel?
text: Oh no. Patrick gestures for her to speak. Reluctantly she
text: stands, sighs...
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I'm, uh, Hazel. 16.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Thyroid originally but with quite
text: the impressive satellite colony in
dialog: my lungs.
text: Not much more to say, Hazel is about to sit down.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: And how are you doing Hazel?
text: Hazel has no idea how to answer that.
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: You mean besides the terminal
dialog: cancer?
dialog: 6.
dialog: 
dialog: But that's not what she says. She says:
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Alright? I guess...?
text: Isaac tries not to laugh at this. Hazel sits back down.
speaker_heading: ALL IN UNISON
dialog: "We're here for you Hazel."
text: Hazel exhales. This is not at all helpful. A few more beats.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Maybe now I'll play a song...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT CHURCH - LATER
text: Frannie sits in the car in the parking lot, reading from a
text: book, waiting for Group to be over. She sees the church door
text: open and puts the book away. Hazel comes out. Frannie looks
text: at her like "well, was it great?" Hazel just exhales and gets
text: in the car. CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT HAZEL'S LIVING ROOM - ANOTHER DAY
text: "America's Next Top Model" is on the TV. Hazel sits on one
text: side of the L-shaped couch, flipping through her novel.
text: Frannie and Hazel's dad MICHAEL (40s, kind, doing his best to
text: stay positive) sit on the other side, watching her - but
text: trying not to make it seem that way. After a few beats:
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
text: It's Friday night.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Hmm?
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: I was just thinking... you should
dialog: call your friends, see what they're
dialog: up to.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
speaker_heading: (DISINTERESTED)
dialog: That's ok.
text: Frannie and Michael look at one another, don't say anything.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Wanna see a movie?
text: Hazel looks up from the book. Sees her parents. Gets an idea.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Why don't you guys go to a movie?
dialog: (off their look)
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 7.
speaker_heading: HAZEL (CONT'D)
dialog: You haven't been out in a while.
dialog: Go. Have fun. Take the night off.
text: Frannie and Michael look at one another again.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: This is a really good show.
text: Hazel sighs. And just like that, everyone goes back to what
text: they were doing. CUT TO:
text: QUICK SEQUENCE, which plays over:
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: And that was my life.
text: - Hazel watching TV, book in hand.
text: - Hazel in another doctor's office.
dialog: - Hazel popping pills.
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: Reality shows. Doctor's
dialog: appointments. Eight prescription
dialog: drugs, three times a day.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT HAZEL'S KITCHEN - ANOTHER DAY
text: Hazel and her parents in the kitchen.
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: And worse worse worst of all...
dialog: support group.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Ugh. You can't make me.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Of course we can, we're your
dialog: parents.
text: Hazel frowns.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Hazel, you need to get out of the
dialog: house. Make friends. Be a teenager.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: If you want me to be a teenager,
dialog: don't send me to Support Group. Buy
dialog: me a fake ID so I can go to clubs
dialog: and drink gimlets and take pot.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You don't take pot.
dialog: 8.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: See, that's the kind of thing I
dialog: would know with a fake ID.
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Get in the car.
text: Hazel mock stabs herself in the stomach with an invisible
dialog: sword. CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT CHURCH - ESTABLISHING
text: A small Episcopalian sanctuary in suburban Indianapolis.
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: And so I went...
text: Frannie's car pulls up close to the back entrance.
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: Not because I wanted to or because
dialog: I thought it would help. But for
dialog: the same reason I did anything
dialog: these days...
text: Hazel, oxygen tank in toe, gets out of the car with Frannie's
dialog: assistance.
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: ... to make my parents happy.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Are you gonna sit here and wait the
dialog: whole time?
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: Of course not, no. I...
dialog: (she totally is)
dialog: I have errands to run.
text: Hazel knows she's not planning to run any errands. She
text: doesn't press the issue.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Ok.
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: Love you.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Love you too Mom.
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: The only thing worse than biting it
dialog: from cancer - is having a kid bite
dialog: it from cancer.
text: As Frannie gets back in the car, she shouts to her daughter:
dialog: 9.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: Make some friends!
text: Hazel just shakes her head. CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT CHURCH - SAME
text: Hazel walks towards the elevator. An EXTREMELY SICK LOOKING
text: KID holds it open for her. Hazel thinks better of it.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I'll take the stairs.
text: The KID nods. The doors shut. Hazel is reminded - it could
text: always be worse. She turns to go, walking right into:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUS HAZEL
dialog: Ooph. Sorry!
dialog: 
text: A SUPREMELY BEAUTIFUL BOY (we will come to know him as GUS).
text: Tall, lean, muscular, straight short mahogany hair, blue
text: eyes. Hazel has never seen a better looking kid in her life.
speaker_heading: GUS HAZEL
dialog: My bad. No, it's...
dialog: 
text: For a brief moment, the Earth stops. They stand looking at
text: one another. Hazel is speechless.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Excuse me.
text: With the Beautiful Boy watching, a wan smile on his face,
text: Hazel shuffles off as fast as she can, ducking into:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT BATHROOM - SAME
text: Hazel catches her breath. Shakes her head. Surprised at
dialog: herself.
text: She looks in the mirror. So doesn't like what she sees. The
text: Earth starts moving again. CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT CHURCH BASEMENT - LATER
text: Hazel sits in the Circle of Sick.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Who would like to begin?
text: No volunteers. Hazel catches sight of the Beautiful Boy,
text: sitting next to Isaac. He seems to be watching her, that same
text: flirty smile on his face. She self-consciously looks away.
dialog: 10.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Isaac, I know you're facing a
dialog: challenging time. Perhaps you would
dialog: like to say something...
text: Isaac nods, rises.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Yeah, um... I'm Isaac. 17. Eye
dialog: cancer.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
text: It's looking like another surgery
dialog: in a couple weeks. After which,
dialog: well, I'll be blind...
text: Hazel tries to focus on what Isaac's saying but it's
text: difficult. She still feels the Beautiful Boy's gaze on her.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Not that I'm complaining or
dialog: anything. I know a lot of you have
dialog: it way worse but, still, I mean,
dialog: you know, being blind's gonna
dialog: suck...
text: As Isaac shares, the Beautiful Boy doesn't look away from
text: Hazel. Hazel finds this intimidating. And intimidation
text: irritates her. So she decides to play the game with him,
text: meeting his gaze and holding it just as firmly.
text: A staring contest.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: ...My girlfriend helps. And friends
dialog: like Augustus here...
text: Isaac nods towards the Beautiful Boy who now has a name -
text: AUGUSTUS. He still doesn't look away from Hazel.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: So... yeah. That's what's up.
speaker_heading: ALL IN UNISON
dialog: "We're here for you Isaac."
text: The staring contest continues another few beats until:
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: And does your friend want to speak?
text: This causes the Beautiful Boy to momentarily look away. Aha,
text: he's lost the contest! Hazel smiles, flicks her eyebrows up
text: as if to say "Victory is mine!" He smiles back at her, the
text: most radiant smile on the planet. He turns back to the Group.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Hi. I'm Augustus Waters. 17. Had a
dialog: touch of osteosarcoma bout a year
dialog: and a half ago - lost this baby as
dialog: a result...
dialog: 11.
dialog: 
text: Gus holds up his right leg - a prosthetic.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: But really I'm just here at Isaac's
dialog: request.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: And how are you feeling Augustus?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Me? Oh I'm grand. I'm on a roller
dialog: coaster that only goes up, my
dialog: friend.
text: Hazel smiles. Gus catches this. Embarrassed, she stops
text: smiling and looks away.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Perhaps you'd like to share your
dialog: fears with the group, Augustus.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: My fears?
text: Gus thinks about this.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Oblivion.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Oblivion?
text: ANGLE ON Hazel, intrigued.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Yeah, see... I intend to live an
dialog: extraordinary life. To be
dialog: remembered. If I'm scared of
dialog: anything it's... not doing that.
text: Patrick doesn't quite have the tools to deal with that.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Would, uh, anyone like to speak to
dialog: that?
text: And Hazel's hand goes up. Even Patrick is surprised by that.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Hazel! That's unexpected.
text: Hazel stands, takes a second to gather her thoughts. Augustus
text: watches her, waits for it.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I just wanna say... there will come
dialog: a time when, you know, all of us
dialog: are dead.
text: Gus is now even more fixed on her than before.
dialog: 12.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: It might be tomorrow. Might be a
dialog: million years from now but... it's
dialog: gonna happen. And when it does,
dialog: enough generations will come and
dialog: go, there'll be no one left to
dialog: remember Cleopatra. Or Mozart. Or
dialog: Muhammad Ali, let alone any of us,
dialog: right?
text: The look on Gus's face is unreadable.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Oblivion's inevitable. And if that
dialog: scares you, well, I suggest you
dialog: ignore it. God knows it's what
text: everyone else does.
text: A beat. And then an enormous smile spreads across Gus's face,
text: not a flirty smile but a surprised one, a real one. CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT OUTSIDE THE CHURCH - LATER
text: Hazel waits for her Mom's car to appear.
text: Across the parking lot, she sees Isaac going at it with a
text: redhead, MONICA (17), sucking face like there's no tomorrow
text: against the door of her green Pontiac Firebird. Between
dialog: kisses, we can hear:
speaker_heading: ISAAC MONICA
dialog: Always. Always.
dialog: 
dialog: And Hazel hears:
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Literally.
text: Hazel turns to find the Beautiful Boy, Augustus, standing
text: right next to her.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I thought we were in a church
dialog: basement but apparently we were
dialog: literally in the heart of Jesus.
text: Hazel smiles.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Someone should probably tell him,
dialog: don't you think? Jesus? Seems kinda
dialog: dangerous keeping all these kids
dialog: with cancer in your heart.
text: Gus laughs.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: What's your name?
dialog: 13.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Hazel.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: No your full name?
speaker_heading: HAZEL
speaker_heading: (CONFUSED)
dialog: Hazel Grace Lancaster.
text: Gus nods to himself, smiles. Still fixated on her.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I didn't say anything.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Why are you looking at me like
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Because you're beautiful.
text: Hazel is taken aback. No one's ever said that to her before.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I enjoy looking at beautiful people
dialog: and I decided a while back not to
dialog: deny myself the simpler pleasures
dialog: of existence. Particularly given
dialog: that, as you so astutely pointed
dialog: out, we're all gonna die pretty
dialog: soon.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I'm not beaut --
text: A CUTE YOUNG GIRL walks past them.
speaker_heading: YOUNG GIRL
dialog: Hey Gus.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Hey Alisa.
dialog: Hazel isn't surprised that other girls know Gus. Of course
text: they do. She turns back towards Isaac and Monica pawing at
text: each other. She hears:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ISAAC MONICA
dialog: Always. Always.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: What's with the "always?"
dialog: 14.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: "Always" is their thing. They'll
dialog: "always" love each other and
dialog: whatnot. Must have texted "always"
dialog: to each other at least four million
dialog: times this year.
text: They continue to watch the show. It's pretty gross. Isaac
text: squeezes Monica's breast like a clown horn.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: He's gotta be hurting her boob.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Let's watch a movie.
text: Hazel is again surprised.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Oh. Um. Uh...
dialog: (yes!)
dialog: Sure. Yeah. I'm... pretty free this
speaker_heading: WEEK--
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: No I mean now.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Hmm?
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: What do you mean "now?"
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I've got a car.
text: He shrugs. Hazel has never seen someone so confident.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: You could be an axe murderer.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: There is that possibility.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Come on Hazel Grace... take a risk.
text: As Hazel mulls this over, Gus reaches into his pocket and
text: pulls out, of all things, a pack of cigarettes! Hazel is in
text: disbelief. He flips the box open, puts a cigarette between
text: his lips.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Oh my god. Oh. My. God. You're
dialog: kidding right?
dialog: (off his look)
dialog: You just ruined the whole thing!
dialog: 15.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Whole thing?
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: What, you think that's cool? Oh you
dialog: idiot! There's always a hamartia,
dialog: isn't there? And yours is - even
dialog: though you had FREAKING CANCER you
dialog: give money to a corporation for the
speaker_heading: chance to acquire EVEN MORE
dialog: CANCER!? Ugh. And you were doing so
dialog: well.
text: As she rants, Gus continues to look at her with that smile on
text: his face. Hazel does not find it so amusing.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Let me tell you... not being able
dialog: to breathe? Sucks. Totally sucks.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Hamartia?
text: Hazel folds her arms and turns away from him.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: A fatal flaw.
text: Gus takes a beat and then moves to face her, the smile still
text: etched on his face.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: They don't hurt you unless you
dialog: light them.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Sorry?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I've never lit one.
text: Hazel turns back to him.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: It's a metaphor. See? You put the
dialog: thing that kills you between your
dialog: teeth. But you don't give it the
dialog: power to do the killing.
text: Hazel is floored. And impressed.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Metaphor.
text: Gus holds her gaze. And it's at this point Frannie pulls up.
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: Hi sweetheart. Ready for some
dialog: "Model?"
dialog: 16.
dialog: 
text: Hazel looks at Gus, cigarette dangling from his lips. Cool as
text: anything. Handsome as hell. She looks back at her mom.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Can't tonight.
dialog: (off her confused look)
dialog: I've made plans with Augustus
dialog: Waters.
text: And with that, she walks off. Frannie looks at the boy with
text: the cigarette in his mouth. This could be trouble. Or
text: awesome. Or both. And we CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT GUS'S CAR - LATER
text: Hazel is terrified. Turns out, Gus is the world's worst
text: driver. When he brakes, her body flies forward against the
text: seatbelt. And when he hits the gas, seconds later, her neck
text: snaps back in the seat. Gus sees the look on her face.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I failed the test a couple times.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: You don't say.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Most amputees can drive with no
dialog: problem but... yeah. Not me.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I'm surprised you have a license.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Tell me about it!
text: Another brake forces Hazel against the seat belt.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: The fourth time I took the test...
dialog: it was going about how this is
dialog: going... and when it was over, the
text: instructor looks at me and goes,
dialog: "your driving, while unpleasant...
dialog: is not technically unsafe."
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Aha. Cancer perk.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Total cancer perk.
text: A few beats of silence.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: So what happened to you?
text: Hazel takes a deep breath. She's told this story before but
text: somehow this seems different.
dialog: 17.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I was 13 when they found it.
text: And as she speaks, we see it unfold. SMASH CUT TO:

speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: Stage IV thyroid cancer.

dialog: This poor little girl is taking a beating. And it's just
dialog: getting started.
dialog: - Radiation treatment.
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: Then Radiation...
dialog: - Having her head shaved by Frannie.
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: Then Chemo...
text: - With a PICC line in a chemo chair.
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: All of which worked for a while.
text: - A RADIOLOGIST looks at an X-ray. He's not pleased.
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: And then stopped working.
text: - 14-Year Old Hazel lies in bed, struggling to breathe.
text: Frannie runs her fingers through her hair. Dad calls 9-1-1.
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: And then my lungs started filling
text: up with water.
text: - In the ICU, her parents standing over her.
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: That should have been the end.
dialog: 18.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: (through the tears)
dialog: Are you ready, sweetie?
text: 14-Year Old Hazel nods. Michael can't keep it together any
text: longer. He completely breaks down.
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: But it wasn't.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT ICU - THE NEXT MORNING
text: The sun shines in the room. 14-year old Hazel eats ice chips,
text: the color has returned to her cheeks.
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: The antibiotics kicked in. They
dialog: drained the fluid from my lungs.
dialog: And in time I got better. Stronger.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT YET ANOTHER HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
text: Slightly older Hazel is getting more intravenous medication.
text: It's never ending.
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: I even found myself in an
dialog: experimental trial. You know the
dialog: ones that are famous in the
dialog: Republic of Cancervania for not
dialog: working.
text: - A SECOND RADIOLOGIST examines a second X-ray.
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: It's called Phalanxifor. Didn't
dialog: work in over 70 percent of patients
dialog: but, for some reason...
text: The Radiologist looks surprised.
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: ...it worked in me. They called it
dialog: "The Miracle."
dialog: And finally, BACK TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT GUS'S CAR - SAME
text: Gus has one eye on the road, the other on Hazel. He was
text: impressed with her before. He's totally dazzled now.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Tumors shrank, my mets have hardly
dialog: grown since...
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: HAZEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Of course my lungs still suck but,
dialog: theoretically, they could continue
dialog: to suck in just this way for, I
dialog: dunno, a while maybe.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Wow.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: So are you back in school or...?
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Can't.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Got my GED.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: A college girl! Well that explains
dialog: the aura of sophistication...
text: He smiles at her. She smiles back. Shoves his upper arm
text: playfully. They're easing into each other.
text: Eventually Gus's car pulls into his driveway.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: We're here.
text: He's as good at parking as he is at driving. CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT/INT GUS'S HOUSE - SAME
text: Hazel follows Gus inside. She quickly notices all sorts of
text: engraved plaques and framed signs with phrases like "Home is
dialog: Where the Heart Is" and "True Love is Born from Hard Times."
text: Hazel looks at Gus quizzically.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: My parents call them
dialog: "encouragements."
dialog: (rolling his eyes)
dialog: Don't ask.
text: Gus's MOM and DAD (40s) are in the kitchen making dinner.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Hey guys.
speaker_heading: GUS'S MOM
dialog: Augustus, hi. New friend?
dialog: 20.
dialog: 
text: Gus's parents don't seem surprised to see Gus with some
text: random girl in their house. Hazel takes note of that.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: This is Hazel Grace.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: It's just... Hazel.
speaker_heading: GUS'S DAD
dialog: How's it going, Just Hazel?
speaker_heading: GUS
speaker_heading: (ABRUPTLY)
dialog: Downstairs if you need us!
text: Gus drags Hazel to the next room. As she's pulled:
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Nice to meet you!
text: They walk down the carpeted stairs - Gus having an easier
text: time with his one leg than Hazel is with her oxygen tank and
text: weak lungs.
text: Eventually they arrive at Gus's basement bedroom. There's a
text: TV with a video game console, a few band posters, and a whole
dialog: host of basketball memorabilia (autographed sneakers, school
text: trophies, framed images etc.) Gus sees her looking at them.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I used to play.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Must have been pretty good.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: These are mine. And these. The rest
dialog: of it's just cancer perks.
text: Gus grabs a DVD from his stack of DVDs. Hazel sits down on
text: the bed, her breathing noticeably heavier.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Need to sit.
text: Gus sits down next to her on the bed.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Don't get any ideas.
dialog: (catching her breath)
dialog: All that standing... and stairs...
dialog: and then more standing... lotta
dialog: standing for me.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I understand.
dialog: 21.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I'll be fine in a minute. Unless I
dialog: faint. I'm a bit of a Victorian
text: lady, fainting-wise.
text: Gus smiles. He waits for her breathing to slow down. In time:
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: You ok?
text: Hazel nods, smiles.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: So what's your story?
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I already told you my story. I was
speaker_heading: DIAGNOSED --
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Not your cancer story. Your story.
dialog: Interests, hobbies, passions, weird
dialog: fetishes...
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Um...
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Don't tell me you're one of those
dialog: people who becomes their disease.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: No. I'm just... I don't know... un-
dialog: extraordinary.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I reject that out of hand.
dialog: (beat, Hazel shrugs)
dialog: Think of something you love. First
text: thing that comes to mind.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: "An Imperial Affliction."
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Ok. What's that?
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: It's a novel. My favorite novel.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Does it have zombies?
speaker_heading: HAZEL
speaker_heading: (LAUGHING)
dialog: What? No.
speaker_heading: GUS
text: Stormtroopers.
dialog: 22.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Seriously?
speaker_heading: (HE SHRUGS)
dialog: It's not that kind of book.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Sounds horrible.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: It's not, it's... kind of my bible
dialog: actually.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Interesting. What's it about?
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Cancer.
dialog: (off his look)
dialog: But not in that way, trust me. The
dialog: guy who wrote it, Peter Van Houten,
dialog: he's... well, the only person I've
dialog: ever come across who seems to a)
dialog: understand what it's like to be
dialog: dying and b) not have died.
speaker_heading: GUS
speaker_heading: (INTRIGUED)
dialog: In that case... I am going to read
dialog: this horrible book with the boring
dialog: title that does not contain zombies
dialog: or stormtroopers. And in
dialog: exchange...
text: Gus pulls a book from his bookshelf.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: ... all I ask is that you read this
dialog: brilliant and haunting novelization
dialog: of my favorite video game.
text: Hazel looks at the slim, ridiculous novella. She laughs.
text: She's adorable when she laughs. She takes the book from him
text: and as she does, their hands get tangled together for a
text: brief, charged moment.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Your hands are cold.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Not so much cold as under-
dialog: oxygenated.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Ooh Hazel Grace...
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I love it when you talk medical to
dialog: me.
text: Hazel blushes. And off her completely smitten smile, CUT TO:
dialog: 23.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - ANOTHER NIGHT
text: Hazel sits in bed reading Gus's novella. Frannie stands in
text: the doorway, notices the new book.
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: That's different.
text: Hazel shrugs. Frannie looks intrigued.
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: Did he give it to you?
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: By "it" do you mean herpes?
text: Frannie rolls her eyes. Hazel's phone buzzes. She excitedly
text: checks it - only to be disappointed. Frannie notices.
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: I'm sure he'll call, don't worry.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I'm not worried. Please. It's not
dialog: like I'm waiting for him to call or
dialog: anything. I just... we hung out. No
dialog: big deal.
text: Frannie says nothing to that. Her silence says it all. Hazel
text: rolls her eyes. CUT TO:
scene_heading: QUICK SERIES OF SCENES:
text: Hazel continues "not to wait" for Gus's call. We see her:
text: - Brushing her teeth. And checking her phone.
text: - Watching TV. And checking her phone.
text: - Eating breakfast. And checking her phone.
text: - Looking out the window on a rainy day. Trying not to check
text: her phone. Willing herself to not check the goddamn phone.
dialog: And checking the phone.
dialog: Where is he?! Did he forget about her?
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT HAZEL'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Hazel at the dinner table with her parents. She's a little
text: sullen, barely touching her food.
text: Hazel's phone buzzes. She tries not to seem too eager to
text: check it, what with her parents watching and all. She subtly
text: looks down at her lap. And sure enough: a text from Gus! Her
text: eyes bug out. We see:
dialog: 24.
dialog: 
dialog: "Tell me my copy is missing the last ten pages or something."
text: Hazel smiles. Goes back to eating. Frannie and Michael share
text: a quick glance. A second later, there's a follow-up text.
dialog: "Tell me I have NOT reached the end of this book!"
text: Hazel smiles again.
dialog: And then a third text:
text: "A BOOK CAN"T END IN THE MIDDLE OF A SENTENCE?! WHAT IN GOD'S
text: NAME IS THIS MADNESS! AAAAHHHH!"
text: Hazel now laughs out loud. Michael clears his throat. Hazel
text: looks up.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Would you like to be excused?
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT HAZEL'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER
text: Hazel sits down on a patio chair and dials the phone. Gus
text: answers on the first ring.
speaker_heading: GUS (O.S.)
dialog: Hazel Grace.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Welcome to the sweet torture of
dialog: reading "An Imperial --"
text: At which point she hears a loud WAIL coming from the other
text: end of the phone.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: What the -- are you ok?
speaker_heading: GUS (O.S.)
dialog: Me? Yeah. I'm excellent.
text: INTERCUT between Hazel on the patio and:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT GUS'S BASEMENT BEDROOM - SAME
text: Isaac's head is buried in Gus's couch. He's wailing like a
text: banshee, having some kind of nervous breakdown.
speaker_heading: GUS
speaker_heading: (INTO PHONE)
dialog: I am, however, with Isaac.
text: Hazel hears more wailing. Has no idea what to make of it.
dialog: 25.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUS (O.S.)
speaker_heading: (TO ISAAC)
dialog: Dude! Hey! Does Support Group Hazel
dialog: make this better or worse?
text: Hazel genuinely has no idea what the hell is going on.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Isaac! Focus. On. Me.
text: Hazel waits a few beats for Gus to come back on. Finally:
speaker_heading: GUS (O.S.)
speaker_heading: (TO HAZEL)
dialog: How fast can you get here?
text: Hazel thinks about this. And on her face, CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT GUS'S BASEMENT - LATER
text: Hazel descends the steps. She hears an ungodly moan before
dialog: she sees anyone. What has she gotten herself into? Gus
text: appears at the base.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (calling to Isaac)
dialog: Isaac, Hazel from Support Group is
text: coming downstairs.
text: Gus waits for a response. None comes. He gestures for her to
text: follow him into the room. Before he does:
speaker_heading: GUS
text: A gentle reminder: Isaac is in the
text: midst of a psychotic episode.
speaker_heading: (HAZEL NODS)
dialog: You look nice, by the way.
text: Hazel blushes, follows Gus into the room to find Isaac
text: sitting upside down in a gaming chair. Tears are flowing down
text: his reddened cheeks. Empty soda cans and bags of junk food
text: lie around him.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: How ya doing Isaac?
text: Again, no response. Hazel looks to Gus for an explanation.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Seems Isaac and Monica are no
dialog: longer a going concern.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Oh I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Do you want to talk about it?
text: Isaac starts to sob again.
dialog: 26.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: He just wants to cry and play video
dialog: games.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Fair enough.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: It doesn't hurt to talk to him,
dialog: however. If you have any sage words
dialog: of feminine advice...
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I actually think his response is
dialog: appropriate.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: "Pain demands to be felt."
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: (lights up at that)
dialog: You're quoting my book!
text: Gus winks at her. At which point, Isaac lets out another
text: howl. Gus gestures for Hazel to sit. The two of them flank
text: Isaac. He finally speaks.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: She didn't want to do it after the
dialog: surgery. Said she couldn't handle
dialog: it. I'm about to lose my eyesight
dialog: and she can't handle it.
text: Hazel rubs his shoulder in sympathy.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: I kept saying "always" to her.
dialog: Always, always, always. And she
dialog: just kept talking over me and not
dialog: saying it back. It was like I was
dialog: already gone, you know? "Always"
dialog: was a promise! You can't break
dialog: promises.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Sometimes people don't understand
dialog: the promises they're making when
dialog: they make them.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Right, sure, but you keep the
dialog: promise anyway. That's what love
dialog: is. Love is keeping the promise
dialog: anyway.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: That could be an "encouragement."
text: It's silent for a beat. And then Isaac stands up, a funny
text: look on his face.
dialog: 27.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Isaac...?
text: Suddenly Isaac starts kicking his chair across the room.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Here we go...
text: The chair lands against the bed. Gus hands Isaac something
text: else to throw, a pillow. Isaac grabs the pillow and slams it
text: against the wall. He dives on it and beings pummeling the
text: pillow like a maniac.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: That's it! Punch that thing.
text: And so he does. As he continues to, Gus looks at Hazel,
text: cigarette dangling from his mouth.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I've been wanting to call you on a
dialog: nearly minutely basis but I have
dialog: been waiting until I could form a
dialog: coherent thought in re: "An
dialog: Imperial Affliction."
speaker_heading: (SHE SMILES)
dialog: I can't stop thinking about it.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I know, right?
speaker_heading: GUS
text: The only problem is the ending.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
text: It is rather abrupt.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: It's torture! I mean, I totally get
dialog: that she died or whatever - Anna.
dialog: But there is an unwritten contract
dialog: between author and reader and I
dialog: think ending your book in the
dialog: middle of a sentence kind of
dialog: violates that contract.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: But that's part of what I like
dialog: about it. It portrays death
dialog: truthfully. You die in the middle
dialog: of your life, in the middle of a
dialog: sentence. But I do - God, I do want
dialog: to know what happens to everyone
dialog: else.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Yeah like her Mom.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: The Dutch Tulip Man...
dialog: 28.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Sysiphus the Hamster...
text: Hazel beams. Gus totally gets the book. A bond between them.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Have you tried contacting this...
dialog: Peter Van Houten?
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I've written letters. He's never
dialog: responded. Apparently he moved to
dialog: Amsterdam, became a recluse. Hasn't
dialog: published anything. Doesn't do
dialog: interviews.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Sad.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Hang on.
dialog: (turns to Isaac)
dialog: Isaac!
text: Gus stands and takes the pillow out of Isaac's hand.
speaker_heading: GUS
text: Pillows don't break.
text: Gus hands Isaac one of his basketball TROPHIES.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: You need to break something.
text: Isaac looks at it, then back to Gus as if asking permission.
text: Gus nods. Isaac holds it over his head and SMASH! The trophy
text: breaks into a million pieces. Isaac almost smiles. Gus hands
dialog: him another.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Go to town, my friend.
text: And Isaac does. Smashing them one by one. Hazel looks at Gus.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I've been looking for a way to tell
dialog: my Dad that I kinda hate
dialog: basketball. Think maybe we've found
dialog: it.
text: Isaac grabs more of the TROPHIES, smashing them to pieces.
text: Gus and Hazel enjoy the spectacle. When there are none left
text: Isaac is panting, standing over the bronze carnage.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Feel better?
text: Isaac thinks about it. Shakes his head no. Gus puts his arm
text: around him but looks at Hazel.
dialog: 29.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: That's the thing about pain... it
dialog: demands to be felt.
text: Hazel smiles. And on her face, we CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT LANCASTER HOUSE - DINING ROOM - ANOTHER NIGHT
text: Where Hazel is having dinner with her parents.
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: Dr. Maria called today. The PET
text: Scan is set for the eighth.
text: Hazel nods. This could be a source of worry but she's not
text: going to think about that right now. She's upbeat. And she's
text: actually eating, which her parents can't help but notice.
text: Frannie and Michael look at one another, pleased.
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: I told you Support Group was a good
dialog: idea.
text: Hazel's phone buzzes. "Augustus." She looks to her parents.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: By all means.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT HAZEL'S BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER
text: Hazel lays on the grass in her backyard staring up at the
text: stars. She rings him back and as she does SPLITSCREEN w/
dialog: Hazel in the grass and:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT GUS'S BASEMENT BEDROOM - SAME
text: Gus (upside down) in bed, a laptop on his chest.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Hazel Grace.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Hello Augustus.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: So I read it again. And I just kept
dialog: feeling like... like it was a gift.
dialog: Like you'd given me something
dialog: important.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
speaker_heading: (TOUCHED)
dialog: You're welcome.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: On the other hand... we need
dialog: closure, don't we?
dialog: 30.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: What we need is a sequel.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Yes. We need to know what happens
text: to Anna's family after she dies.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: That's what I kept asking Van
dialog: Houten for in my letters.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: But he never wrote back.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: That's correct.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Because he's a recluse.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Yeee-up.
speaker_heading: GUS
text: Utterly unreachable.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Unfortunately so.
text: Gus clears his throat, smiles. Hazel waits.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: "Dear Mr. Waters... I am writing to
dialog: thank you for your electronic
dialog: correspondence received this 6th of
dialog: April.
text: Hazel sits up. Could it be...?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: "I am grateful to anyone who sets
dialog: aside the time to read my book..."
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Augustus!?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I found his assistant. I emailed
dialog: her. She must have forwarded it to
dialog: him.
dialog: (Hazel is stunned)
dialog: Shall I continue?
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Keep reading, keep reading!
dialog: 31.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: "I am particularly indebted to you,
dialog: sir, both for your kind words about
dialog: `An Imperial Affliction' and for
dialog: taking the time to tell me that the
dialog: book, and here I quote you
dialog: directly, `meant a great deal' to
dialog: you."
text: Hazel pays attention to every word.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: "To answer your question: No, I
dialog: have not written anything else, nor
dialog: will I. I do not feel that
dialog: continuing to share my thoughts
dialog: with readers would benefit either
dialog: them or me. However thank you again
dialog: for your generous email. Yours most
text: sincerely, Peter Van Houten.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: You're making this up?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Hazel Grace, could I, with my
dialog: meager intellectual capabilities,
dialog: make up a letter from the great
dialog: Peter Van Houten?
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Holy hell.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Indeed.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Can I... would you mind...
speaker_heading: GUS
speaker_heading: (SMILING)
dialog: Go check your in-box.
text: Hazel jumps up as fast as her lungs will allow. CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Hazel sits at her computer, Van Houten's assistant's email
text: address staring her in the face. The cursor blinks on a blank
text: page. And then Hazel starts writing...
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: "Dear Mr. Peter Van Houten, my name
dialog: is Hazel Grace Lancaster. My friend
dialog: Augustus Waters, who read your book
dialog: - at my recommendation - just
dialog: received an email from you at this
dialog: address. I hope you will not mind
dialog: that he shared that email with me."
dialog: 32.
dialog: 
text: While Hazel reads the letter, we see a SERIES OF SCENES
text: showing the next several days. They include:
text: - Hazel and Gus drinking coffees at a cafe. He's
text: enthusiastically telling a story and she's enjoying every
dialog: moment of it.
dialog: - Hazel helping Gus become a better driver. It's no use.
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: "I was wondering if you wouldn't
dialog: mind answering a few questions I
dialog: have about what happens after the
dialog: end of the book. Specifically, the
speaker_heading: FOLLOWING:"
text: - In his kitchen, laughing, trying to make omelettes.
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: "Does Anna's Mom marry the Dutch
dialog: Tulip Man; is the Dutch Tulip Man
dialog: up to something - or is he just
dialog: misunderstood? What happens to
dialog: Anna's friends?
text: - Watching TV. Their bodies almost touching. But not quite.
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: Lastly, I was hoping you could shed
text: some light on Sisyphus the Hamster.
dialog: These questions have haunted me for
dialog: years. And I don't know how long I
dialog: have left to get answers to them."
text: And finally, back in Hazel's bedroom. She finishes reading
dialog: this letter into the phone.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: "I know these are not important
dialog: literary questions and that your
dialog: book is full of important literary
dialog: questions, but I would just really
dialog: like to know."
text: INTERCUT w/ Gus bouncing a ball against the wall, listening.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: (reading it aloud to him)
dialog: "And of course, if ever you do
dialog: decide to write anything else, even
dialog: if you don't want to publish it,
dialog: I'd love to read it. Frankly, I'd
dialog: read your grocery lists. Yours with
dialog: great admiration, Hazel Grace
dialog: Lancaster. Age 16."
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Not bad.
dialog: 33.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: You think?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Bit pretentious. But then again,
dialog: Van Houten uses words like
dialog: "tendentious" and... "bacchanalia"
dialog: so I think he'll like it.
text: Hazel smiles, looks at a clock.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Is it really almost 1?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Guess so.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I gotta get to sleep.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Ok...
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Ok...
text: Neither one of them want to hang up the phone.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Ok...
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Ok...
text: They both laugh at this.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Perhaps "ok" will be our "always."
text: Hazel smiles.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Ok.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Ok.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Ok.
text: Gus hangs up. We stay with Hazel. Is it really possible this
dialog: Beautiful Boy likes her? She thinks about it. She's not
dialog: convinced. CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT HOSPITAL - RECOVERY ROOM - DAY
text: Isaac lies in bed, bandages covering his eyes, now officially
text: blind. A NURSE attends to him while Hazel sits by his side.
dialog: 34.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: She hasn't even visited. Fourteen
dialog: months we were together. What kind
dialog: of person...
speaker_heading: ISAAC'S NURSE
dialog: You'll get over her Isaac. Just
dialog: takes a little time. You'll see.
text: The Nurse exits the room.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Is she gone?
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Did she really just say "you'll
dialog: see?"
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: (shakes her head)
dialog: Qualities of a Good Nurse. Go.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Doesn't pun your disability.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
text: Gets blood on the first try.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: That is huge. I mean, seriously, is
dialog: this my freakin' arm or a
dialog: dartboard? Three - no condescending
dialog: voice.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: (lays it on thick)
dialog: "I'm gonna stab you with this
dialog: needle now, so there might be a
dialog: little ouchie."
text: They laugh and then lapse into silence for a moment.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: You doing alright, Isaac?
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: I don't know. To be honest, I think
dialog: a hell of a lot more about Monica
dialog: than my eye. Is that crazy? That's
dialog: crazy.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: It's a little crazy.
dialog: 35.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: But I believe in love, you know? I
dialog: don't believe that everybody gets
dialog: to keep their eyes or not get sick
dialog: or whatever, but everybody should
dialog: have true love. Don't you think?
text: Hazel thinks about it as Isaac presses the button on his pain
text: pump, self-administering morphine.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Gus was here earlier.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: (trying to be nonchalant)
dialog: Was he?
text: Isaac exhales as the pain pump starts to kick in.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Mmm... that's better.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: The pain?
dialog: (off his slow nod)
dialog: Good. Good, Isaac.
dialog: (Isaac closes his eyes)
dialog: What about Gus?
text: But Isaac is already asleep. Whatever he was going to say
text: about Gus is gone. Hazel nods, pats his hand. CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - MORNING
text: Hazel rolls out of bed, stumbles to her computer. She
text: casually checks her in-box and is shocked to discover - he's
dialog: written her back!
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Holy shit!
speaker_heading: (READING ALOUD)
dialog: "Dear Ms. Lancaster... I cannot
dialog: answer your questions, at least not
dialog: in writing, because to do so would
dialog: constitute a sequel, which you
dialog: might publish or otherwise share on
dialog: the internet. Not that I don't
dialog: trust you, but how could I trust
dialog: you, I barely know you."
text: Hazel's jaw hangs open as she reads the next part:
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: "Should ever you find yourself in
dialog: Amsterdam, do pay a visit at your
dialog: leisure. Yours most sincerely,
dialog: Peter Van Houten" Son of a - WHAT
dialog: IS THIS LIFE!!!
dialog: 36.
dialog: 
text: Frannie races in, clearly expecting a health problem.
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: What's wrong?!
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: (realizing she scared her)
dialog: Nothing. Sorry.
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
speaker_heading: (CONFUSED)
dialog: Nothing?
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Everything! Look!
text: Hazel shows Frannie the note. Frannie reads it.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Can we go to Amsterdam? Please?
text: Frannie thinks about how to respond for a beat.
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: Hazel, I... I love you and... you
dialog: know I'd do anything for you, but
dialog: we don't...
speaker_heading: (PAINED)
dialog: We don't have the money. The
dialog: expense of getting equipment over
dialog: there - love, it's just not
dialog: possible...
speaker_heading: HAZEL
speaker_heading: (DEFLATES)
dialog: No, yeah, of course.
text: Clearly Frannie feels awful. Which makes Hazel feel awful.
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: I mean, I could talk to your father
dialog: OR --
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Mom, no. Please. Don't do anything.
dialog: Forget I mentioned it.
text: A beat between them. Frannie walks out, sadly. Hazel sits on
text: the bed, totally bummed now for two reasons.
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: Guilt is definitely a side effect
dialog: of cancer.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT SUBURBAN STREET - LATER
text: Hazel and Gus walk together on the sidewalk.
dialog: 37.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Just use your wish.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I've used it already. Pre-
dialog: "Miracle."
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: What'd you do?
text: Hazel doesn't want to say. Gus realizes.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Not Disney.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I was 13...
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Tell me you did not go to Disney
dialog: World.
dialog: (Hazel looks away)
dialog: Hazel Grace! You did not use your
dialog: one dying Wish to go to Disney
dialog: World!
speaker_heading: HAZEL
speaker_heading: (FEEBLE)
dialog: And Epcot Center.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (hands in the air)
dialog: Oh my God!
speaker_heading: HAZEL
speaker_heading: (DEFENDING HERSELF)
dialog: We had fun on that trip.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: That is the saddest thing I've ever
dialog: heard!
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I met Goofy...
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Now I'm embarrassed.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Why are you embarrassed?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: How can I have a crush on a girl
dialog: with such cliche wishes?
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Wait, what?
text: The word "crush" has taken Hazel totally by surprise.
dialog: 38.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: What?
text: She looks at him. A beat. She quickly looks away, blushing.
text: Gus continues on about Disney but all Hazel can think about
text: is "CRUSH". She tries not to seem too excited. CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT PET SCAN ROOM - DAY
text: Hazel, in a hospital gown, is slowly fed through the machine.
text: A TECH explains that she should hold still, try and relax,
dialog: etc. But Hazel knows. She knows all about these procedures.
dialog: She's a pro. CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT HAZEL'S HOUSE - FRONT
text: Gus is waiting on the front stoop when Frannie's car pulls
text: up. They're home from the hospital.
text: He wears an Indiana Pacers JERSEY and carries a bouquet of
text: bright orange TULIPS.
text: Michael gets out of the passenger's seat to help Hazel out of
text: the car. Gus rises to assist them.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Is that a Rik Smits jersey?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: It is indeed.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Man, I loved that guy.
text: Hazel sees Gus, wasn't expecting him.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Gus?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Hi Hazel.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: How would you like to go on a
dialog: picnic?
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT HAZEL'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Gus is with Frannie and Michael downstairs.
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: Something to drink?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I'm great Mrs. Lancaster.
dialog: 39.
dialog: 
text: Meanwhile, upstairs, Hazel gets ready for the date. She's put
text: the orange flowers in a toothbrush holder and is putting on
text: LIP GLOSS. She can faintly hear the conversation downstairs.
text: ANGLE ON Gus sitting on the stairs. Michael next to him.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You're a survivor yourself?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (taps his leg)
dialog: Didn't cut this fella off for the
dialog: hell of it. Though it is an
dialog: excellent weight-loss strategy.
dialog: Legs are heavy!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: How's your health now?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: N-E-C for fourteen months.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: That's fantastic.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I'm very lucky.
text: ANGLE ON Hazel, checking herself out in the mirror. Seems to
text: like what she sees a lot more than before.
text: BACK ON Gus and Michael, downstairs:
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Son, you have to understand...
dialog: Hazel's still pretty sick. She will
dialog: be the rest of her life.
text: ANGLE on Hazel, who can hear all of this. She stops what
text: she's doing and listens.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: She'll want to keep up with you -
dialog: she's that kind of girl - but the
dialog: truth is, her lungs --
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: You ready Gus?
text: Hazel appears, silencing her Father mid-sentence. CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT PARK - LATER
text: Behind the Indianapolis Museum of Art is 152 Acres of Gardens
text: and Grounds. Hazel and Gus walk together.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Is this where you bring all your
dialog: romantic conquests?
dialog: 40.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Every last one.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Probably why I'm still a virgin.
text: Hazel laughs, elbows him.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: You're not a virgin.
dialog: (off his look)
dialog: Are you really?
text: Gus picks a STICK up from the dirt. Draws a BIG CIRCLE in it.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: See this? This circle is virgins...
text: Now Gus draws a much smaller circle inside that circle.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: And this... is 17 year old dudes
text: with one leg.
text: Hazel laughs. Point made. He grabs her hand, helps her walk
text: up a tiny hill. Once up there, Gus lays a blanket on the
text: ground. They sit, looking out over a rather odd SCULPTURE - a
text: set of GIANT WHITE BONES where children can jump and play.
speaker_heading: GUS
speaker_heading: (EXPLAINING)
dialog: "Funky Bones" by Joep Van Lieshout.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: He sounds Dutch.
speaker_heading: GUS
text: And he is. Much like Rik Smits. And
text: tulips.
text: Hazel raises an eyebrow at Gus. He's sure taking this
text: Amsterdam/Dutch thing pretty far. He removes some sandwiches
text: and orange juice out of a basket.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Sandwich?
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Let me guess --
speaker_heading: GUS
speaker_heading: (NODS)
dialog: Dutch cheese. And tomato.
dialog: (she takes one)
dialog: The tomatoes are Mexican. Sorry.
text: They eat for a second, their eyes watching the children play
text: on the bones.
dialog: 41.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: How cool is that? A skeleton being
dialog: used as a playground.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: You do love your symbols.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Speaking of which...
text: Gus stands up, takes a cigarette, puts it in his mouth. He
text: clears his throat.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: You're probably wondering why
dialog: you're sitting here eating a bad
text: cheese sandwich and drinking orange
text: juice with a guy in a Rik Smits
dialog: jersey.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: It has crossed my mind.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Hazel Grace, like so many before
dialog: you - and I say this with great
dialog: affection - you spent your Wish...
text: moronically.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I was thir--
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Hush! I'm in the midst of a grand
dialog: soliloquy here.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Sorry. Please, continue...
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: You were young. Impressionable. The
dialog: Grim Reaper staring you in the
dialog: face. And the fear of dying with
dialog: your one true Wish left ungranted
dialog: led you to rush into making one you
dialog: didn't really want, for how could
dialog: little Hazel Grace, having never
dialog: read "An Imperial Affliction" ever
dialog: know that her one TRUE wish was to
dialog: visit Mr. Peter Van Houten in his
dialog: Amsterdamian exile.
text: Hazel nods in agreement.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: If you were smart, you would have
dialog: saved your wish til the time in
dialog: your life when you really knew your
dialog: true self.
dialog: 42.
dialog: 
text: Gus stops talking. Hazel is confused.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: But I... didn't save it.
text: Gus smiles.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Good thing I saved mine.
text: Hazel cocks her head to one side. What is he talking about?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Got it in exchange for the leg.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: And I still have it.
text: She starts to realize.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Are you saying --
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I'm not gonna give you my Wish or
dialog: anything. But I too have an
dialog: interest in meeting Peter Van
dialog: Houten and it wouldn't make much
dialog: sense to meet him without the girl
dialog: who introduced me to his book, now
dialog: would it?
dialog: (Hazel's eyes widen)
dialog: I talked to the Genies and they're
dialog: in total agreement.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: We leave on May third.
text: Hazel is so excited that she grabs Gus and pulls him into a
text: hug. Their faces close, lips inches apart, and just when it
dialog: looks like something might happen --
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Wait a minute.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Are you only doing this so I'll
dialog: kiss you?
text: A beat. Gus blinks a few times.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Cause I'd totally kiss you either
dialog: way.
text: And kiss him she does. He's surprised. And when it's over,
text: they sit back, look at one another. A magic moment.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Seriously... why are you doing
dialog: this?
dialog: 43.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Because Hazel Grace... I found my
dialog: Wish.
dialog: And Hazel is beyond touched. We hear:
speaker_heading: FRANNIE (OVERLAP)
dialog: Are you out of your mind?
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT HAZEL'S UTILITY ROOM - DAY
text: Frannie folds laundry while Hazel pleads her case.
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: It's too much, Haze. We can't
dialog: accept something like that from a
dialog: virtual stranger.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: He's not a stranger.
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Don't be gross.
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: It's still "no," I'm afraid.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Can we at least ask Dr. Maria?
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT DOCTOR'S OFFICE - ANOTHER DAY
text: Where Hazel's oncologist DR. MARIA shakes her head.
speaker_heading: DR. MARIA
dialog: That's out of the question.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: You said the PET scan was
dialog: encouraging!
speaker_heading: DR. MARIA
dialog: The PET scan is encouraging. We
dialog: just don't know how long it'll stay
dialog: that way. What if you get sick in a
dialog: foreign country?
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: They have doctors in Amsterdam. And
dialog: cancer. Someone will know what to
dialog: do.
dialog: 44.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. MARIA
dialog: Be that as it may, without someone
dialog: familiar with your particular case,
dialog: I can't --
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: (turns to her Mom)
dialog: So you'll come too.
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: The Genies can hook it up. They're
dialog: loaded.
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: I --
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: You've never been to Amsterdam,
dialog: have you Mom?
dialog: And judging from her face, seems she'd kinda like to. Dr.
text: Maria looks at Frannie, shrugs - kid's got a point.
text: Hazel smiles. And on that smile, we SMASH CUT TO:
speaker_heading: BLACK.
dialog: Over which, we HEAR:
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: And then this happened.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
dialog: [Note: There's no sound in this sequence. Just images.]
text: Hazel wakes up screaming in the middle of the night, shaking
text: and holding her head.
text: Frannie and Michael burst in. Mom grabs her crying daughter,
text: frightened beyond belief, waves to Michael to call for help.
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: People talk about the courage of
dialog: cancer patients. And I do not deny
dialog: that courage...
text: He leaves the room to do so and Fran stays behind, rocking
dialog: with her daughter, promising her it'll all be ok. Whatever
text: nightmare this is, it's going to end. CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT FRANNIE'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER
text: Still silent. Michael drives, trying to keep it together.
text: Frannie's in the back with Hazel's head in her lap.
dialog: 45.
dialog: 
text: Hazel continues to scream in silence, whether from pain or
dialog: terror, we do not know.
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: I'd been poked and stabbed and
dialog: poisoned for years and still I trod
dialog: on.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT EMERGENCY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Michael carries Hazel into the chaotic emergency room.
text: They're practically running. There's still no sound.
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: But make no mistake...
text: The doctors rally to assist the screaming, crying child.
text: She's wheeled away from her family who can only watch. We
dialog: stay with her and WE HEAR:
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: In that moment I would have been
text: very, very happy to die.
scene_heading: END SEQUENCE.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT HOSPITAL ROOM - ICU - MORNING
text: The sound returns. And it's the sound of a heart monitor.
text: BEEP. BEEP. BEEP. It's also the sound of a working heart.
text: Hazel has made it through. Her eyes open. A NURSE is there.
speaker_heading: HAZEL'S NURSE
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: HAZEL'S NURSE
dialog: You're ok, Hazel.
text: Even Hazel seems surprised by that.
speaker_heading: HAZEL'S NURSE
dialog: Would you like to see your parents?
text: Hazel nods. The Nurse goes to get them. Soon they come
text: bounding in, crying and kissing her repeatedly. So much
dialog: relief. CUT TO:
text: LATER. Hazel's bed has been raised up so she can talk to her
dialog: parents "comfortably."
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: They thought it was a brain tumor.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: It wasn't - thank god --
dialog: 46.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: So what happened?
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
text: The usual. Fluid in the lungs,
dialog: preventing oxygenation. They put
dialog: that in...
text: There's a TUBE in Hazel's side draining fluid into a plastic
text: bladder that hangs off her bed.
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: Drained a liter and a half last
dialog: night.
dialog: (That's a lot of fluid.)
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: The good news is... no tumor
dialog: growth. No new tumors in your body.
text: Hazel nods. That is a relief.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: We're all so relieved.
text: Frannie embraces her daughter.
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: This is just a thing Hazel. It's a
dialog: thing we can live with.
text: Hazel nods again. Only in the universe of Hazel Grace
dialog: Lancaster is something like this just a thing. Meanwhile:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT HOSPITAL ICU - WAITING AREA - LATER
text: Here's Gus, his foot tapping nervously on the floor. It's
text: unclear how long he's been waiting there. He sees Michael
text: walk down the hall. Races after him.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Mr. Lancaster! How's she doing?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Better, thank you. Much better.
text: Gus nods, as relieved as the rest of them.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: They won't let me in. Family only.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I'm sorry --
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: No I get it. Will you just... will
dialog: you tell her I was here?
dialog: 47.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Of course I will.
text: Gus smiles. And sits back down. Though he won't get to see
dialog: her, he still wants to stay.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Gus.
dialog: Michael really likes this kid.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Why don't you go home, get some
dialog: rest?
text: Gus looks up. That might be for the best. CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT HOSPITAL - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAYS LATER
text: Hazel and her Parents sit at a very large conference table
text: along with Dr. Maria and THREE OTHER ONCOLOGISTS - her whole
dialog: "Cancer Team."
speaker_heading: ONCOLOGIST #1
dialog: The great news is... Phalanxifor
dialog: continues to control your tumor
dialog: growth.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: The not so great news is we're
dialog: still seeing serious problems with
dialog: fluid accumulation.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: So how should we proceed?
text: Silence. Hazel looks around the room, waits for someone to
text: answer. No one does.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Um, I feel like I'm not the most
dialog: qualified person to answer that.
speaker_heading: ONCOLOGIST #1
dialog: I was talking to Dr. Simmons.
text: DR. SIMMONS (late 60s, white beard, old school) speaks next.
speaker_heading: DR. SIMMONS
dialog: It's a strange case. Normally the
dialog: tumors start resisting the
dialog: treatment. But that hasn't happened
dialog: here - yet.
text: Hazel hears the "yet" the loudest.
speaker_heading: DR. SIMMONS
dialog: Unfortunately, the drug may be
dialog: worsening the edema.
dialog: 48.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. MARIA
dialog: But if we stopped it entirely,
dialog: we're likely to face even graver
dialog: dangers.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: So we're gonna do nothing?
speaker_heading: DR. MARIA
dialog: That's what we have to decide. The
dialog: truth is... very few people have
dialog: been on Phalanxifor as long as
dialog: Hazel has. We don't really know the
dialog: long term effects.
dialog: That comforts no one.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Can't I just get like a lung
dialog: transplant or something?
dialog: The Doctors look at one another like "who wants to take that
dialog: one?" Eventually:
speaker_heading: DR. MARIA
dialog: You would not be considered a...
dialog: strong candidate for a transplant.
text: Hazel takes that in, nods, tries to pretend it didn't bother
text: her. Sensitive Michael on the other hand starts to cry a
text: little bit. He grabs Frannie's hand.
speaker_heading: DR. SIMMONS
dialog: We're trying to prevent endothelial
dialog: growth while at the same time
dialog: preventing immunosorbent...
text: As Dr. Simmons drones on with some cancer gobbledygook,
text: Hazel's eyes remain firmly fixed on her parents. She hates
text: what she's doing to them. And seeing them holding hands,
text: crying but trying not to cry - it jogs a memory. CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT HOSPITAL ICU - FLASHBACK
dialog: We saw this once before. It looks like the end for 13-year
text: old Hazel. Her father is weeping off to the side while her
text: mom stands over her, holding her hand, and asking:
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: (through the tears)
dialog: Are you ready, sweetie?
text: 13-year old Hazel nods. The doctors get to work. The
text: anaesthetic takes hold and Hazel goes under. But not enough.
dialog: Cause she totally hears her mother say:
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: I won't be a mom anymore.
dialog: 49.
dialog: 
text: She falls into her husband's chest. And we're BACK TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT HOSPITAL - CONFERENCE ROOM
text: Hazel comes out of the memory when her parents see her
text: staring at them. She tries to shake it off. Dr. Simmons is
dialog: still talking nonsense when:
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I have a question.
speaker_heading: DR. MARIA
dialog: Yes Hazel.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Can I still go to Amsterdam?
text: Dr. Simmons can't help himself. He laughs. Everyone looks at
text: him. He clears his throat.
speaker_heading: DR. SIMMONS
dialog: That would not be wise at this
dialog: juncture.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: DR. SIMMONS
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Why not, Dr. Simmons?
speaker_heading: DR. SIMMONS
dialog: I --
dialog: The doctors are trying to be delicate here.
speaker_heading: DR. MARIA
dialog: It would... increase some risks --
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: So does going to the mall --
speaker_heading: DR. MARIA
dialog: Yes but an airplane?
speaker_heading: HAZEL
text: They have oxygen on airplanes.
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
speaker_heading: HAZEL --
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: It's my life, right?
speaker_heading: DR. SIMMONS
dialog: You're Stage IV --
dialog: 50.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I have this opportunity I may never
dialog: have again. If the medicine's
dialog: working, I don't see why --
speaker_heading: DR. SIMMONS
dialog: Because, Hazel.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Look, I don't know any other way to
dialog: say this... You're just too sick.
dialog: And this is like a punch in the gut.
speaker_heading: DR. SIMMONS
dialog: I'm sorry.
text: Everyone feels horrible now. Dr. Maria, Frannie and Michael,
dialog: and even Hazel. This meeting couldn't have gone worse. And we
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT HAZEL'S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY
text: Hazel parent's bring her home from the hospital. She looks
dialog: miserable. It's clear the last few days have been a big
text: emotional set back. CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - LATER
text: Her parents tuck her in.
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: We'll be right outside.
text: Hazel nods. Her phone buzzes. She looks at it. A text from
text: Gus that reads: "ok?" Hazel looks at it.
text: And she doesn't write back. CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT HAZEL'S KITCHEN - ANOTHER NIGHT
text: Hazel sits staring at nothing. The house phone rings. Michael
text: comes in from another room with the phone in hand. Whispers:
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Gus again.
text: Hazel thinks about it - silently shakes her head, no. Michael
text: says into the phone.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I'm sorry Gus, she's asleep.
text: Hazel stands and goes into her bedroom, clearly depressed.
dialog: 51.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - LATER
text: Hazel reads from "An Imperial Affliction." Her phone buzzes
text: again. "Augustus." It just says "hello?" Again she ignores
dialog: it.
text: And then a second text. She looks at it. "The silence is
text: deafening." She puts the phone back down.
text: Hazel's heart breaks. She can't take it anymore. She picks
text: the phone back up. She texts the following:
dialog: "I don't know if you'll understand this but I can't see you
dialog: anymore. I mean I want to. I just..."
text: She thinks about the rest. She writes:

text: She sends the text. Waits.
text: And then there's more to say. She sends a second text.
dialog: "When I look at you, all I can see is what I'm going to put
dialog: you through. I can't have that. I'm sorry."
text: She sends that text. Waits.
text: He writes back.
dialog: "Ok."
text: Hazel reads it. Writes back: "Ok."
text: A beat. Gus responds: "oh my god, stop flirting with me!"
text: Hazel smiles - she can't help herself! - but she must. She
text: gets her emotions in check. Puts the phone away. CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT HAZEL'S HOUSE - ESTABLISHING
text: An ugly day in Indianapolis.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT HAZEL'S HOUSE - SAME
text: Inside, Hazel is about as miserable as the weather. The sky -
text: and the circumstances - have cast a grey pall over the day.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT HAZEL'S HOUSE - BACKYARD
text: Hazel walks out back. Looks up at the clouds, threatening
text: rain but not yet delivering it. She sits down in the grass,
text: on the verge of tears. She looks at the old rusty SWING SET
dialog: that's been in her backyard for years.
dialog: 52.
dialog: 
text: And starts to cry. Just for a few brief moments, she lets
dialog: herself cry.
text: Then she wipes the tears. Becomes strong again. And makes a
dialog: decision.
text: Hazel dials her phone. We hear:
speaker_heading: GUS (O.S.)
dialog: Hazel Grace!
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Hi Augustus.
speaker_heading: GUS (O.S.)
dialog: Are you crying, Hazel Grace?
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Kind of.
speaker_heading: GUS (O.S.)
dialog: What's the matter?
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I don't know. I want to go to
dialog: Amsterdam. And I want him to tell
dialog: us what happens after the book and
dialog: I don't want my particular life and
dialog: also the sky is making me sad and
dialog: there's this old swing set that my
dialog: Dad made for me when I was a kid.
dialog: It's just... everything.
text: Hazel is on the verge of losing it again. A few beats of
text: silence pass by.
speaker_heading: GUS (O.S.)
dialog: I demand to see this swing set of
dialog: tears.
text: Hazel can't help but smile and we CUT TO:
text: LATER. Same backyard - only now Hazel is with Gus. Which
dialog: makes everything better.
text: They both look at the swing set.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I see your point.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: That is one sad swing set.
text: Hazel nudges her head onto his shoulder.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Thanks for coming over.
dialog: 53.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: You do realize... trying to keep
dialog: your distance from me will in no
dialog: way lessen my affection for you.
text: Hazel says nothing.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: All efforts to save me from you
dialog: will fail.
text: Hazel looks at him. He's sure not making this easy.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Is this about Amsterdam? Cause we
speaker_heading: DON'T --
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: It's not about Amsterdam. It's
dialog: about me. It's about...
speaker_heading: GUS
text: Grenades.
text: Hazel nods.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I get it. One day you're going to
text: explode in a huge ball of fire and
dialog: everyone close to you will die in
dialog: your wake.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Exactly.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: There's already two people in your
dialog: life you're going to destroy. Why
dialog: add a third to that list. Am I
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: HAZEL
speaker_heading: (NODS)
dialog: That's why I don't have a hamster.
text: Gus is silent. He can't argue. They stand there quietly a few
text: more beats, looking out at the swing set. Until:
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: We have got to do something about
text: this frigging swing set.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Hazel sits at the computer screen writing a Craigslist post.
text: Gus stands next to her.
dialog: 54.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAZEL
speaker_heading: (TYPING)
dialog: "Swing Set Needs Home."
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: "Desperately Lonely Swing Set Needs
dialog: Loving Home."
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: "Lonely, Vaguely Pedophilic Swing
dialog: Set Seeks Butts of Children."
text: Gus laughs.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: No?
text: Gus laughs harder. Hazel laughs with him.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: That's why.
text: Hazel looks at him, not understanding.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: In case you were wondering...
dialog: that's why I like you.
dialog: (beat, off her look)
dialog: You're so busy being you that you
dialog: have no idea how utterly
dialog: unprecedented you are.
text: Hazel absorbs that. Her feelings for this boy in a tangle.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT HAZEL'S HOUSE - BACKYARD
text: Gus and Hazel watch as a TOWNIE finishes loading the swing
text: set into the back of his PICK-UP. Gus salutes the swing set
text: as the truck drives off.
text: Then he sneaks a quick kiss on Hazel's cheek. She shoots him
text: a look. Gus throws up his hands.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Friendly.
text: She playfully elbows him away.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT CHURCH - ANOTHER DAY
text: Hazel walks with Isaac out of Support Group.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Do you like him?
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Of course I like him.
dialog: 55.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: But you don't want to hook up with
dialog: him?
text: Hazel doesn't know what she wants.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: It's complicated.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - DAY
text: Hazel is at her computer reading a new email from Lidewij
text: Vliegenthart. Clearly Hazel was not expecting this.
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: "Dear Hazel, I have received word
dialog: via the Genies that you will be
dialog: visiting us with Augustus Waters
dialog: and your mother beginning on the
dialog: 4th. A week away! Peter and I are
dialog: delighted and cannot wait to --
text: Hazel is confused. She stands and walks into the hallway.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Mom?
dialog: No response.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Mom!
speaker_heading: (STILL NOTHING)
dialog: MOM!!!
text: Frannie races out of her room in a towel, dripping wet.
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: What is it, what's wrong?!
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Sorry, I... I didn't know you were
text: in the shower.
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
speaker_heading: (EXHAUSTED)
dialog: Bath. I was just... just trying to
dialog: take a bath for five seconds.
dialog: What's the matter?
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Did you ever call the Genies to
dialog: tell them the trip is off? I just
dialog: got an email from Peter Van
text: Houton's assistant. She still
dialog: thinks we're coming.
text: Frannie purses her lips and squints past Hazel. Clearly
dialog: unsure what to say.
dialog: 56.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: What?
text: Frannie can't keep a straight face.
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: I'm not supposed to tell you until
dialog: your father gets home.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: We're going to Amsterdam.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: (still not believing)
dialog: Really...
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: Dr. Maria called last night and
dialog: made a convincing case that you
dialog: need to live --
speaker_heading: HAZEL
speaker_heading: (YELLING)
dialog: I LOVE YOU SO MUCH!!
text: Hazel can't move all that fast to hug her Mom so Frannie
text: comes to her and they embrace. After:
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: I'm getting back in the tub now.
text: When she leaves Hazel grabs her cell phone. ANGLE ON IT.
text: Hazel sends Gus the following text: "STILL FREE MAY 3? :-)"
text: A moment later Gus responds: "EVERYTHING'S COMING UP WATERS!"
text: Hazel is over the moon with excitement. She smiles, then
text: tries to calm herself, knowing it's the best thing.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: (whispering to her lungs)
dialog: One week, lungs. Keep your shit
dialog: together one more week...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT KITCHEN - ONE WEEK LATER
text: Luggage waits by the door, including oxygen tanks and medical
text: equipment. Frannie makes breakfast as Hazel enters, now
text: dressed and excited for the trip.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Amsterdam!
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: Amsterdam!
text: And a moment later Michael joins them.
dialog: 57.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Amsterdam!
text: They're all going crazy with excitement! CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT HOUSE - LATER
text: Michael finishes loading up the car. Kisses his wife goodbye.
text: He embraces Hazel. She hugs him back and of course he starts
dialog: to cry.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
speaker_heading: (WHISPERING)
dialog: I love you. I'm so proud of you.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: For what?
text: Michael lets go of her and wipes away his tears. They look at
text: each other. Unable to help himself, he grabs her for another
text: hug. Hazel lets him, laughing.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT / EXT CAR - LATER
text: The car is packed with oxygen tanks, a suitcase for clothes,
dialog: another for medicines and back-up medicines just in case etc.
text: Frannie pulls up to Gus's house. They get out of the car and
text: head to the front door, buzzing with excitement.
text: As they get close, they can hear a commotion inside. A
text: WOMAN'S VOICE yelling something unclear, followed by:
speaker_heading: GUS (O.S.)
scene_heading: BECAUSE IT'S MY LIFE, MOM. IT
dialog: BELONGS TO ME!
text: Frannie immediately puts her arm around Hazel and quickly
text: spins her back to the car.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Mom?
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: We can't eavesdrop, Hazel.
text: Back at the car, far out of earshot, they wait. Hazel unsure
text: what that was about. Frannie politely honks the horn.
text: A moment later Gus emerges from the house, smiling. A travel
text: bag over his shoulder and a cigarette dangling from his lips.
speaker_heading: GUS
speaker_heading: (TO FRANNIE)
dialog: Always a pleasure to see you ma'am.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Hello, Hazel Grace.
dialog: 58.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Ok...?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Ok.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Ok.
text: Frannie doesn't know what to make of any of that. She just
text: says, when they stop and look at her:
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: Amsterdam!
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT AIRPORT - ESTABLISHING
text: A SKYCAP helps Hazel, Gus and Frannie with all their bags and
dialog: equipment.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT AIRPORT - MOMENTS LATER
text: They wait in line for the security checkpoint. When it's
text: Hazel's turn she unhooks the plastic nubbins from her nose.
text: Gus places the oxygen tank on the conveyer belt.
text: Hazel takes slow, careful steps through the metal detector.
text: She seems determined to get through this without any help.
dialog: But upon reaching the other side it's clear that even these
text: few steps without oxygen were a struggle.
text: Hazel holds on to the side of the conveyer belt to steady
text: herself. As soon as her tank reappears she puts the cannula
text: back in place. Still light-headed, Hazel closes her eyes and
text: focuses on her breathing. She catches her mom looking at her,
dialog: nervously.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: (with some difficulty)
dialog: Amsterdam!
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT AIRPORT GATE - LATER
text: Arriving at the Gate area they draw curious looks from the
text: OTHER PASSENGERS: Hazel with her oxygen tank, Gus with his
text: noticeable limp and Frannie helping with the equipment.
text: A YOUNG COUPLE gets up so that Hazel and Gus can sit.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Oh that's not necessary.
text: But they give up their seats anyway. Hazel and Gus take them.
text: We see various Passengers watching. Hazel ignores the
text: attention until a LITTLE GIRL (6, cute braids) appears.
dialog: 59.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LITTLE GIRL
dialog: What's in your nose?
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: It's called a Cannula. These tubes
dialog: give me oxygen and help me breathe.
text: The GIRL'S MOTHER swoops in, a little frantic.
speaker_heading: GIRL'S MOTHER
dialog: Jackie... Oh, I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
speaker_heading: (SINCERE)
dialog: No, no. It's alright.
speaker_heading: LITTLE GIRL
dialog: Would they help me breathe too?
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I dunno. Wanna try?
text: Hazel removes her cannula and let's the Little Girl try it.
speaker_heading: LITTLE GIRL
text: Tickles.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Right?
speaker_heading: LITTLE GIRL
dialog: I think I'm breathing better.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Well... I'd love to give you my
dialog: cannula but... I kinda really need
dialog: the help.
text: The Little Girl nods, hands it back to Hazel, who quickly
text: reattaches it.
speaker_heading: LITTLE GIRL
dialog: Thanks for letting me try it.
text: They smile at each other before the Little Girl walks back to
text: her family. She waves. Hazel waves back.
speaker_heading: AIRPORT ANNOUNCEMENT (O.S.)
dialog: We will now begin pre-boarding
dialog: Flight 144 to Amsterdam. For those
dialog: passengers in need of extra
dialog: assistance...
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I think that's us.
dialog: 60.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT AIRPLANE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Hazel sits in the middle with Frannie on the aisle and Gus at
text: the window. He looks around, antsy.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Have you never been on a plane
dialog: before?
text: Gus shakes his head, he has not. And he's nervous. He pulls a
text: cigarette out of his pocket and puts it in his mouth. Within
text: seconds a FLIGHT ATTENDANT rushes over.
scene_heading: FLIGHT ATTENDANT
dialog: Sir, you can't smoke on this plane.
dialog: Or... any plane.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (cigarette in his mouth)
dialog: I don't smoke.
text: The Flight Attendant shoots him a look.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: It's a metaphor. He puts the
text: killing thing in his mouth but
dialog: doesn't give it the power to kill
dialog: him.
scene_heading: FLIGHT ATTENDANT
speaker_heading: (NO NONSENSE)
dialog: That metaphor is prohibited on
dialog: today's flight.
text: Gus nods and puts the cigarette away.
speaker_heading: PA SYSTEM
dialog: "Flight attendants, prepare for
dialog: departure."
text: The engines roar to life and the plane accelerates towards
text: take off. Gus is getting more worried by the second. He grabs
text: the arm rest, his eyes wide.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Ok?
text: Gus doesn't say it back. Hazel laughs.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: This is what it feels like to ride
dialog: in a car with you.
text: Gus grabs Hazel's hand as the plane lifts off. He looks out
text: the window - they're flying! - and then back to Hazel.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: We're flying! Look!
text: Hazel smiles at his enthusiasm.
dialog: 61.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Holy -- look at that?! NOTHING HAS
text: EVER LOOKED LIKE THAT EVER IN ALL
text: OF HUMAN HISTORY!
text: He's adorable at this moment. Hazel can't resist leaning over
text: to give him a kiss on the cheek.
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
text: (not looking up from her
speaker_heading: MAGAZINE)
dialog: Just so you know, I'm right here.
dialog: Sitting next to you. Your mother.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: We're just friends, Mom.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: She is. I'm not.
text: Hazel shoots him a look. Gus shrugs - "what, it's the truth."
text: Hazel just shakes her head. CUT TO:
text: LATER. Mid-flight, the plane is dark, Frannie's asleep. Hazel
text: and Gus watch the same gory action movie. Actually, he
text: watches the movie. She just watches him watch it. He watches
text: it with gusto.
text: Hazel continues to watch him. Try as she might, she's falling
dialog: in love. CUT TO:
text: SFX: the PLANE touching down. CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT/ INT AMSTERDAM HIGHWAY - TAXI CAB - MORNING
text: Hazel, Gus, and Frannie ride in the back of a YELLOW CAB.
speaker_heading: CAB DRIVER
dialog: Americans?
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: We're from Indiana.
speaker_heading: CAB DRIVER
dialog: Indiana. They steal from the
dialog: Indians but the keep the name, yes?
text: Hazel and Gus share a look.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Something like that.
text: Meanwhile, the landscape outside is flat and dusty, with dirt
text: tracks and the occasional concrete building. In other words,
text: it looks more like Indianapolis than Holland.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: (to the Driver)
dialog: This is Amsterdam?
dialog: 62.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAB DRIVER
dialog: Yes and no. Amsterdam is like the
text: rings of a tree. It gets older as
dialog: you get closer to the center.
text: Soon enough, the cab takes an off-ramp and turns a corner and
text: suddenly, it's as if they're transported - not only to
dialog: another universe but to another time as well.
text: We see MULTI-COLORED ROW HOUSES lined on both sides of a
text: windy CANAL. HOUSEBOATS float against the edges and everyone
text: rides BICYCLES down cobblestone streets. They're astounded.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT HOTEL - LATER
text: Gus helps Hazel and Frannie bring their stuff into the room.
text: We see a WICKER BASKET of gifts - presents from the Genies -
text: welcoming their arrival. Hazel, exhausted, sits on the bed.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I'll be right down the hall.
text: Hazel nods, already drifting off to sleep. CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT HOTEL ROOM - HOURS LATER
text: Some time later. Hazel stirs. Her Mom is seated in a sagging,
text: paisley CHAIR across from the bed reading a TRAVEL GUIDE.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Good morning.
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
text: Actually, it's five o'clock.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: How was the park?
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: Never made it.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Mom!
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: What? I like watching you sleep.
text: Hazel shoots Frannie a look. Even in an exotic city, her Mom
dialog: still can't enjoy herself.
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: I promise I'll do crazy Mom stuff
dialog: tonight while you and Gus are at
dialog: dinner.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: What do you mean?
dialog: 63.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: You have reservations at a place
dialog: called Oranjee. Mr. Van Houten set
dialog: it up. Very fancy according to the
dialog: Book. And romantic.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Mom...
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: I'm just saying...
speaker_heading: HAZEL
text: A 16 year old girl running free
text: with an older boy on the streets of
dialog: a foreign city famous for its vice
dialog: and debauchery... is totally cool
dialog: with you. Is that what you're
dialog: saying?
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: (beat, excited)
dialog: Let's get you dressed!
text: Hazel just shakes her head. CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT HOTEL ROOM - LATER
text: Frannie opens the door to find Gus in a perfectly tailored
text: BLACK SUIT, cigarette dangling from his mouth.
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: (calling to the bathroom)
dialog: Hazel! Gus is here.
speaker_heading: (TO GUS)
text: Looking sharp.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Thank you ma'am.
text: A few beats later Hazel emerges from the bathroom. She wears
text: a knee-length, pale blue SUNDRESS. And she looks...
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Wow.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I...
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Am I under-dressed?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: You look gorgeous.
text: Gus offers Hazel his arm. She takes it. They're ready to go.
dialog: 64.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT/EXT AMSTERDAM - ON THE TRAM - LATER
text: Hazel and Gus ride the crowded tram through the city. ELM
text: TREES line the canals, their pale petals blowing into the
text: wind like a spring snowstorm.
text: An OLD COUPLE stands to give up their seats - this happens
text: all the time. Hazel again tries to protest and again it falls
text: on deaf ears. She and Gus sit. They look out the window onto
text: the city. Excited. The night just beginning.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT ORANJEE RESTAURANT - LATER
text: At the edge of the canal, near an ancient bridge. Hazel and
text: Gus are shown to a TABLE right next to the water.
speaker_heading: HOSTESS
dialog: Your table, Mr. And Mrs. Waters.
text: Gus pulls out Hazel's chair for her. A WAITER brings them a
text: bottle of CHAMPAGNE as they sit.
speaker_heading: HOSTESS
dialog: The champagne is our gift.
text: Hazel and Gus look at each other. Is this a dream? The
text: champagne is poured and Gus raises his glass.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Ok.
text: Hazel raises hers.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Ok.
text: They clink glasses and sip.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Wow that's good.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Do you know what Dom Perignon said
dialog: after he invented champagne?
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: `Come quickly,' he said. `I am
dialog: tasting the stars!'
text: Hazel and Gus smile.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Welcome to Oranjee. Would you like
dialog: a menu or will you have the chef's
dialog: choice?
text: Gus looks at Hazel. She shrugs.
dialog: 65.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: The chef's choice sounds lovely.
dialog: (the Waiter nods)
dialog: And can we get more of this?
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: We have bottled all the stars for
dialog: you this evening, my young friends.
text: The Waiter leaves. Hazel and Gus look at each other.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Thank you for coming to Amsterdam.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Thank you for letting me hijack
dialog: your wish.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Thank you for wearing that dress
dialog: which is like whoa.
text: Hazel shakes her head, trying not to smile but unable not to.
text: The Waiter brings two more glasses of champagne and a plate:
speaker_heading: WAITER
text: Belgian white asparagus with a
text: lavender infusion.
text: Hazel takes a bite.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Oh my god.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Yeah?
text: Gus takes a bite.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I mean...
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: That is just...
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: There are no words.
text: Meanwhile, down on the water a BOAT passes, filled with
text: merry, drinking LOCALS. One of them raises a glass to them
text: and says something in Dutch.
speaker_heading: GUS
speaker_heading: (SHOUTING BACK)
dialog: We don't speak Dutch!
speaker_heading: ANOTHER LOCAL
dialog: She says, "the beautiful couple is
dialog: beautiful!"
dialog: 66.
dialog: 
text: Hazel and Gus smile. This night could not be going any better
dialog: so far. CUT TO:
text: LATER. Hazel and Gus enjoying their second courses.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I want this dragon carrot risotto
dialog: to become a person so I can take it
dialog: to Vegas and marry it.
text: Hazel leans back in her chair, in need of a breather.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I like your suit.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Thanks. First time wearing it.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: That isn't the suit you wear to
dialog: funerals?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Oh no. That one's not nearly this
dialog: nice.
dialog: (off her look)
dialog: When I first found out I was sick -
dialog: I mean, they told me I had like an
dialog: 85% chance to be cancer-free. Great
dialog: odds, sure. But that meant a year
dialog: of torture, the loss of my leg, and
dialog: still a 15% chance it might fail.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: So right before the surgery I asked
dialog: my parents if I could buy a suit,
dialog: like a really nice suit, just in
dialog: case I didn't make it.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: It's your death suit.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: That's what it is.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I have one of those. Bought it for
dialog: my 15th birthday. Don't think I'd
dialog: wear it on a date, though.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Are we on a date?
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: (cocks her head)
dialog: Watch it.
text: Gus winks. CUT TO:
text: LATER. Dessert on the table. As they euphorically eat:
dialog: 67.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: God?
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Maybe.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Angels?
speaker_heading: HAZEL
text: Undecided.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Afterlife?
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: No. Well...
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Maybe I wouldn't go so far as to
dialog: say no. I just... I'd like some
dialog: evidence.
speaker_heading: (GUS NODS)
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Absolutely.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Oh for sure. I mean, not like a
dialog: heaven where you ride unicorns,
text: play harps, and live in a mansion
dialog: made of clouds but, yeah, I believe
dialog: in something.
text: Hazel is surprised.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Something becomes of us. It has to.
dialog: Otherwise what's the point?
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Maybe there is no point.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I refuse to accept that.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I won't accept it.
text: Hazel thinks about it. She appreciates his conviction but is
text: still not sure she agrees. The hand they've been dealt too
text: unfair. Hazel looks out at the water as she says:
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I hope you're right.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I'm in love with you.
dialog: 68.
dialog: 
text: That gets her attention.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: You heard me.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
speaker_heading: AUGUSTUS --
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I'm in love with you. And I know
dialog: that love is just a shout into the
dialog: void, and that oblivion is
dialog: inevitable, and that we're all
dialog: doomed and that there will come a
dialog: day when all our labor has been
dialog: returned to dust, and I know the
dialog: sun will swallow the only earth
dialog: we'll ever have, and I am in love
dialog: with you.
dialog: (shrugs, matter-of-fact)
dialog: Sorry.
text: At which point, the Waiter reappears.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: More stars?
text: Hazel is still too speechless to respond, her eyes fixed on
text: Gus. Eventually Gus answers for them.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Just the check, please.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: No, sir.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Your meal has been paid for by Mr.
dialog: Van Houten.
text: Gus raises his eyebrows at Hazel. This Van Houten guy is
dialog: something else.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT AMSTERDAM CANALS - LATER
text: Hazel and Gus on a park bench, his arm around her, looking
text: out over the water. Seeds blow from the elm trees and the
text: reflections of the city ripple in the water below them.
text: Hazel leans into his body, just a little. They stay like
text: that, savoring the best night of both of their lives. CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT AMSTERDAM - HOTEL - ESTABLISHING
text: A crisp Spring morning in Amsterdam. The buzz in the air
text: outside is equalled by the buzz in:
dialog: 69.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT HOTEL ROOM - SAME
text: Where Hazel excitedly paces through the room.
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: I really don't get that shirt.
text: Hazel wears a screen print t-shirt of Magritte's "Ceci N'est
text: Pas Une Pipe." (A painting of a pipe with words below that
dialog: mean "This is not a pipe.")
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Van Houten will get it. Trust me.
dialog: There are like fifty Magritte
dialog: references in "Imperial
dialog: Affliction."
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
speaker_heading: (READING)
dialog: "This is not a pipe."
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Exactly.
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: But it is a pipe.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
text: No it's not. It's a drawing of a
dialog: pipe. See?
speaker_heading: (SHE DOESN'T)
dialog: All representations of a thing are
text: inherently abstract. A drawing of a
dialog: thing is not the thing itself. Nor
text: is a t-shirt of a drawing of a
dialog: thing the thing itself.
text: Frannie is still at a loss but she's impressed.
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: When did you get so grown up? I
dialog: feel like it was yesterday I was
dialog: telling 8-year old Hazel why the
dialog: sky was blue. You thought I was a
dialog: genius back then.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Why is the sky blue?
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Because I say so.
text: A knock on the door. Gus pokes his head in.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Who's ready for some answers!
dialog: 70.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. VONDELSTRAAT ROW HOUSES - LATER
text: Gus and Hazel stand outside Van Houten's white house.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I'm so excited I can barely
dialog: breathe.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: As opposed to other days...?
text: She playfully hits him. He takes her arm, picks up the oxygen
text: tank, and up they go towards his front door.
text: As they approach, there's a noticeable NOISE coming from
text: inside the house. It's the deep thump of a BASS BEAT. Loud.
text: Like, obnoxiously loud.
text: Hazel grabs the brass ornament and knocks. They wait. There's
dialog: no response.
speaker_heading: GUS
text: Maybe he can't hear over the music?
text: Gus tries again, this time with more force. Still nothing. He
text: tries a third time. Finally, the music stops. They wait.
text: Still excited.
text: A moment later the door swings open.
text: It's a MAN IN PAJAMAS (60s), with a huge potbelly, thinning
text: hair, and a week-old beard. All he says is:
speaker_heading: MAN IN PAJAMAS
dialog: What?!
text: Gus and Hazel look to one another. Could it be?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Mr. Van Houten?
text: At which point, the Pajama Man slams the door in their faces.
text: Hazel and Gus are too stunned to react. Through the closed
dialog: door, they hear this:
speaker_heading: MAN IN PAJAMAS (O.S.)
speaker_heading: (SHOUTING)
scene_heading: LEEE-DUH-VIGH!
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Are they here, Peter?
text: So it is PETER VAN HOUTEN. Gus and Hazel can't believe it.
speaker_heading: MAN IN PAJAMAS (O.S.)
dialog: There are two --
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Who the hell's "they?"
dialog: 71.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: They are Augustus and Hazel, the
dialog: young fans with whom you've been
dialog: corresponding.
text: Gus and Hazel smile at hearing their names. Perhaps this will
dialog: help things take a turn for the better.
speaker_heading: MAN IN PAJAMAS (O.S.)
dialog: The Americans?
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: You invited them, remember?
speaker_heading: MAN IN PAJAMAS (O.S.)
dialog: You know why I left America,
dialog: Lidewij? To never have to encounter
dialog: Americans. Get rid of them.
dialog: Hazel and Gus can't believe it. This is terrible!
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: I will not do this Peter. Be nice.
text: At which point, the door opens - opened by the Woman whose
text: voice they'd been hearing - Van Houten's assistant LIDEWIJ
text: (30s, Dutch, pretty in a bookish way). She virtually shoves
text: Van Houten towards a stunned Gus and Hazel.
text: And they are again face-to-face with Van Houten. One beat,
text: two beats. No one knows what to say. Finally:
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN
dialog: Which of you is Augustus Waters?
text: Gus raises his hand tentatively.
text: Van Houten sizes them up. Without another word, he turns and
text: walks inside - at least this time, leaving the door ajar.
speaker_heading: LIDEWIJ
dialog: Please. I am sorry. Come in.
text: Hazel and Gus share one more awkward glance before Gus takes
text: a step. Hazel follows. They walk:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT VAN HOUTEN'S HOME - SAME
text: Lidewij leads Gus and Hazel into a living room so sterile
text: it's creepy. The walls are empty and white, there's a single
text: couch, a small ottoman, and a single lounge chair. That's it.
text: Van Houten sits in the chair.
text: Off to the side are two large black garbage bags, full and
dialog: twist-tied.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Trash?
dialog: 72.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LIDEWIJ
dialog: Fan mail. 18 years worth. He never
text: opens it.
text: Van Houten kicks his feet up on the ottoman and crosses his
text: slippers. He motions for them to sit on the couch.
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN
dialog: Yours are the first missives to
dialog: which I've replied and look where
dialog: that got me.
text: Hazel and Gus take their seats.
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN
dialog: Scotch?
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Um, no thanks.
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN
dialog: Augustus Waters?
speaker_heading: GUS
text: It's 11am.
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN
dialog: Just me then, Lidewij. Scotch and
dialog: soda.
speaker_heading: LIDEWIJ
dialog: Perhaps some breakfast first Peter?
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN
dialog: She thinks I have a drinking
dialog: problem.
speaker_heading: LIDEWIJ
dialog: I also think the Earth is round.
text: Nevertheless, Lidewij pours Peter half a glass and hands it
text: to him. He takes a sip, then sits up straight.
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN
dialog: So you like my book.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Yes. We - well, Augustus, he made
dialog: meeting you his Wish so that we
dialog: could come here and talk to you.
text: Van Houten says nothing. Takes a long pull on his drink.
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN
dialog: Did you dress like her on purpose?
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: (looks at her shirt)
dialog: Kinda.
dialog: 73.
dialog: 
text: Van Houten says nothing to that.
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN
dialog: I do not have a drinking problem. I
dialog: have a Churchillian relationship
dialog: with alcohol: I can crack jokes and
dialog: govern England and do anything I
dialog: want to do. Except not drink.
text: He glances over at Lidewij, who dutifully refills his glass.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Incidentally, thank you for dinner
dialog: last night.
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN
speaker_heading: (TO LIDEWIJ)
dialog: We bought them dinner last night?
speaker_heading: LIDEWIJ
dialog: It was our pleasure.
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN
speaker_heading: (SIGHS)
dialog: You've come a long way so... what
dialog: is it I can do for you?
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: We have some questions --
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN
dialog: Uh-huh...
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: About what happens, you know...
dialog: after... the end of your book.
dialog: Specifically to those who Anna
dialog: leaves behind. Like her Mom, the
dialog: Dutch Tulip Man, Sisy --
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN
speaker_heading: (INTERRUPTING)
dialog: How familiar are you with Swedish
dialog: hip-hop?
text: Hazel looks at Gus. Is he kidding?
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I would say... limited?
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN
dialog: But presumably you know Afasi Och
dialog: Filthy's seminal album "Flacken."
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Um...
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN
dialog: Lidewij! Play `Bomfalleralla'
dialog: immediately.
dialog: 74.
dialog: 
text: Lidewij sighs but she does as she's told. A few seconds
text: later, some loud Swedish rap song blasts from the speakers.
text: Hazel and Gus sit through this, totally baffled.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: (yelling over the music)
dialog: I'm sorry, sir. We don't speak
dialog: Swedish.
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN
speaker_heading: (YELLING)
dialog: Who the hell speaks Swedish? The
dialog: important thing is not what
text: nonsense the voices are saying, but
text: what the voices are feeling.
text: The song continues another awkward ten seconds or so before
text: Gus has enough. He gets up and turns off the music.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Are you messing with us?
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN
dialog: Pardon?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Is this some kind of performance?
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN
dialog: Rudolf Otto said that if you had
dialog: not encountered the numinous then
dialog: his work was not for you. And I say
dialog: to you, my friends, if you cannot
dialog: hear Afasi Och Filthy's bravadic
dialog: response to fearfulness, then my
dialog: work is not for you.
dialog: Hazel is really getting worried at this point. They came all
dialog: this way for this?
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: So anyway... when the book ends,
dialog: Anna's mom --
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN
text: (raising a hand to silence
speaker_heading: HER)
dialog: Let us imagine that you are racing
dialog: a tortoise.
text: Hazel and Gus fidget in their seats. Lidewij frowns, clearly
text: feeling bad for them. Van Houten continues.
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN
text: The tortoise has a ten yard head
dialog: start. In the time it takes you to
text: run ten yards, the tortoise has
dialog: moved maybe one yard. And so on,
dialog: forever.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN (CONT'D)
dialog: You are faster than the tortoise
dialog: but you can never catch him, you
dialog: see, you can only decrease his
dialog: lead. Now certainly you can run
dialog: past the tortoise as long as you
dialog: don't contemplate the mechanics
dialog: involved but the question of how
text: turns out to be so complicated that
dialog: no one really solved it until
dialog: Cantor's proof that some infinities
dialog: are bigger than other infinities.
text: Hazel and Gus have no idea how to respond.
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN
dialog: I assume that answers your
dialog: questions.
speaker_heading: GUS
speaker_heading: (TO HAZEL)
dialog: I don't know what's going on.
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN
dialog: And yet you seemed so intelligent
dialog: in print, Mr. Waters.
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: Must be all that cancer in your
dialog: brain.
speaker_heading: LIDEWIJ
dialog: Peter!
text: Gus could throw a punch right now. Hazel tries to calm the
dialog: situation.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Can we please, maybe, talk about
dialog: Anna for a sec? I mean, I
dialog: understand that the story ends mid-
dialog: sentence because she dies or she
dialog: becomes too sick to continue --
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN
dialog: I'm not interested in talking about
dialog: that book.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: - but that doesn't mean her family
dialog: and everyone she loves doesn't have
dialog: a future, right?
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN
dialog: I said I'm not interested --
speaker_heading: HAZEL
speaker_heading: (GETTING UPSET)
dialog: But you promised!
speaker_heading: (CALMS HERSELF)
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: HAZEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Mr. Van Houten, you said you would
dialog: tell us what happens and that's why
dialog: we're here. We... I need you tell
dialog: me. Surely you've thought about it.
dialog: I mean, as characters --
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN
dialog: Nothing happens to them! They're
dialog: fictions. They cease to exist the
text: moment the novel is over.
dialog: This is not what Hazel came all this way to hear. She won't
dialog: accept it.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: They can't!
dialog: (again, has to calm
speaker_heading: HERSELF)
dialog: I mean, I understand. In a literary
dialog: sense. But it's impossible NOT to
dialog: imagine some future --
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN
dialog: I can't do this. Lidewij, get rid
dialog: of them, please.
dialog: (Lidewij doesn't move, he
dialog: turns back to Hazel)
dialog: I won't indulge your childish
dialog: whims. I refuse to pity you in the
dialog: manner in which you're accustomed.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I don't want your pity --
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN
dialog: Of course you do. Like all sick
dialog: kids, your existence depends on it.
speaker_heading: LIDEWIJ
dialog: Peter!
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN
dialog: (on a roll)
dialog: You are fated to live out your days
dialog: as the child you were when
dialog: diagnosed, the child who believes
text: there is life after a novel ends.
dialog: And we, as adults, we pity this, so
dialog: we pay for your treatments, for
dialog: your oxygen machines. We give you
dialog: food and water though you are
dialog: unlikely to live long enough --
speaker_heading: LIDEWIJ
speaker_heading: PETER!
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN
dialog: You are a side effect of an
dialog: evolutionary process that cares
dialog: little for individual lives.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN (CONT'D)
dialog: You are a failed experiment in
dialog: mutation.
speaker_heading: LIDEWIJ
speaker_heading: I RESIGN!
text: Lidewij has tears in her eyes. Gus has balled his fists. But
text: not Hazel. Van Houten's words have not phased her one bit.
text: She rises from the couch.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Hey listen douchepants. You're not
dialog: gonna tell me anything I don't
dialog: already know about illness. I need
dialog: one thing and one thing only from
dialog: you before I walk out of your life
dialog: and that's for you to tell me what
dialog: happens to your goddman characters!
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I cannot tell you.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Bullshit!
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN
dialog: I cannot --
text: Van Houten goes to take a drink but...
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Make something up.
text: ... Hazel smacks it right the fuck out of his hands,
dialog: surprising everyone.
text: After a beat:
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN
dialog: Lidewij. I'll have a martini
dialog: please.
speaker_heading: LIDEWIJ
dialog: I have resigned.
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN
dialog: Oh don't be ridiculous.
text: No one moves. Van Houten realizes he's alone in this.
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN
dialog: I'd like you to leave now.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: You're really not gonna tell us?
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN
dialog: I would like you... to leave.
dialog: 78.
dialog: 
text: Hazel is furious. Gus stands next to her, touches her arm is
dialog: if to say "come on, enough of this guy." CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT VAN HOUTEN'S HOUSE - SAME
text: Gus and Hazel come out of the house, practically shaking. As
text: they get to the street, Van Houten has one more thing to say.
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN
dialog: Have you ever stopped to ask why
dialog: you care so much about your silly
dialog: questions?
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Go fuck yourself.
text: Van Houten doesn't have a response to that. He just shuts the
text: door. And when he does, that's when Hazel gets emotional.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Hey. It's ok. It's ok...
dialog: (beat, an idea)
dialog: I'll write you a sequel.
dialog: (she cries harder)
dialog: I will. Better than any shit that
dialog: drunk could write. With blood and
dialog: guts and sacrifice. You'll love it.
text: Hazel nods, then wipes away tears. She fakes a smile and Gus
text: gives her a hug. Afterwards:
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I spent your Wish on that asshole.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: You did not spend it on him. You
dialog: spent it on us.
text: They embrace once more.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I wanted...
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I know... I know. Apparently the
dialog: world is not a wish-granting
dialog: factory.
text: This gets a real smile from Hazel. That's when Lidewij comes
text: outside. Clearly she's been crying too.
speaker_heading: LIDEWIJ
dialog: I'm so sorry. Circumstance has made
dialog: him cruel. I thought meeting you
dialog: would help him, if he would see
dialog: that his work has shaped real
dialog: lives, but... I'm very sorry.
dialog: 79.
dialog: 
text: Hazel says nothing. Gus holds her in a very protective way.
speaker_heading: LIDEWIJ
dialog: Perhaps we can do some sightseeing.
dialog: Have you seen the Anne Frank House?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I'm not going anywhere with that
dialog: monster.
speaker_heading: LIDEWIJ
text: He is not invited.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT ANNE FRANK HOUSE - LATER
text: Lidewij walks back from the ticket kiosk with more bad news.
speaker_heading: LIDEWIJ
dialog: I'm afraid there's no elevator.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Oh, um, that's alright.
speaker_heading: LIDEWIJ
dialog: No, there are many stairs. Steep
dialog: stairs.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I can do it.
speaker_heading: GUS
speaker_heading: HAZEL --
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I can do it!
dialog: Hazel is not going to stand for any more disappointments
text: today. They are going inside. CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT ANNE FRANK HOUSE - GROUND FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER
text: A VIDEO plays on a MONITOR showing the Nazi invasion of
text: Holland. Hazel and Gus stand with Lidewij in a pack of
text: BACKPACKERS and TRAVELERS about to take the tour. Many of
text: them begin to walk up the first flight of stairs.
speaker_heading: LIDEWIJ
dialog: Shall we?
text: Hazel nods. Both Hazel and Gus walk slowly up the stairs. So
text: far so good. They find themselves in an office space.
speaker_heading: LIDEWIJ
dialog: This is the bookcase that hid the
text: Frank family and four others.
text: The BOOKCASE is half open. Behind it is an even steeper set
text: of stairs, only wide enough for one person at a time.
dialog: 80.
dialog: 
text: Some of the Travelers begin to walk up the stairs. Gus looks
dialog: at Hazel - are you sure we should continue? She begins the
text: climb, determined. Lidewij trails behind, carrying her oxygen
dialog: tank.
text: Hazel moves very slowly. We are aware of her labored
text: breathing the entire time.
text: ANGLE ON OTHER TOURISTS, watching and quietly commenting.
text: Just like at the airport, except now in foreign languages.
text: Hazel arrives on the NEXT FLOOR - an empty room. She's
text: definitely starting to struggle. She leans against the wall
text: to catch her breath. Gus comes to her side, wipes her brow.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: You're a champion.
text: Hazel smiles. When she's feeling up to it they walk into the
text: next room, also empty. And another staircase, even more
text: narrow and steep - practically a ladder. When Gus sees this
text: he looks at Hazel:
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: That's enough --
speaker_heading: HAZEL
speaker_heading: (RESOLUTE)
dialog: I'm ok.
text: Hazel very slowly begins the climb. Again we're aware of her
text: every breath. It's dark. And it's becoming very difficult.
text: Near the top Hazel stumbles but is finally able to pull
dialog: herself through.
text: Once there, she falls to the floor, slumping against the
text: wall, trying to catch her breath. Gus crouches next to her.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: We're at the top. That's it.
text: Hazel becomes aware that TOURISTS look at her with concern.
text: She smiles, stands up, nothing to see here.
text: And now they're in the final room - a long, narrow hallway.
dialog: This is where Anne Frank and 7 other people lived in hiding
text: for as long as they could. There's a TIME LINE detailing
dialog: their story.
speaker_heading: LIDEWIJ
dialog: The only member of the whole family
dialog: to survive was Otto, Anne's father.
text: Gus takes Hazel's hand.
speaker_heading: LIDEWIJ
dialog: I don't know how you go on, without
dialog: your family.
dialog: 81.
dialog: 
text: Lidewij stays behind to study part of the exhibit. Gus leads
text: Hazel into the room at the end of the hallway where a VIDEO
text: details the last days of Anne Frank's life. Over it, we hear
text: a YOUNG GIRL's VOICE reading from the diary.
text: The Travelers stand to watch and listen. Gus and Hazel do the
text: same. The room is dark.
speaker_heading: GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: "At such moment's, I don't think
dialog: about the misery..."
text: Gus and Hazel stand very closely together. The video is the
text: cherry on top of a very emotional day. Hazel watches it.
speaker_heading: GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: "...but about the beauty that still
dialog: remains."
text: Gus, meanwhile, is just watching Hazel, the same way she
text: watched him on the airplane. After a beat, she catches him.
text: Their eyes meet. The emotions build...
speaker_heading: GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: "Try to recapture the happiness
dialog: within yourself. Think of all the
dialog: beauty in everything around you...
dialog: and be happy."
text: And Hazel KISSES Gus. A most passionate, intense, you-and-me-
dialog: against-the-world kind of kiss, better than any they've
dialog: experienced or could even imagine. It seems to last for a
dialog: small eternity.
text: Eventually, they break away and open their eyes. They quickly
text: notice all the Travelers staring at them. For a brief second,
dialog: they wonder if that was a very inappropriate thing to do...
text: When suddenly everyone starts clapping for them, moved by the
text: whole thing. One EUROPEAN even shouts "bravo!" Hazel blushes,
text: Gus smiles, bows, he grabs her hand. CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT GUS'S HOTEL ROOM - LATER
text: They fall onto Gus's bed, kissing. Hazel is very in the
text: moment and now it's Gus who seems nervous. As they kiss:
speaker_heading: GUS
text: It's above my knee.
text: She ignores him, more kissing. She takes off his shirt.
speaker_heading: GUS
text: It tapers a little and then it's
dialog: just skin --
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: What?
dialog: 82.
dialog: 
text: Hazel pulls away from him.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: My leg.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Just so you're prepared --
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Oh get over yourself.
text: Hazel kisses him again. Now he tries to pull her shirt off
text: but it gets tangled in with her oxygen tube. He can't figure
text: it out. Eventually the whole thing is hilarious to them. They
dialog: shake their heads - laughing - certainly not your typical
dialog: Hollywood movie moment. And yet, for them:
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I love you, Augustus Waters.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I love you too, Hazel Grace.
text: They resume kissing. And we CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT HOTEL ROOM - MORNING
text: Gus wakes up in the bed. He looks around for Hazel but she
text: isn't there. On the bed is a piece of paper. A note.
dialog: It reads: "Dearest Augustus..."
text: Beneath that is a BIG CIRCLE, labeled "Virgins." And in that
text: circle is a SMALLER SECOND CIRCLE labeled "17 year old dudes
dialog: with one leg." We'll notice part of that circle is now
text: outside the bigger circle. Gus flashes that signature smile.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT CAFE - DAY
text: Hazel and Gus sit with Frannie drinking coffee in the sun at
text: an outdoor cafe. They're re-enacting yesterday's events.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: "Get up you fat bastard."
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: "I can't stand up, I'm too drunk."
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I said "get up."
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: "Standing is for fools!"
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: God, what an asshole.
text: They both giggle at the whole thing.
dialog: 83.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: It was awful, Mom. You can't
dialog: imagine.
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: And then what happened?
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Then we went to the Anne Frank
dialog: museum.
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: And after that?
text: A quick glance between Hazel and Gus.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: We just... walked around.
text: Hazel and Gus smile, thoroughly in love but trying to keep it
text: in check in front of her Mother.
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: Sounds lovely.
text: A few beats later.
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: Listen... I'm gonna stretch my legs
dialog: a little. Give the two of you some
dialog: time to talk.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
speaker_heading: (THAT'S WEIRD)
dialog: Um... ok...
text: As she stands up to leave, Hazel thinks she catches Gus and
text: Frannie making eye contact for a brief second. Once Frannie
dialog: has left them:
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: That was weird.
text: Gus doesn't respond except to say:
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Shall we?
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT AMSTERDAM STREET - LATER
text: They start to walk. Gus takes a cigarette out of his pack,
text: sticks it between his lips. Hazel notices he's struggling
dialog: with something.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Augustus?
dialog: 84.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: There's something I have to tell
dialog: you...
text: They walk in silence a few beats.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Just before you went into the
dialog: hospital... There was this... I
dialog: felt this... ache in my hip.
text: Hazel grabs onto his arm, a lump already forming.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Oh no...
text: Gus takes the cigarette out of his mouth, clenches his teeth
text: tightly, trying not to cry.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I had a PET scan.
text: Gus sits down on a BENCH. Looks up at her. Tries to smile.
text: Before he even says it, she knows.
speaker_heading: GUS
text: It lit up like a Christmas tree,
dialog: Hazel...
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Oh god.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: The lining of my chest, my liver...
dialog: everywhere.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Oh my god no!
text: Hazel loses it in that moment, falling on top of him, hugging
text: him for dear life, her head in his lap.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I'm so sorry, Augustus. I'm so so
speaker_heading: SORRY --
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I'm sorry too --
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: It's so unfair --
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I should have told you --
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: It's so fucking unfair!
text: A beat. Gus still trying not to cry.
dialog: 85.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Apparently the world is... not a
dialog: wish-granting factory.
text: And at that point, Gus lets it go, lets himself cry and be
dialog: sad and feel awful.
text: But just for a second. Then he shakes it off, pulls Hazel's
text: face up to his, tries again to smile through the tears.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Don't you worry about me, Hazel
dialog: Grace. I'll find a way to hang
dialog: around and annoy you for a long
dialog: time.
text: She hugs him, perhaps a little too tightly. He winces.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Does it hurt?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: It's ok.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I'm ok.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Ok.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Ok.
dialog: But of course it's not ok. Not by a mile.
text: Hazel takes a moment to look at him, touches his cheek.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I'm just... I'm very fond of you.
text: He grabs her hand and holds it.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I don't suppose you can forget
dialog: about it, treat me like I'm not
dialog: dying.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I don't think you're dying,
dialog: Augustus. You've just got a touch
dialog: of cancer.
text: Gus nods. Squeezes her hand.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Would it be absolutely ludicrous to
dialog: make out right now?
dialog: 86.
dialog: 
text: Hazel doesn't answer. She just kisses him, hard. And on the
text: two of them, so in love, we CUT TO:

scene_heading: INT AIRPLANE - LATER
text: Hazel lays on Gus's shoulder as he stares out the window,
text: leaving Amsterdam behind.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT INDIANAPOLIS AIRPORT - BAGGAGE CLAIM - DAY
text: As they ride down the escalator, Hazel sees Michael standing
text: amongst the livery drivers. He holds a sign that says -
dialog: instead of someone's last name - "My Beautiful Family (and
dialog: Gus)."
text: Upon seeing them, he immediately starts to cry of course. He
text: kisses his wife, gives Hazel a big hug. Gus goes to shake his
text: hand but Michael hugs him as well. CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT HAZEL'S LIVING ROOM - THAT NIGHT
text: Hazel sits with her father on the couch.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
text: Gus had a recurrence.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
speaker_heading: (NODS)
dialog: Mrs. Waters told us the night
dialog: before you left.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I'm sorry Hazel.
text: They sit for a beat. Tears form in Michael's eyes.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: You're not gonna say it?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: The usual. "Everything happens for
dialog: a reason..."
text: Michael shakes his head.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I don't know, Haze.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I always thought being an adult
dialog: meant knowing what you believe...
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: ... that has not been my

text: Hazel understands exactly. CUT TO:
dialog: 87.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT GUS'S BASEMENT BEDROOM - DAY
text: Gus lays in bed, eyes open, a PICC line now being fed through
text: a port in his chest. Chemotherapy at work.
text: Hazel and Isaac are keeping him company.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: How are your eyes?
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Great. Wonderful. I mean, they're
dialog: not in my head is the only problem.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I hate to one-up you but... seems
dialog: my entire body is made out of
dialog: cancer now, so...
text: Isaac nods. Tries not to get emotional but it's happening. He
text: goes to touch Gus's arm and accidentally touches his thigh.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Whoa, I'm taken.
text: Isaac laughs.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: (to Hazel, re: Gus)
dialog: Did you write his eulogy yet?
text: Hazel is confused.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Dude.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I haven't asked her.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Oops.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: My bad.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
speaker_heading: (STILL CONFUSED)
dialog: Augustus?
text: Gus looks at her, grows a little serious.
dialog: 88.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I need speakers at my funeral. I
dialog: thought maybe you and Isaac... but
dialog: especially you --
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Hey!
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Would you be kind enough to whip
dialog: something up?
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: (touches his hand)
dialog: It would be an honor.
text: They hold holds.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: You guys are adorable.
text: Hazel play slaps Isaac on the arm.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: How's your love life? Anything from
dialog: Monica?
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Not a word.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: She hasn't even like, texted to ask
dialog: how you're doing?
text: He shakes his head. Gus gets an angry look on his face.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: That is so messed up!
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: I've stopped thinking about it.
text: Moving on. There's a new girl in
dialog: Support Group with these humongous -
text: Isaac gestures to his chest. Hazel is confused.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: How do you even know that?
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: I'm blind but I'm not that blind.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Hazel Grace!
text: They turn to him.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Do you happen to have four dollars?
dialog: 89.
dialog: 
text: No one knows what that means. CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT HAZEL'S CAR - LATER
text: Gus is in the passenger's seat. Isaac sits in the back. Hazel
text: returns to the car. With a CARTON OF EGGS.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Ok now what?
text: Gus smiles. CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT SUBURBAN STREET - MOMENTS LATER
text: Hazel, Gus, and Isaac lean against Hazel's car staring
dialog: something down.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Is it there?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Oh it's there.
text: REVEAL they're looking at Monica's green Firebird.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: She's in the house?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Who cares where she is? This is not
dialog: about her. This is about you.
dialog: (sticks out his hand)
dialog: Hazel...
text: Hazel nods, opens the egg carton, hands Gus an egg. Gus puts
text: it in Isaac's hands. Positions Isaac - who, of course, can't
text: see a thing - towards the Firebird.
text: Isaac winds up and tosses the EGG.
text: It misses the car by a mile. After a beat:
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: I didn't hear anything.
speaker_heading: GUS
text: A little to the left.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: My throw was to the left or I
dialog: should aim to the left?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Aim left.
text: Isaac turns his shoulders.
dialog: 90.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Lefter.
text: Isaac turns some more.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Yes! Excellent! And throw hard.
text: Gus hands him a SECOND EGG. Isaac winds up and hurls it -
text: missing the car again but hitting the HOUSE.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Bullseye!
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: No you missed it by like 20 feet.
dialog: (hands him a THIRD)
dialog: Try one more time.
text: Isaac hurls it, this time smashing the car's taillight.
text: Isaac's face lights up.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Woo hoo!
text: Isaac grabs for ANOTHER EGG. Throws it. Then ANOTHER. He's a
text: throwing machine. Most of them miss but at least he's
text: enjoying himself. Finally there's a DIRECT HIT on the car
text: door, triggering the alarm. Isaac pauses.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Keep throwing, keep throwing!
text: Isaac does. Gus smiles, putting an unlit cigarette in his
text: mouth. Hazel watches him, enjoying this moment.
text: Eventually, MONICA'S MOM opens the front door and comes out.
speaker_heading: MONICA'S MOM
dialog: What in God's name --
text: Seeing Hazel, Gus, and Isaac, she stops in her tracks.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Are you Monica's mom?
speaker_heading: MONICA'S MOM
speaker_heading: (CONFUSED)
dialog: I am.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Hello ma'am. Your daughter has done
dialog: an injustice and we've come here
dialog: seeking revenge. We may not look
dialog: like much. Between the three of us,
dialog: we have five legs, four eyes, and
text: two and a half working lungs.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: GUS (CONT'D)
dialog: But we also have two dozen eggs. So
dialog: If I was you, I would go back
dialog: inside.
text: Monica's Mom is very confused. A beat. Without another word,
text: she turns and goes back inside. The three of them celebrate.
text: As Isaac picks up where he left off, Hazel gently kisses Gus
text: on the cheek. And over we hear:
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: A few days later, Gus landed in the
text: hospital with chest pains.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM - DAY
text: Hazel bounds in to find Mrs. Waters in the waiting room. She
text: stands to hug Hazel. They both sit down.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: How's he doing?
speaker_heading: MRS. WATERS
dialog: He's had a tough night, Hazel. His
dialog: blood pressure's low. His heart --
text: Mrs. Waters starts to cry.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: What about the chemo?
speaker_heading: MRS. WATERS
dialog: (shakes her head)
dialog: They're gonna stop the chemo.
text: They both know what that means. Mrs. Waters gathers herself.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Can I see him?
speaker_heading: MRS. WATERS
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: We have to be a family now.
text: Hazel nods. She understands.
speaker_heading: MRS. WATERS
dialog: We'll tell him you were here.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: If you don't mind, I'll just hang
dialog: for a while.
text: Mrs. Waters nods, hugs her again, walks out through the heavy
text: doors towards Gus's room. Hazel sits in the chair. Same chair
text: Gus sat in while waiting for her. They've switched places.
dialog: 92.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT INDIANAPOLIS MUSEUM OF ART - DAY
text: Hazel pushes Gus, now confined to a WHEELCHAIR, to their spot
text: on the hill overlooking "Funky Bones." A second picnic, this
text: time with champagne. Hazel pours some for them both into
text: little Winnie the Pooh cups. She's trying to be upbeat - but
text: it's difficult. Gus watches the kids play on the bones.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: What are you thinking about?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Oblivion.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Augustus...
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I know it's kid's stuff but... I
dialog: always thought I'd have a grand
dialog: story to tell, you know? Something
dialog: that would run in all the papers. I
dialog: always thought I was special.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: You are.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Yeah but... you know what I mean.
text: Hazel, annoyed finishes her cup, tosses it to the side. Gus
dialog: can tell he's said something wrong.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I do know what you mean, I just...
dialog: I don't agree.
text: Hazel stands up, anger building.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: This obsession with being
speaker_heading: REMEMBERED --
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Don't get mad --
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: But I am mad!
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I think you're special, is that not
dialog: enough?
speaker_heading: GUS
speaker_heading: HAZEL --
dialog: 93.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: You think the only way to live a
dialog: meaningful life is for everyone to
dialog: love you, for everyone to remember
dialog: you. Well guess what, Gus, this is
dialog: your life. This is all you get. You
dialog: get me, and your family, and this
dialog: world. And if that's not enough,
dialog: well I'm sorry, but it's not
dialog: nothing. Cause I'll remember you,
dialog: I'll love you --
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: You're right --
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: And I just wish... I just wish
dialog: you'd be happy with that.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: You're right. I'm sorry.
dialog: (pulling her back down)
dialog: I'm sorry.
text: Gus hands Hazel another Winnie the Pooh cup. Raises his to
text: hers in a toast.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: It's a good life, Hazel Grace.
text: She softens. They toast.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: It's not over yet, you know.
text: Gus nods. Of course it isn't. And yet they both know there
text: isn't much time. CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - ANOTHER NIGHT
text: Hazel is asleep. Suddenly, her phone buzzes. She looks at it -
text: "Gus" - then she looks at the clock - 2:35am. A pit grows in
text: her stomach. A quick panicked beat before she answers:
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: GUS (O.S.)
speaker_heading: (WEAKLY)
dialog: Hazel Grace.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
speaker_heading: (RELIEVED)
dialog: Oh, thank God. Hi. Hi, I love you!
speaker_heading: GUS (O.S.)
dialog: I'm at the gas station --
dialog: 94.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: GUS (O.S.)
dialog: Something's wrong. You gotta...
dialog: please come help me.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT/ EXT HAZEL'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER
text: Hazel drives like a maniac down the street, eventually
text: finding herself at the Speedway gas station.
text: Gus's car is alone in the parking lot and she pulls up next
text: to it. She gets out of her car, opens his driver's side door,
text: and finds him sitting there, his shirt stained with vomit and
text: blood. She gags from the smell.
speaker_heading: GUS
speaker_heading: (MUMBLING)
dialog: Hi.
text: Hazel looks down at his hands which are pressed tightly to
text: his belly. She sees something is leaking from the TUBE
text: sticking out of it.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
speaker_heading: (PANICKED)
dialog: Oh, God, Augustus, I'm calling 911.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: No! Please! Hazel, listen to me. Do
dialog: not call 911 or my parents -- I'll
dialog: never forgive you -- Don't, please.
text: Gus starts to cry.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Please just look at it.
text: Hazel lifts up his shirt. His ABDOMEN is bright red.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I think it's infected...
text: Hazel feels his forehead, he's burning up.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Gus, what the -- why are you here?
dialog: Why aren't you home?
text: Gus throws up. He doesn't even have the energy to turn his
text: mouth away from his lap.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Oh, sweetie...
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I wanted to buy some cigarettes. I
dialog: lost my pack. Or they took it.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: GUS (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't know. They said they'd get
dialog: me another one but I wanted... to
dialog: do it myself. Do one little thing
dialog: myself.
text: Hazel doesn't know what to do.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I can't fix this. I have to call
dialog: someone. I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: No, Hazel, please!
text: But she must. She gets out her cell phone and dials. At which
text: point, Gus really loses it, weeping like the poisoned, dying
text: teenage boy that he is. As Hazel dials, we hear:
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: I wish I could say Augustus Waters
dialog: kept his sense of humor till the
dialog: end, did not for a moment waiver in
dialog: his courage and his spirit soared
text: like an eagle to the sky...
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (to himself, shaking)
dialog: I hate myself I hate myself I hate
dialog: this I hate this...
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: ...but that is not what happened.
text: LATER. An EMT loads Gus into the back of an AMBULANCE. Hazel
text: is allowed to ride with him in the back. As the car starts
text: moving, Gus grabs her hand.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Read me something.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Read you something?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Do you know any poems?
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I know one.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Read it to me.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: "The Red Wheelbarrow" by William
dialog: Carlos Williams.

dialog: "So much depends / upon / a red
dialog: wheel / barrow / glazed with rain /
dialog: water / beside the white /
dialog: chickens."
dialog: 96.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUS
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Is that it?
text: That is it. But there's another ten minutes of driving to do.
text: Hazel thinks fast.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: No of course not. Um... what
dialog: else...
speaker_heading: (THINKS)
dialog: so much depends/ upon a blue sky/
dialog: cut open by the branches/ of the
dialog: trees./ So much depends/ on the
text: transparent G-tube/ erupting from
text: the belly/ of the blue-lipped boy.
text: Gus smiles, weakly, barely conscious. Hazel cradles his head
text: in her arms. And continues...
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: So much depends upon this observer/
dialog: of the universe...
text: As Gus is drifting off to sleep, WE HEAR:
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: One of the less bull-shitty
dialog: conventions of the cancer genre is
dialog: the convention known as the "Last
dialog: Good Day..."
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT GUS'S HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY

text: he lives. Hazel is there to help get him inside.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT GUS'S HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY
text: Gus no longer sleeps in his basement. Nor does he sleep in
text: his own bed. He sleeps in a HOSPITAL BED set up in a guest
text: room. Hazel is with him. They're watching sports on TV.
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: This is where the victim of cancer
text: finds himself unexpectedly with
dialog: some hours...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT GUS'S BACKYARD PORCH - ANOTHER DAY
text: Hazel and Gus getting some fresh air. She sits there reading
text: a book. Gus just sits there. His eyes staring off into
text: nothing. Hazel waves to him. Gus looks over, as if waking
text: from a dream. She manages a smile. He manages one back.
dialog: 97.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: ... when it seems like the
text: inexorable decline has suddenly
dialog: plateaued, when the pain is for a
dialog: minute bearable.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT HAZEL'S DINING ROOM - ANOTHER DAY
text: Hazel sits at dinner with her parents. She is barely touching
dialog: her food.
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: The problem, of course, is that
dialog: there's no way of knowing that your
dialog: last good day is your "Last Good
dialog: Day." At the time, it's just
dialog: another decent day.
text: The phone buzzes and Hazel answers it.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Hi, Augustus.
speaker_heading: GUS (O.S.)
dialog: Good evening, Hazel Grace.
text: His voice is strong today, and Hazel is happy to hear it.
speaker_heading: GUS (O.S.)
dialog: Quick question for you. Did you
dialog: ever write that eulogy I asked you
dialog: to prepare?
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I may have...
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Excellent. Do you think you could
dialog: find yourself at the Literal Heart
dialog: of Jesus in 20 minutes.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Um... sure. Is everything --
speaker_heading: GUS (O.S.)
dialog: I love you Hazel.
text: The call ends. Hazel, confused, stands to go.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I gotta go.
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: Finish eating first.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I can't, I have to meet Gus.

speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: You haven't eaten a thing.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I'm not hungry.
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: You can't not eat, Hazel.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I am aggressively unhungry, ok?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
speaker_heading: HAZEL --
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I have to go.
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: Sit down.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Hazel, listen to your mother.
text: Hazel tries to push past her but Frannie grabs her shoulders.
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: You have to eat, Hazel. You're not
dialog: gonna starve yourself to death just
dialog: because Gus is sick. You have to
dialog: stay healthy --
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I can't! I can't stay healthy
dialog: because I'm not healthy, Mom. I am
dialog: dying. I am going to die and leave
dialog: you here alone and you won't have
dialog: me to hover around and you won't be
dialog: a mother anymore, and I'm sorry,
dialog: but I can't do anything about it,
dialog: ok?! Just leave me alone!
text: Upon seeing her mother's face change, Hazel immediately
dialog: regrets this.
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: You heard me?
text: Frannie has tears in her eyes. Hazel looks away, feeling
dialog: terrible.
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: You heard me say that to your
dialog: father?
text: Frannie sits down on the couch with her daughter.
dialog: 99.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: Oh god, sweetie. I'm sorry. I was
dialog: wrong, ok? It wasn't true. It's not
dialog: something I believe.
text: Michael sits across from them.
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: As long as either of us is alive, I
dialog: will be your mother. Even if you
dialog: die, I --
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: When.
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: Even when you die, I will still be
dialog: your mother. I will always be your
dialog: Mother.
text: By now Michael is crying too. They all are.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I worry that you won't have a life.
dialog: That you'll sit around all day with
dialog: no me to look after and stare at
dialog: the walls and be miserable or off
dialog: yourselves or something.
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: We're not gonna off ourselves. It's
dialog: gonna hurt like hell to lose you
speaker_heading: BUT --
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Hazel. You of all people know it's
dialog: possible to live with pain.
text: She takes that in. It rings true to her. Hazel nods.
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: I don't just sit around, you know.
text: Hazel is confused. Frannie looks at Michael like, "should I
text: say something?" She goes for it.
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: I'm taking some classes. Online. To
dialog: get my master's in social work.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: You are?
text: Hazel is stunned.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: So when you're waiting for me
dialog: outside Support Group or whatever,
dialog: you're always --
dialog: 100.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: Working or reading. If I get my
dialog: MSW, I can council families in
dialog: crisis or lead groups dealing with
speaker_heading: ILLNESS --
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Why didn't you tell me?
text: Frannie and Michael don't quite know what to say.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: We didn't want you to feel
speaker_heading: ABANDONED --
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Are you kidding? Mom, this is
dialog: awesome! This is fantastic! Oh my
dialog: god!
text: Hazel grabs her Mom for a hug.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I'm so excited! You're gonna be so
dialog: great, Mom!
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: Thank you. That means everything to

dialog: the way, will you speak at my
dialog: funeral?
text: Hazel looks at him like "of course, silly" and then kisses
text: him on the mouth.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Sweet. I'm hopeful I'll get to
dialog: attend as a ghost, but just to make
dialog: sure, I thought I'd - well, not to
dialog: put you on the spot, but I thought
dialog: I'd arrange a pre-funeral.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Why now?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: No time like the present.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: (looks around the room)
dialog: How did you even get in here?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Would you believe they leave the
dialog: door open at night?
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Um, no.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: As well you shouldn't.
text: He smiles and for a brief moment it's old Gus. Hazel laughs.
text: Isaac clears his throat.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: "Augustus Waters was a self-
dialog: aggrandizing bastard. But we
dialog: forgive him. We forgive him... not
dialog: because he had a heart as
dialog: figuratively good as his actual one
dialog: sucked, or because he got 18 years
dialog: when he should have gotten more."
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: I'm assuming you've got some time,
dialog: you interrupting bastard! I mean
dialog: seriously...
dialog: (back to the speech)
dialog: "Augustus Waters talked so much
dialog: that he'd interrupt you at his own
dialog: funeral. And he was pretentious.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: ISAAC (CONT'D)
dialog: Sweet Jesus that kid never took a
dialog: piss without pondering the
dialog: resonances of human waste
dialog: production. And he was vain. But
dialog: that comes with superhuman
dialog: handsomeness."
text: Gus nods - that part is true.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: "But I will say this: when the
text: scientists of the future show up at
dialog: my house with robot eyes and they
dialog: tell me to try them on, I will tell
dialog: the scientists to piss off, because
dialog: I don't even want to see a world
dialog: without Augustus Waters."
text: Hazel smiles - but it's one that triggers an immediate
dialog: emotional waterfall.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: "And then, of course, having made
dialog: my rhetorical point, I will put my
dialog: robot eyes on because, I mean...
dialog: robot eyes!"
text: Gus has a big smile on his face.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: "So anyway, Augustus, my friend...
dialog: Godspeed."
text: Gus nods a couple times.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Thank you Isaac.
text: This causes Isaac to lose it. He clings to the lectern.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Goddamn it, Gus.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Hey don't swear in the Literal
dialog: Heart of Jesus.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Shit! Ass! Balls!
text: Isaac sighs. Wipes away the tears. And another beat passes.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Can I get a hand here, Hazel?
text: Hazel remembers Isaac can't see. She rises, goes up to get
text: him, walks him back to her seat.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Hazel Grace, it's down to you.
dialog: 103.
dialog: 
text: Hazel takes out a piece of paper, walks up to the dais. Takes
text: a beat to ready herself.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: "Augustus Waters was the great star-
dialog: crossed love of my life. Ours was
dialog: an epic love story, and I won't be
dialog: able to get more than a sentence
text: into it without disappearing into a
text: puddle of tears.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Like all real love stories - ours
dialog: will die with us, as it should. I'd
dialog: hoped that he'd be eulogizing me,
dialog: because there's no one I'd rather
dialog: have..."
text: And that's all she can get out before falling apart. She lets
text: it out for a couple beats and then pulls herself together.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: (beat, composing herself)
dialog: "I can't talk about our love story
dialog: so instead I will talk about math.
dialog: I am not a mathematician, but I
dialog: know this: there are infinite
dialog: numbers between 0 and 1. There's .1
dialog: And .12 And .112 And an infinite
dialog: collection of others. Of course,
text: there is a bigger infinite set of
dialog: numbers between 0 and 2, or between
dialog: 0 and a million. Some infinities
dialog: are bigger than other infinities. A
dialog: writer we used to like taught us
dialog: that. I want more numbers than I'm
dialog: likely to get, and God, I want more
dialog: numbers for Augustus Waters than he
dialog: got. But, Gus, my love, I cannot
dialog: tell you how thankful I am for our
dialog: little infinity. You gave me a
dialog: forever within the numbered days,
dialog: and for that I am eternally
dialog: grateful. I love you."
text: Gus smiles, nods, and closes his eyes. CUT TO:
speaker_heading: BLACK.
text: Over which we hear a RINGING TELEPHONE.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Hazel turns on the LIGHT by her bed. Her HOUSE PHONE is
text: ringing and it's 4am.
text: She knows instantly.
dialog: 104.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: Augustus Waters died eight days
text: later in the ICU...
text: Hazel's head falls into her chest.
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: ... when the cancer, which was made
dialog: of him, stopped his heart, which
dialog: was also made of him.
text: Her bedroom door opens. It's Frannie and Michael. This only
text: confirms her worst fears. She starts to cry. Her parents
text: embrace her in the bed.
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: It was unbearable. The whole thing.
text: Every second worse than the last.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT HAZEL'S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - SAME
text: Hazel sits in the car in the dark. She's blaring the loudest
text: music she can possibly blare - a means of drowning out the
dialog: horrors of the world. Over which we hear this:
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: One of the first things they ask
dialog: you in the ER is to rate your pain
dialog: on a scale from 1 to 10. I'd been
dialog: asked this question hundreds of
dialog: times and I remember once, early
dialog: on, when I couldn't catch my breath
dialog: and it felt like my chest was on
dialog: fire, and the nurse asked me to
dialog: rate the pain and though I couldn't
dialog: speak, I held up 9 fingers.
text: The loud music isn't protecting Hazel as well as she hoped.
text: She falls apart nonetheless.
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: Later on, when I'd been feeling
dialog: better, the nurse came in and she
dialog: called me a fighter. "You know how
dialog: I know," she said. "Because you
dialog: called a ten a nine."
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - ANOTHER MORNING
text: Hazel puts on her funeral dress. She looks in the mirror.
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: But that wasn't the truth. The
dialog: reason I called it a nine was... I
dialog: was saving my ten.
dialog: 105.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT CHURCH - DAY
text: The place is filled today with mourners for Augustus Waters.
text: Hazel comes in with her parents and stands in the back,
text: watching people she's never seen before approach the Waters
text: family and extend their deepest condolences.
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: And this was it. The great and
dialog: terrible ten.
text: When Mr. and Mrs. Waters see Hazel, they open their arms.
speaker_heading: MRS. WATERS
dialog: He loved you so much.
text: Hazel nods. Hugs them back.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: He loved you so much too.
text: More MOURNERS approach the family, leaving Hazel stranded in
text: the receiving line. Her eyes turn towards the COFFIN. She's
text: not entirely sure she wants to go there but she takes a deep
text: breath, wills herself to walk towards it.
text: Gus is there in the same suit he wore to Oranjee.
text: Immediately, Hazel breaks down. And immediately, she catches
dialog: herself.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: It's ok, you hear me? It's ok.
text: She leans forward and kisses his cheek. She looks around.
text: Once in the clear, she pulls out a hard pack of Camel Lights
text: and sticks them in the space between Gus and the lining of
text: the coffin. A MINISTER approaches at that moment.
speaker_heading: MINISTER
dialog: I think we're ready to begin.
text: Hazel nods and walks back to her parents, taking her seat in
text: the middle of the room.
speaker_heading: MINISTER
dialog: Augustus Waters fought hard for
dialog: many years. His battle was a
dialog: courageous one and his strength was
dialog: a source of inspiration for each
dialog: and every one of us...
text: Hazel frowns. This is all such bullshit. And she hears:
speaker_heading: MALE VOICE
dialog: What a load of shit, eh kid?
text: Hazel recognizes that voice. But it doesn't make sense. She
text: turns around and, sure enough, it's Peter Van Houten.
dialog: 106.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MINISTER
dialog: Let us pray.
text: Everyone clasps their hands, closes their eyes. Hazel keeps
text: staring at Van Houten, too shocked to do a thing.
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN
dialog: We need to fake pray now.
text: Van Houten bows his head. Hazel, still stunned, slowly turns
text: back to the Minister, trying to make sense of this unexpected
dialog: appearance.
speaker_heading: MINISTER
dialog: Now I call on Augustus's close
text: friend Isaac to say a few words.
text: Isaac stands, walks up to the podium with someone's help.
text: Hazel sneaks one more look at Van Houten. Yup, it's really
text: him. That makes no sense to her. Isaac starts to speak.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Of all the things I've lost in my
dialog: life, this hurts the most.
text: And Isaac stops talking. It's unclear if that was the end or
text: if he just can't go on. He returns to his seat. The Minister
text: walks back up.
speaker_heading: MINISTER
dialog: And now we'll hear from Gus's...
dialog: special friend Hazel Lancaster.
text: Hazel stands, walks up to the podium. A few titters in the
text: room at the words "special friend."
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I was his girlfriend.
text: Some laughter from the crowd. She takes out her notes.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
text: There's a beautiful quote in Gus's
dialog: home that reads "if you want the
dialog: rainbow, you gotta deal with the
dialog: rain."
text: Hazel continues to speak but we over it, WE HEAR instead:
speaker_heading: HAZEL (V.O.)
dialog: I didn't believe a word, of course.
dialog: But that was ok. Funerals, I'd
dialog: decided, aren't for the dead.
dialog: They're for the living.
text: Gus's Parents, arm in arm, nod along with every word. CUT TO:
dialog: 107.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT CEMETARY - DAY
text: Everyone is watching Gus's body be lowered into the ground.
text: Everyone but Hazel. She looks off into the distance.
text: Off to the side, we see Van Houten, also not watching the
text: burial. He's watching Hazel. CUT TO:
text: LATER. Ceremony over, we see Hazel with her parents.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I'll be fine.
speaker_heading: FRANNIE
dialog: Are you sure? We can drive you --
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: No, I'd... I'd like to be alone for
dialog: a while.
text: Hazel hugs Mom and Dad, walks alone towards the parking lot.
text: As she gets to the car, Van Houten approaches.
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN
dialog: Could I hitch a ride?
dialog: Hazel doesn't want to help this man.
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN
text: Just to the bottom of the hill.
text: Hazel exhales. Fine. Once they're both in the car:
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: How did you even --
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN
dialog: The internet.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: And you just... bought a ticket?
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN
dialog: The drinks are free drinks in First
dialog: Class.
text: Van Houten removes a FLASK from his coat pocket. Takes a
text: swig. Hazel shakes her head in disgust. Starts driving.
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN
dialog: Omnis Cellula e cellula.
text: Hazel ignores him.
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN
dialog: Your boy Waters and I corresponded
dialog: quite a bit in his last --
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: You read your fan mail now?
dialog: 108.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN
dialog: I would hardly call him a fan. He
dialog: despised me. But he was quite
dialog: insistent I attend his funeral and
dialog: tell you what became of Anna and
dialog: her mother. So here I am and that's
dialog: your answer: omnis cellula e
dialog: cellula.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I'm so not in the mood --
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN
dialog: "Life comes from life."
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Goodbye Mr. Van Houten.
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN
dialog: You don't want an explanation?
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Nope. Thanks though. Have a great
dialog: life.
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN
dialog: You remind me of her.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I remind a lot of people of a lot
dialog: of people.
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN
dialog: She was eight, my daughter. She
dialog: suffered... beautifully. For so
dialog: long.
text: Hazel starts to understand Van Houten - and softens.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: She had leukemia? Like Anna?
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN
dialog: Just like her, yes.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Were you married then?
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN
dialog: Not when she died, no. I was
dialog: insufferable long before Anna, my
dialog: dear. Grief doesn't change you,
dialog: Hazel, it reveals you.
text: Hazel takes that in.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Well I'm sorry for your loss.
dialog: 109.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN
dialog: And I'm sorry for yours. I'm sorry
dialog: for everything, for being so rude
dialog: to you two, for ruining your trip --
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: You didn't ruin our trip, you
dialog: asshole. We had an awesome trip.
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN
dialog: Hazel, I'm trying. I'm trying! You
dialog: asked me to tell you what happens
dialog: and I wish I could do that. I wish
dialog: that I could. But I can't. No one
dialog: can. No one knows, Hazel. They
dialog: don't talk to us. Unless...
text: Van Houten takes out a typed piece of paper. He hands it to
text: Hazel who grabs it - and immediately crumples it into a ball.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: You think I care about that? I
dialog: don't give a shit, Van Houten.
text: Hazel throws the piece of paper at Van Houten.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: You're a drunk and a jerk and a
dialog: failure. And I'd like you to get
dialog: out of my car right now so I can go
text: home and grieve.
speaker_heading: VAN HOUTEN
speaker_heading: (STUNNED)
speaker_heading: BUT --
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Get out of the car!
text: Van Houten knows he's too late. He does as he's told,
text: stepping out of the car onto the side of the road. He stands
text: there as Hazel peels out.
text: In the rearview mirror, she sees him raise the FLASK, as if
text: toasting her. She blinks away some tears and drives. CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT HAZEL'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Hazel lies in front of the TV. "Top Model" is playing but
text: she's lost in her own world. Tears fall from her eyes and she
text: can't do anything to stop it. Hazel gets up.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Hazel sits against the tub on the floor and weeps. Soon
text: there's a knock.
dialog: 110.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAZEL
speaker_heading: (THROUGH TEARS)
dialog: Occupada.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (O.S.)
dialog: Can I come in?
text: Hazel leans over and unlocks the door. Michael kneels down
text: next to her, putting her head on his shoulder.
text: Hazel presses her face into his shirt and cries some more.
text: Michael squeezes her tightly. And this time, he doesn't cry.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I'm so so sorry.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: It was a privilege to love him,
dialog: though, wasn't it?
text: Hazel nods into his shirt. Then looks up at her Dad.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Gives you an idea how we feel about
dialog: you.
text: Michael smiles at Hazel. And he doesn't cry. Hazel draws
text: strength from him.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT ISAAC'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Hazel and Isaac have climbed through his open bedroom window.
text: They sit on the roof.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Do you know if it hurt or whatever?
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: He was really fighting for breath,
dialog: I guess. He eventually went
dialog: unconscious, but it seems like,
dialog: yeah, it wasn't great or anything.
dialog: Dying sucks.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
speaker_heading: (LONG BEAT)
dialog: It just seems so impossible.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Happens all the time.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Are you angry?
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Very.
dialog: 111.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Me too.
dialog: (a few beats)
dialog: Gus really loved you, you know.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: He wouldn't shut up about it.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: It was annoying.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I didn't find it that annoying.
text: They sit there in silence a few beats.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Did you read the note or whatever
dialog: from your author friend?
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: He is not my friend and -- how do
dialog: you know about that?
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: We talked at the cemetery. Said he
dialog: came all this way to give you that.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Yeah well I'm over it. I never want
dialog: to read another word of that
dialog: asshole's again.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Yeah but he didn't write it - Gus
dialog: did.
speaker_heading: HAZEL
speaker_heading: (STUNNED)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: That's what he said. Gus had
dialog: written something, sent it to Van
speaker_heading: HOUTEN --
text: Hazel sits up. Her heart is racing.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I... I have to go. I... Are you...?
dialog: 112.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: I do it all the time. Go.
text: As quickly as possible Hazel leaves. Isaac stays behind,
text: enjoying the cool night. A new day is coming.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT/ EXT HAZEL'S CAR - DAY
text: Hazel is inside the car, rummaging crazily through the trash
text: in an effort to find what Van Houten gave her. She's about to
text: give up when she sees it - crumpled up into a ball beneath
text: the passenger's seat. She reaches under, pulls it up, and
text: unwraps it. As she reads, WE HEAR:
speaker_heading: GUS'S VOICE
dialog: Mr. Van Houten, I'm a good person
dialog: but a shitty writer. You're a
dialog: shitty person but a good writer.
dialog: We'd make a good team. I don't want
dialog: to ask you any favors but if you
dialog: have the time, and from what I saw
dialog: you have plenty, please fix this
dialog: for me. It's a eulogy for Hazel.
text: Hazel is overcome with emotion.
speaker_heading: GUS'S VOICE
dialog: She asked me to write one and I'm
dialog: trying, I just, I could use a
dialog: little flair. See the thing is...
dialog: we all want to be remembered.
text: She smiles to herself, remembering:
dialog: - That first time Gus and Hazel ran into each other.
dialog: - The staring contest in Support Group.
speaker_heading: GUS'S VOICE
dialog: We all want to leave a mark.
text: - Driving (badly) in Gus's car.
text: - Their first kiss at the picnic by "Funky Bones."
speaker_heading: GUS'S VOICE
dialog: But not Hazel. Hazel is different.
dialog: Hazel knows the truth. She didn't
dialog: want a million admirers, she just
dialog: wanted one. And she got it. Maybe
dialog: she wasn't loved widely but she was
dialog: loved deeply. And isn't that more
dialog: than most of us get?
text: - And BACK TO HAZEL reading the letter, tears in her eyes.
speaker_heading: GUS'S VOICE
dialog: When Hazel was sick, I knew I was
dialog: dying. But I didn't want to say so.
dialog: 113.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT ICU - FLASHBACK
text: Gus stealthily sneaks into Hazel's single room in the ICU.
text: She sleeps. He kneels by her side.
speaker_heading: GUS'S VOICE
dialog: She was in ICU and I snuck in for
text: ten minutes and sat with her before
text: I got caught. Her eyes were closed,
dialog: her lungs were intubated...
text: Gus takes her hand and holds it.
speaker_heading: GUS'S VOICE
dialog: ... but her hands were still her
text: hands, still warm, and the nails
dialog: painted this dark blue back color
dialog: and I just held her hands and I
dialog: willed myself to imagine a world
dialog: without us and what a worthless
dialog: world that would be.
text: - AND BACK TO HAZEL reading the letter. She never knew that
text: story, never knew he was there. CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT HAZEL'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - LATER
text: Hazel walks out to the grass behind her house, the oxygen
text: tank dragging behind her. She lays down on the grass and
text: looks up at the stars - the same IMAGE that opened the movie.
speaker_heading: GUS'S VOICE
dialog: She's so beautiful. You don't get
dialog: tired of looking at her. You never
dialog: worry if she's smarter than you
dialog: cause you know she is. She's funny
dialog: without ever being mean.
speaker_heading: SHE REMEMBERS:
dialog: - The magical dinner at Oranjee.
text: - The bench in which they sat overlooking the water.
text: - The passionate kiss in Anne Frank's house.
text: - Falling onto the bed together.
dialog: [All of these are images we saw at the beginning of the
dialog: movie, only now, we SEE the oxygen tank, we SEE Gus's leg, we
dialog: SEE the fumbling and the difficulties etc. They don't make
text: these images less beautiful. They make them twice as
dialog: beautiful - because they're real.]
speaker_heading: GUS'S VOICE
dialog: I love her, god I love her. I'm so
dialog: lucky to love her, Van Houten.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 114.
speaker_heading: GUS'S VOICE (CONT'D)
dialog: You don't get to choose if you get
dialog: hurt in this world but you do have
dialog: a say in who hurts you.
text: - AND BACK ON Hazel in the grass. She holds the letter to her
text: chest. A single tear falls onto her cheeks.
speaker_heading: GUS'S VOICE
dialog: I like my choices. I hope she likes
dialog: hers.
text: Hazel CLOSES HER EYES.
speaker_heading: GUS'S VOICE
dialog: Ok, Hazel Grace?
text: A beat. Another.
text: Hazel OPENS HER EYES. And she says to the universe:
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Ok.
speaker_heading: BLACK.
