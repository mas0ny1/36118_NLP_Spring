scene_heading:  A JUNGLE - NIGHT

text: A BUNNY nervously walks through the dark, foreboding forest,
   frightened by every shadow and moving leaf.

speaker_heading: YOUNG JUDY (V.O.)

dialog: Fear. Treachery. Bloodlust!
          Thousands of years ago, these were
          the forces that ruled our world. A
          world where prey were scared of
          predators. And predators had an
          uncontrollable biological urge to
          maim and maul and...

text: The timpani crescendos. A JAGUAR leaps out of the shadows,
   attacks the bunny, who screams--

scene_heading:  INSIDE A BARN - A JUNGLE (SET) - NIGHT

text: The action continues-- as imagined by an amateur stage
   production.

speaker_heading: YOUNG JUDY

dialog: Blood, blood, blood!

text: Reams of red papier mâché entrails ooze from the bunny. And
   when those run out-- projectile ketchup.
   Reveal: These are ANIMAL KID ACTORS. The bunny, JUDY HOPPS,
   10, is our hero. And this is her play being staged. A banner
   reads: CARROT DAYS TALENT SHOW!

speaker_heading: YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D)

dialog: And death.

text: The CROWD looks on, confused. The music goes discordant as
   BOBBY CATMULL, a bobcat, bangs a drum.

speaker_heading: YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D)

dialog: Back then, the world was divided in
          two. Vicious predator or Meek prey.

text: TWO BOXES drop down, labeled VICIOUS PREDATOR and MEEK PREY.
The PREDATOR box lands on the jaguar. The MEEK PREY box lands
on Judy. Her entrails get stuck outside the box. She drags
them underneath with her.

speaker_heading: YOUNG JUDY (O.S.) (CONT'D)

dialog: But over time, we evolved, and
          moved beyond our primitive savage
          ways.

text: A YOUNG SHEEP wearing a white muumuu and a cardboard rainbow
on his head does an improvisational dance across the stage.
Judy and the jaguar burst out of their boxes, now wearing
white muumuus, too.

speaker_heading: YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D)

dialog: Now, predator and prey live in
          harmony.

text: Judy and the jaguar shake hands as the sheep throws glitter.

speaker_heading: YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D)

dialog: And every young mammal has
          multitudinous opportunities.

speaker_heading: ASTRONAUT SHEEP

dialog: Yeah, I don't have to cower in a
          herd anymore.

text: 
The Jaguar rips off his muumuu. She's wearing a homemade
astronaut costume.

speaker_heading: ASTRONAUT SHEEP (CONT'D)

dialog: Instead I can be an astronaut.

text: Catmull plays a slide whistle.

speaker_heading: ACTUARY JAGUAR

dialog:  I don't have to be a lonely hunter
          any more.

text: The Jaguar rips off his muumuu. He's dressed in a suit.

speaker_heading: ACTUARY

dialog: Today I can hunt for tax
          exemptions. I'm gonna be an
          actuary!

speaker_heading: YOUNG JUDY

dialog: And I can make the world a better
          place! I am going to be...

text: Catmull plays a 70s-style cop show theme on the boom box.
Judy rips off her muumuu, revealing a POLICE OFFICER UNIFORM.

speaker_heading: YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D)

dialog: A police officer!

text: Judy's parents, BONNIE &amp; STU, look stunned. A mean fox kid,
GIDEON GREY, snickers. He's sitting next to a WEASEL KID.

speaker_heading: GIDEON GREY

dialog: Bunny cop. That is the most
          stupidest thing I ever heard.

speaker_heading: YOUNG JUDY

dialog: It may seem impossible to small
          minds-- (points at Gideon)
          I'm looking at you Gideon Grey.

text: Catmull drops down a backdrop showing a bright city skyline.
He hits play on an uplifting song.

speaker_heading: YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D)

dialog: But just 211 miles away stands the
          great city of Zootopia! Where our
          ancestors first joined together in
          peace, and declared that anyone can
          be anything! Thank you and good
          night!

text: Judy gives a mighty thespian bow, to the sound of Catmull on
organ. The audience applauds. Judy's parents look concerned.

scene_heading: EXT. CARROT DAYS FESTIVAL - LATER THAT DAY

text: A festival replete with food booths, games and rides-- all
aggressively carrot-themed. Judy, in her Cop Costume, bounces
along with her folks. We catch their conversation mid-stream.

speaker_heading: STU HOPPS

dialog: Judy, you ever wonder how your mom
          and me got to be so darn happy?

speaker_heading:  YOUNG JUDY

dialog: Nope.

speaker_heading: STU HOPPS

dialog: Well, we gave up on our dreams and
          we settled, right Bon?

speaker_heading: BONNIE HOPPS

dialog: Oh yes, that's right, Stu. We
          settled hard.

speaker_heading: STU HOPPS

dialog: See, that's the beauty of
          complacency, Jude. If you don't try
          anything new, you'll never fail.

speaker_heading: YOUNG JUDY

dialog: I like trying, actually.

speaker_heading: BONNIE HOPPS

dialog: What your father means, hon, is
          it's gonna be difficult--
          impossible even-- for you to become
          a police officer.

speaker_heading: STU HOPPS

dialog:Right. There's never been a bunny
          cop.

speaker_heading: BONNIE HOPPS

dialog: No.

speaker_heading: STU HOPPS

dialog: Bunnies don't do that.

speaker_heading: BONNIE HOPPS

dialog: Never.

speaker_heading: STU HOPPS

dialog: Never.

speaker_heading: YOUNG JUDY

dialog: Oh. Then I guess I'll have to be
          the first one. Because I am gonna
          make the world...
              (parkours against a
               vendor's stand)
          A better place!

speaker_heading: STU HOPPS

dialog: OR... um, heck, you wanna talk
          about making the world a better
          place--

text: The trio arrives at the Hopps Family Farm carrot booth, which
is manned by too many children to count.

speaker_heading: STU HOPPS (CONT'D)

dialog:  --no better way to do it than
          becoming a carrot farmer.

speaker_heading: BONNIE HOPPS

dialog: Yes! Your dad, me, your 275
          brothers and sisters-- we're
          changing the world.

speaker_heading: STU HOPPS

dialog: Yep.

speaker_heading: BONNIE HOPPS

dialog: One carrot at a time...

speaker_heading: STU HOPPS

dialog: Amen to that. Carrot farming is a
          noble profession.

text: Judy spots GIDEON GREY stalking some SMALL ANIMALS. She
remains fixed on Gideon as Stu and Bonnie yap on obliviously.

speaker_heading:  BONNIE HOPPS (O.S.)

dialog: Mmm hmm. Just putting the seeds in
          the ground.

speaker_heading: STU HOPPS

dialog: Ahh, at one with the soil.

text: We're back on Bonnie and Stu's conversation now.

speaker_heading:  BONNIE HOPPS

dialog:  You get it. I mean, it's great to
          have dreams.

speaker_heading: STU HOPPS

dialog: Yeah, just as long as you don't
          believe in em too much.
              (finally noticing Judy's absence)
          Where in the heck'd she go?

text: ACROSS THE FAIR... From behind a tree, Judy watches as Gideon
Grey intimidates the astronaut sheep, SHARLA.

speaker_heading: GIDEON GREY

dialog: Gimme your tickets right now, or
          I'm gonna kick your meek little
          sheep butt.

speaker_heading: SHARLA

dialog: Ow! Cut it out, Gideon!

speaker_heading: GIDEON GREY

dialog: Baa-baa. What're ya gonna do, cry?

text: Gideon swipes Sharla's fair tickets.

speaker_heading: YOUNG JUDY (O.S.)

dialog: Hey!

text: Judy charges toward the danger.

speaker_heading: YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D)

dialog: You heard her. Cut it out.

text: Gideon turns. There's Judy, projecting the image of a tiny
Clint Eastwood.

speaker_heading: GIDEON GREY

dialog: Nice costume, loser. What crazy
          world are you living in where you
          think a bunny could be a cop?

speaker_heading: YOUNG JUDY

dialog: Kindly return my friends' tickets.

text: Gideon pats the tickets in his pocket.

speaker_heading: GIDEON GREY

dialog: Come and get `em.... But watch out,
          `cause I'm a fox-- and like you
          said in your dumb little stage
          play, us predators used to eat
          prey. And that killer instinct's
          still in our Dunnahh.

speaker_heading: TRAVIS THE WOLF HENCHMAN KID

dialog: (sotto, to Gideon)
          Uh, I'm pretty much sure it's
          pronounced D-N-A.

speaker_heading: GIDEON GREY

dialog: Don't tell me what I know, Travis.

speaker_heading: YOUNG JUDY

dialog: You don't scare me, Gideon.

text: Gideon shoves Judy. Hard. She falls. The other prey animals
flee to safety behind a nearby tree, leaving her to face the
thugs alone.

speaker_heading: GIDEON GREY

dialog: You scared now?

text: Judy starts to tear up. Her nose starts to twitch.

speaker_heading: TRAVIS THE WOLF HENCHMAN KID

dialog: Lookit her nose twitch. She is
          scared!

speaker_heading: GIDEON GREY

dialog: Cry little baby bunny. Cry, cry --

text: Suddenly-- BAM! Judy kicks Gideon in the face with her hind
legs. He stumbles back, then checks his lip for blood.

speaker_heading: GIDEON GREY (CONT'D)

dialog:    Oh, you don't know when to quit, do
          ya?

text: He unsheathes his claws like a switchblade, then slaps her,
drawing blood from her cheek. She cowers, as do her scared
friends behind the tree.

speaker_heading: GIDEON GREY (CONT'D)

dialog:  I want you to remember this moment--
          the next time you think you will
          ever be anything more than just a
          stupid, carrot farming dumb bunny.

text: Gideon and his pal head off, laughing and high-fiving. The
prey animals run back over to Judy, who wipes the blood from
her cheek. She fights tears, defeated.

speaker_heading: GARETH THE DOUBTING SHEEP BOY

dialog: That looks bad.

speaker_heading: SHARLA

dialog: Are you okay, Judy?

speaker_heading: YOUNG JUDY

dialog: Yeah... Yeah, I'm okay.

text: Judy smiles and then whips out the tickets as she gets up.

speaker_heading:  YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D)

dialog: Here you go.

speaker_heading:  SHARLA

dialog: Wow! You got our tickets!

speaker_heading: GARETH THE DOUBTING SHEEP BOY

dialog: You're awesome, Judy!

speaker_heading:  SHARLA

dialog: Yeah! That Gideon Grey doesn't know
          what he's talkin' `bout.

speaker_heading: YOUNG JUDY

dialog: Well, he was right about one
          thing...

text: Judy picks up the cop hat, puts it on her head.

speaker_heading: YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D)

dialog: I don't know when to quit.

scene_heading: EXT. POLICE ACADEMY TRAINING FACILITY - DAY

text: Hopps and the comparatively huge CADETS sit in a circle as
MAJOR FRIEDKIN, an intimidating drill instructor, lectures.

speaker_heading: MAJOR FRIEDKIN

dialog: Listen up Cadets! Zootopia has 12
          unique ecosystems within its city
          limits-- Tundra Town, Sahara
          Square, Rainforest District, to
          name a few. You're gonna have to
          master all of them before you hit
          the streets-- or guess what?
              (to Hopps)
          You'll be dead!

scene_heading:  IN SAHARA SQUARE SIMULATOR:

dialog: Scorching sandstorm. You're dead,
          bunny bumpkin!

text: ON THE VINE-COVERED MONKEY BARS:
Hopps swings across the bars, simulating the RAINFOREST
DISTRICT. She falls off, landing face first in the mud.

dialog: 1000 foot fall. You're dead, carrot
          face!

          girl!

text: IN THE BOXING RING:
Hopps gets in the ring with a BIG BISON.

speaker_heading: MAJOR FRIEDKIN (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MAJOR FRIEDKIN (CONT'D)

dialog: You're dead!

text: THREE QUICK CUTS OF FAILURE:

speaker_heading: MAJOR FRIEDKIN (O.S.) (CONT'D)

dialog: Dead! / Dead! / Dead!

text: IN THE TOILET:

txet: Hopps ruses into a stall. The toilet is considerably larger
than she is. She shuts the door. We see her climb up the
toilet. In the next stall, we see the feet of a Hippo.
Then, KERSPLASH! Hopps falls into the toilet.

speaker_heading: MAJOR FRIEDKIN (CONT'D)

dialog: Filthy toilet. You're dead, fluff
          butt!

text: HOPPS ON HER OWN--
She runs at sunset-- after everyone else has called it a day.
We HEAR the drill instructor's voice echoing in her mind.

speaker_heading: MAJOR FRIEDKIN (V.O.) (CONT'D)

dialog: Just quit and go home, fuzzy bunny!

text: Then those of her parents...

speaker_heading: STU HOPPS (V.O.)

dialog: There's never been a bunny cop.

speaker_heading: BONNIE HOPPS (V.O.)

dialog: Never.

speaker_heading: STU HOPPS (V.O.)

speaker_heading: GIDEON GREY (V.O.)

dialog: Just a stupid, carrot farming dumb
          bunny.

text: OVERNIGHT, IN THE BARRACKS:
Hopps stays up late studying, doing sit ups.
ON THE ICE WALL:
Hopps bounds up the wall, jumps off of the backs of the big
animals and makes it over, impressing the Major Friedkin.
IN THE RING:
Hopps dodges a few swings. The Bison misses. Hopps bounds
over him and uses his momentum-- kicking his other hand into
his face, knocking him down.

scene_heading: EXT. POLICE ACADEMY - DAY

speaker_heading: LIONHEART

          Assistant Mayor Bellwether? Her

in front of Bellwether, edging her out of the photo. The
flashbulbs pop.
