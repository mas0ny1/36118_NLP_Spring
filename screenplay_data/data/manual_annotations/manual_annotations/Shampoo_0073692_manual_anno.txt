scene_heading: 	DARK SCREEN - NOVEMBER 4th, 1968

text: A darkness where even outlines are not discernible. There is
	a dim point of light coming from a dot on the HI-FI which is
	PLAYING the BEACH BOYS: "When we could say good night and
	still stay together... wouldn't it be niiiice?... we could be
	married, then we could be happy, wouldn't it be niiiiice?"
		Through it there has been the SOUND of BANGING, distinct and
	rhythmic. It GROWS LOUDER as the MUSIC ENDS. There are also
	WHIMPERING SOUNDS from a woman.

speaker_heading:   FELICIA'S VOICE

dialog: Oh, no.

speaker_heading: GEORGE'S VOICE

dialog: 	     ... what?...

speaker_heading:   FELICIA'S VOICE

dialog: That headboard.

speaker_heading: GEORGE'S VOICE

dialog: Nobody can hear it.

text: It BANGS a couple of more times.

speaker_heading:   FELICIA'S VOICE

dialog: I can. It makes me nervous.

text: It continues to bang until Felicia screams, over the banging
	of the headboard. She follows the scream with a few yelps.
	Silence. Now the SOUND of the PHONE RINGING.

speaker_heading:   FELICIA'S VOICE (CONT'D)

dialog:  (complimentary)
	     Oh my God... Jesus... Jesus
	     Christ... Jesus H. Christ.

speaker_heading:   FELICIA'S VOICE (CONT'D)

	          tone)
	     You going to answer it?

speaker_heading: GEORGE'S VOICE

dialog:  (meaning no)
	     Uh-uh.

text: It CONTINUES TO RING.

speaker_heading:   FELICIA'S VOICE 

dialog: (being for her very
	          mischievous)
	     Want me to?

speaker_heading: GEORGE'S VOICE

dialog: Let it ring.

text: And it does. It CONTINUES TO RING, killing all other
	considerations.

speaker_heading:   FELICIA'S VOICE 

dialog: Boy, whoever she is, she doesn't
	     give up.

text: After a moment's fumbling, George finally picks it up.

speaker_heading: GEORGE'S VOICE

dialog:  Hello...
	          (a little surprised)
	     Ah, hi.

text: 	The GIRL'S VOICE on the other end of the phone can be HEARD
	only FITFULLY, when George holds the receiver loosely by his
	ear. It is TINA.

speaker_heading:  TINA'S VOICE

dialog: What took you so long?

speaker_heading: GEORGE'S VOICE

dialog: Wasn't sure it was you.

speaker_heading:  TINA'S VOICE

dialog:    (muffled)

speaker_heading: GEORGE'S VOICE

dialog:   I... uh... I... uh... can't.

speaker_heading:  TINA'S VOICE

dialog:  (laughter, sizing it up
	          immediately)
	     All right, who're you with? Jill?

speaker_heading: GEORGE'S VOICE

speaker_heading:  TINA'S VOICE

speaker_heading: GEORGE'S VOICE

dialog:          (to Tina)
	     Okay, okay...

text: 	He hangs up. Felicia has fished for a cigarette, lit it and
	coughed.

speaker_heading:  FELICIA'S VOICE

	     rude.

	     phone.
