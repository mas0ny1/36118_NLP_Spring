scene_heading: EXT. MARIGOLD PATH - DUSK

text: A path of marigold petals leads up to an altar lovingly
      arranged in a humble cemetery. An old woman lights a candle
      as the smoke of burning copal wood dances lyrically upward...
	The smoke lifts up toward lines of papel picado ­- cut paper
      banners -- that sway gently in the breeze.

speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O.)

dialog: Sometimes I think I'm cursed...
                  'cause of something that happened
                  before I was even born.

text: A story begins to play out on the papel picado.

speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O.)

dialog: See, a long time ago there was this
                  family.

text: The images on the papel picado come to life to illustrate a
      father, a mother, and a little girl. The family is happy.

speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O.)

dialog: The papá, he was a musician.

text: The papá plays guitar while the mother dances with her
      daughter.

speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O.) 

dialog: He and his family would sing, and
                  dance, and count their blessings...
                      (beat)
                  But he also had a dream... to play
                  for the world.
                      (beat)
                  And one day he left with his
                  guitar... and never returned.

text:  The man walks down a road, guitar slung on his back. In
      another vignette his daughter stands in the doorway, watching
      her papá leave. Two feet step up next to her. It is her
      mamá, hardened. She shuts the door.

speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O.) 

dialog: And the mamá...? She didn't have
                  time to cry over that walkaway
                  musician!
                      (beat)
                  After banishing all music from her
                  life...

text: The woman gets rid of all of her husband's instruments and
      records.

speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O.) 

dialog: She found a way to provide for her
                  daughter...
                      (beat)
                  She rolled up her sleeves and she
                  learned to make shoes.
                      (beat)
                  She could have made candy!

text: Amongst the papel picado, a stick swings at a strung up
      piñata which bursts with candy...

speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O.) 

dialog: Or fireworks!

text: Fireworks go off in the background...

speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O.) 

dialog: Or sparkly underwear for wrestlers!

text: Sparkly underwear and a luchador mask hang on a line amongst
      other linens...

speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O.) 

dialog: But no... she chose shoes...

text: On the papel picado, the little girl becomes a young woman.

speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O.) 

dialog: Then she taught her daughter to
                  make shoes. And later, she taught
                  her son-in-law.

text: She introduces a suitor to the family business.

speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O.) 

dialog:          Then her grandkids got roped in.
                  As her family grew, so did the
                  business.

text: In the next vignette, a bunch of goofy grandchildren join in
      the shoemaking. The shoe shop is full of family!

speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O.) 

dialog: Music had torn her family apart,
                  but shoes held them all together.
                      (beat)
                  You see, that woman was my great-
                  great grandmother, Mamá Imelda.

scene_heading: OFRENDA ROOM - DAY

text: where a photo sits at the top of a beautiful altar. The
      photo features MAMÁ IMELDA -- serious, formidable. She holds
      a baby on her lap. Her husband stands beside her, but his
      face has been torn away.

speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O.) 

dialog: She died WAY before I was born.
                  But my family still tells her story
                  every year on Día de los Muertos --
                  the Day of the Dead...
                      (beat)
                  And her little girl?

text: Fade from the face of the little girl to present day MAMÁ
      COCO (97), a living raisin, convalescing in a wicker
      wheelchair.

speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O.) 

dialog: She's my great grandmother, Mamá
                  Coco.

      This is our narrator, MIGUEL.

speaker_heading: MIGUEL

dialog: Holá, Mamá Coco.

speaker_heading: MAMÁ COCO

dialog: How are you, Julio?

speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O.)

dialog: Actually, my name is Miguel. Mamá
                  Coco has trouble remembering
                  things... But it's good to talk to
                  her anyway. So I tell her pretty
                  much everything.

scene_heading: EXT. COURTYARD

speaker_heading: MIGUEL

dialog: I used to run like this...

text: Miguel pumps his arms with his hands in fists. Then he
      switches to flat palms.

speaker_heading: MIGUEL

dialog: But now I run like this which is
                  way faster!

scene_heading: INT. MAMÁ COCO'S ROOM

text: Miguel, in a luchador mask, climbs onto the bed, arms raised.

speaker_heading: MIGUEL

dialog:  And the winner is... Luchadora
                  Coco!

text: Miguel leans toward Mamá Coco at the dinner table.

speaker_heading: MIGUEL

dialog: I have a dimple on this side, but
                  not on this side. Dimple. No
                  dimple. Dimple. No dimple--

speaker_heading: ABUELITA

dialog: Miguel!   Eat your food.

text: Miguel's ABUELITA (70s) runs the table like a ship captain.
      She gives Mamá Coco a kiss on the head.

speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O.)

dialog: My Abuelita? She's Mamá Coco's
                  daughter.

txet: Abuelita piles extra tamales on Miguel's plate.

speaker_heading: ABUELITA

dialog:     Aw, you're a twig, mijo.         Have some
                  more.

speaker_heading: MIGUEL 

dialog: No, gracias.

speaker_heading: ABUELITA

dialog:  I asked if you would like more
                  tamales.

speaker_heading: MIGUEL 

dialog: S-sí?

speaker_heading: ABUELITA

dialog: That's what I THOUGHT you said.

speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O.)

dialog: Abuelita runs our house just like
                  Mamá Imelda did.

scene_heading: INT. OFRENDA ROOM - DAY

text: Abuelita adjusts the photo of her beloved Mamá Imelda. Then
      she perks her ear at a hooting sound.

scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

text:   Miguel idly blows into a glass soda bottle.     Abuelita takes
      the bottle away.

speaker_heading: ABUELITA

dialog: No music!

scene_heading: INT. MAMÁ COCO'S ROOM - DAY

      tunes. Abuelita angrily slams the window shut.

speaker_heading: ABUELITA

dialog: No music!!

scene_heading: EXT. STREET - EVENING

dialog:  (singing) AUNQUE LA VIDA--

text: Abuelita bursts out of the gate and chases them away.

speaker_heading: ABUELITA

dialog: NO MUSIC!!!

speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O)

                  México who hates music...

scene_heading: INT. RIVERA WORKSHOP - DAY

text: We see the Rivera family tinkering in the shoe shop, no music
      to be heard. Miguel jogs past them.

speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O)

dialog: And my family's fine with that...

text: He grabs his shine box, and heads out of the shoe shop.

speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O)

dialog: But me?

speaker_heading: MAMÁ

dialog: Be back by lunch, mijo!

speaker_heading: MIGUEL 

dialog: Love you, Mamá!

scene_heading:  SANTA CECILIA - MORNING

speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O)

dialog: I am NOT like the rest of my
                  family...

text: He passes a woman sweeping a stoop.

speaker_heading: WOMAN

dialog: Hola, Miguel!

speaker_heading: MIGUEL

dialog: Hola!

text: He passes a band of musicians playing a tune. Miguel joins
      with some air guitar and the further down the street he goes,
      the more instruments and sounds layer in. The bells of the
      church chime in harmony, a radio blares a cumbia rhythm.
 Running past a food stand, Miguel grabs a roll of pan dulce
      and tosses the vendor a coin.

speaker_heading: MIGUEL

dialog: Muchas gracias!

speaker_heading: STREET VENDOR

dialog: De nada, Miguel!

text: As Miguel passes all these scenes, the music synthesizes and
      he can't help but tap out rhythms along a table of alebrijes.
      The fantastical wooden animal sculptures each play a
      different tone like a marimba. Miguel finishes with a SMACK
      on a trash can, out of which a pops up a scrappy hairless
      Xolo dog. The dog, DANTE, barks and jumps up to lick Miguel,
      who laughs.

speaker_heading: MIGUEL

dialog: Hey, hey!    Dante!

text: Miguel holds the pan dulce over Dante's head.

speaker_heading: MIGUEL

dialog:  Sit. Down. Roll over.        Shake.
                  Fist bump.

text: Dante obeys to the best of his ability.

speaker_heading: MIGUEL

dialog: Good boy, Dante!

text: Miguel tosses the pan dulce to his furless friend who topples
      back into the trash can.

scene_heading: MARIACHI PLAZA - MOMENTS LATER

text: Miguel rounds the corner toward the town square. Vendors
      sell sugar skulls and marigolds, and musicians fill the
      square with music.

speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O)

dialog: I know I'm not supposed to love
                  music -- but it's not my fault!
                      (beat)
                  It's his: Ernesto de la Cruz...

text: Miguel approaches a statue of a handsome mariachi at the
      heart of the plaza.

speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O)

dialog: ...The greatest musician of all
                  time.

text: A tour group and their TOUR GUIDE are gathered around the
      base of the statue.

speaker_heading: TOUR GUIDE

dialog: And right here, in this very plaza,
                  the young Ernesto de la Cruz took
                  his first steps toward becoming the
                  most beloved singer in Mexican
                  history!

text: CLIPS of de la Cruz in his hay day: playing as a young man in
      the plaza, serenading bystanders in a train car...

speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O)

dialog: He started out a total nobody from
                  Santa Cecilia, like me. But when
                  he played music, he made people
                  fall in love with him.

text: MORE CLIPS from de la Cruz's films. He leaps from a tree
      branch onto a galloping horse. He plays his signature skull
      guitar with flourish and flair.

speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O)

dialog: He starred in movies. He had the
                  coolest guitar... He could fly!

text: A CLIP features de la Cruz dressed as a hovering priest, held
      up by strings, in front of a cycling sky flat.

speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O)

dialog: And he wrote the best songs! But
                  my all-time favorite? It's--

text: A CLIP of de la Cruz performing in a fancy nightclub.

speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ

dialog: (singing)
                 REMEMBER ME
                  THOUGH I HAVE TO SAY GOODBYE
                  REMEMBER ME
                  DON'T LET IT MAKE YOU CRY
                  FOR EVEN IF I'M FAR AWAY
                  I HOLD YOU IN MY HEART
                  I SING A SECRET SONG TO YOU
                  EACH NIGHT WE ARE APART
                  REMEMBER ME
			 (MORE)

speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ (CONT'D)

dialog: THOUGH I HAVE TO TRAVEL FAR
                  REMEMBER ME
                  EACH TIME YOU HEAR A SAD GUITAR
                  KNOW THAT I'M WITH YOU THE ONLY WAY
                  THAT I CAN BE...

speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O)

dialog: He lived the kind of life you dream
                  about... Until 1942...

text: As the audience swoons over de la Cruz, an absent-minded
      stagehand leans on a lever. Ropes and pulleys go flying.

speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ

dialog:         UNTIL YOU'RE IN MY ARMS AGAIN
                  REMEMBER ME!

text: De la Cruz is subsequently crushed by a giant bell.

speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O)

dialog: I wanna be just like him.

scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY - MOMENTS LATER

text:       Miguel weaves up to de la Cruz's mausoleum and peeks in the
      window. He catches a glimpse of de la Cruz's signature skull
      guitar.

speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O)

dialog:  Sometimes, I look at de la Cruz and
                  I get this feeling... like we're
                  connected somehow. Like, if HE
                  could play music, maybe someday I
                  could too...

scene_heading:  EXT. MARIACHI PLAZA - DAY

speaker_heading: MIGUEL (CONT'D)

dialog: ...If it wasn't for my family.

speaker_heading: PLAZA MARIACHI

dialog: (playful)
                  Ay, ay, ay, muchacho.

speaker_heading: MIGUEL

dialog: Huh?

speaker_heading: PLAZA MARIACHI

dialog: I asked for a shoe shine, not your
                  life story.

text: Miguel comes out of his reverie and looks up at the PLAZA
      MARIACHI whose shoes he is shining.

speaker_heading: MIGUEL

dialog: Oh, yeah, sorry.

text: He goes back to scrubbing the man's shoe.    As Miguel shines,
      the mariachi plucks his guitar idly.

speaker_heading: MIGUEL

dialog:  I just can't really talk about any
                  of this at home so...

speaker_heading: PLAZA MARIACHI

dialog: Look, if I were you I'd march right
                  up to my family and say, "Hey! I'm
                  a musician. Deal with it!"

speaker_heading: MIGUEL

dialog: I could never say that...

speaker_heading: PLAZA MARIACHI

dialog: You ARE a musician, no?

speaker_heading: MIGUEL

dialog: I don't know. I mean... I only
                  really play for myself--

speaker_heading: PLAZA MARIACHI

dialog: Did de la Cruz become the world's
                  best musician by hiding his sweet,
                  sweet skills? No! He walked out
                  onto that plaza and he played out
                  loud!

text: The mariachi gets an idea. He points to the gazebo where
      organizers are setting up for a show. They unfurl a canvas
      poster which reads "TALENT SHOW."

speaker_heading: PLAZA MARIACHI (CONT'D)

dialog: Ah, mira, mira! They're setting up
                  for tonight. The music competition
                  for Día de Muertos. You wanna be
                  like your hero? You should sign
                  up!

speaker_heading: MIGUEL

dialog: Uh-uh, my family would freak!

speaker_heading: PLAZA MARIACHI

dialog: Look, if you're too scared, then,
                  well... have fun making shoes.

text: Miguel considers this.

speaker_heading: PLAZA MARIACHI (CONT'D)

dialog: C'mon.    What did de la Cruz always
                  say?

speaker_heading: MIGUEL

dialog: ...Seize your moment?

text: The mariachi appraises Miguel, then offers his guitar.

speaker_heading: PLAZA MARIACHI

dialog:  Show me what you got, muchacho.
                  I'll be your first audience.

text: Miguel's brows rise, surprised. He reaches to take the
      instrument, regarding it as if holding a holy relic.
      Miguel spreads his fingers across the strings anticipating
      his chord and...

speaker_heading: ABUELITA (O.S.)

dialog: MIGUEL!

text: Startled, Miguel impulsively throws the guitar back onto the
      mariachi's lap. He turns to see Abuelita marching toward
      him. Miguel's TÍO BERTO (40s) and PRIMA ROSA (16), follow
      with supplies from the market.

speaker_heading: MIGUEL

dialog: Abuelita!

speaker_heading: ABUELITA

dialog: What are you doing here?

speaker_heading: MIGUEL

dialog: Um...uh...

text: Miguel quickly packs away his shine rag and polishes.
      Abuelita barrels up to the mariachi.
      She hits his hat with her shoe and waves him away.

speaker_heading: ABUELITA

dialog: You leave my grandson alone!

speaker_heading: PLAZA MARIACHI

dialog: Doña, please -- I was just getting
                  a shine!

speaker_heading: ABUELITA

dialog: I know your tricks, mariachi!
                      (to Miguel)
                  What did he say to you?

speaker_heading: MIGUEL

dialog:   He was just showing me his
                  guitar...

text: Gasps from the family.

speaker_heading: TÍO BERTO

dialog: Shame on you!

text: Abuelita lords over the mariachi, shoe aimed directly between
      his eyes.

speaker_heading: ABUELITA

dialog: My grandson is a sweet little
                  angelito querido cielito -- he
                  wants no part of your music,
                  mariachi! You keep away from him!

text: The mariachi scrambles away, snatching his hat off the
      ground before he goes. Abuelita hugs Miguel protectively to
      her bosom.

speaker_heading: ABUELITA

dialog: Ay, pobrecito! Estás bien, mijo?

text:       She peppers him with kisses then releases him from the
      embrace. He gasps for air.

speaker_heading: ABUELITA

dialog:  (distressed)
                  You know better than to be here in
                  this place! You will come home.
                  Now.

text: Abuelita turns toward home. Miguel sighs and gathers his
      shine box. Then, seeing a flyer for the plaza "TALENT SHOW",
      he can't help but pocket it. He follows Abuelita.
