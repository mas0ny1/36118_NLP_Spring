dialog:  What you are now witnessing is
                    footage never before seen by
                    civilized humanity: a lost world in
                    South America! Lurking in the
                    shadow of majestic Paradise Falls,
                    it sports plants and animals
                    undiscovered by science. Who would
                    dare set foot on this inhospitable
                    summit?

text: Of everyone watching in the modest, small town theater, no
          one is more enthralled than 8 year old CARL FREDRICKSEN.

speaker_heading: NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

dialog: This lighter-than-air craft was
                    designed by Muntz himself, and is
                    longer than 22 Prohibition paddy-
                    wagons placed end to end.

text:  Young Carl stares, mouth agape, wearing leather flight helmet
          and goggles -- just like his idol on the silver screen.

                    Muntz conceived the craft for
                    canine comfort! It's a veritable
                    floating palace in the sky...

                    mechanical canine walker.

text:   One dog runs suffers through mechanized bath time, while a
          second wears an electrode helmet and runs on a treadmill.

speaker_heading: NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

dialog: And Jiminy Cricket, do the locals
                    consider Muntz the bee's knees!
                    And how!

text: Cameras flash as Muntz stands heroic, striking his signature
          "thumbs up" stance.

                    this time?

          curtained object.

speaker_heading: MUNTZ

                    this is. But what's this?

speaker_heading: NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

dialog: Scientists cry foul! The National
                    Explorers Society accuses Muntz of
                    fabricating the skeleton!

speaker_heading: YOUNG CARL

dialog:  No!

text: Muntz's portrait is removed from a wall of paintings of other
          famous explorers.

speaker_heading: NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

dialog:  The organization strips Muntz of
                    his membership.

text:    Muntz's "Explorer's Society" badge is ceremoniously RIPPED
          from his jacket.
          Carl GASPS.
Muntz stands next to his dirigible at an airfield.       He grimly
          addresses the crowd.

speaker_heading: NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

dialog: Humiliated, Muntz vows a return to
                    Paradise Falls and promises to
                    capture the beast... alive!

speaker_heading: MUNTZ

dialog: I promise to capture the beast...
                    alive!

text: In the theater, young Carl smiles.

speaker_heading: MUNTZ

dialog:                     And I will not come back until I do!

text: The crowd CHEERS. 
         Muntz gives his thumbs up from the cockpit as the dirigible
          lifts off.

speaker_heading: NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

dialog:  And so the    explorer is off to clear
                    his name.     Bon voyage Charles
                    Muntz, and    good luck capturing the
                    Monster of    Paradise Falls!

text: Carl looks like he just witnessed a miracle.
