             AN ARM
             stretched out.  Long, alabaster white.  Beautiful.  A WASH
             CLOTH enters frame.  Starts washing the arm with long, tender
             strokes. 
             A TUMBLE OF HAIR 
            thick and auburn.  Being gently washed.  
             FINGERNAILS
             being clipped with a shiny nail clipper.  Short.  Uniform.
             Tidy.
             EYEBROWS
             brown with a touch of gold.  A BRUSH comes into view.
             Brushes against the eyebrow hair, then back again.  Against.
             Then back again.
             PANTY-HOSE
             pulled gingerly off a long leg.  Folded neatly.  The wash
             cloth begins between the toes.  Warm, soapy water.
             HAIR
             now dry.  The HAND appears with a comb.  Pulls down through
             the thick tresses.
             It is only now that we see the hand is wearing a SURGICAL
             GLOVE.
             The gloved hand holds up the comb and pulls stray hairs from
             it.  Places them in a big, clear, plastic bag.  In the bag we
             see the panty-hose, a folded flower dress, the nail
             clippings.
             Goes back to combing.  Comes across a knot and yanks the comb
             through.  The HEAD rolls over to us.  Her face is bruised,
             her eyes blank.  She is lying on the floor.
             Dead.
             End of credit sequence.

scene_heading:              INT. BUSH PLANE - THE KILBUCK MOUNTAINS, ALASKA - DAY

text: The loud THRUM of a bush plane.  We CLOSE ON a small, cloudy
             window.  Through it we see an endless expanse of pine trees.

speaker_heading:   HAP (O.S.)

dialog: Jesus.  Just look at all that.

text:  PULL BACK to reveal HAP ECKHART and WILL DORMER sitting side
             by side.  Hap's at the window.  Greying moustache, a little
             pudgy, wearing a brown suit.  Holding a folded over Seattle
             Times.

speaker_heading:   HAP (cont'd)

dialog:  I thought we had a population problem.
                       Everyone should just move up here.
                           (taps window)
                       Just look at it, Will.

text:   Will's eyes remain on the file on his lap.

speaker_heading:  WILL

dialog: I don't need to look at it.

text: Will Dormer.  Tall, handsome, expensively tailored suit.
             Snakeskin cowboy boots.  There's both a magnetism and a
             distance to him.  An intense mixture.  Hap glances at him.

speaker_heading:   HAP

dialog: Nothing wrong with smelling the roses.

text: Will looks up.  We see the trace of a thick, ropy SCAR by his
             Adam's apple.  There's tension between him and Hap, just
             below the surface.  He taps the file.

speaker_heading:  WILL

dialog:   Tell that to her, partner.

text: ANGLE ON THE FILE
             a stack of 8x10 PHOTOGRAPHS.  Of the dead girl.  Her eyes
             puffed up from bruises.  The whites bloody.  Contusions along
             her breasts and shoulders.

speaker_heading:  PILOT (O.S.)

dialog: Detective?

text:  The PILOT's looking back at Will.  Wearing a leather red
             baron hat.

speaker_heading: PILOT (cont'd)

dialog:  Better check your belts.  We'll be
                       landing in about fifteen minutes.

text: Will nods.  The plane lurches.  The file falls to the floor
             and the photographs scatter.  The pilot catches a glimpse of
             them.  Looks at Will.

scene_heading:              EXT. BUSH PLANE - CONTINUOUS

text:  The small yellow plane veers left.  Clears a mountain top and
             gives view to the spectacular Alaskan coastline.  The green
             of the Bering sea, the blanket of pine trees, the jagged rock
             of the beaches.  Enormous.

scene_heading:  EXT. LANDING STRIP - OUTSIDE NIGHTMUTE - DAY

text:  A SIGN swinging in the wind: Nightmute, Alaska.  Halibut
             Fishing Capital of the World!
             PULL BACK to reveal it hanging from the eave of a small,
             corrugated building.  The "airport."  Nothing else for miles
             around.
             A mud-splattered Jeep Cherokee pulls up next to it.  Brakes
             SCREECHING.  A YOUNG WOMAN hops out.  About 23.  Petite with
             short, brown hair.
             Peers up at the sky.  Brightens at the sight of the BUSH
             PLANE coming in for landing.  Smooths down her down vest.
             Making sure the GOLD SHIELD on her belt's visible.  Nervous.
             Excited.

speaker_heading:  OLD MAN (O.S.)

dialog:        Eleanor?

text:   ELLIE BURR turns.  Shields her eyes from the sun.  An OLD MAN
             hosing down the side of the building.

speaker_heading: ELLIE

dialog: Hey, Mr. Angstrom!
