scene_heading: INT. SUNNY HOUSE - DAY 1

text: A spacious 2nd floor of faux paint and crushed sea shells.
A TV REMOTE with a shit-ton of buttons. Behind it, a FLAT-
SCREEN squawks to an empty room.
A SNACK PLATE and EMPTY CUP sit atop a kitchen island.
PUSHING PAST a BIN of CHILDREN’S TOYS, down a hallway filling
with STEAM...

scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - SUNNY HOUSE - DAY 2

text: THE STEAM swirls around the spa-like interior.
A PLASTIC COMB rests between HIS AND HER SINKS, under EMPTY
TOWEL RACKS.
Buried within the aquatic echo-chamber, FAINT CRUNCHING.
The faucet SQUEAKS OFF.
DRIPS resonate from behind the shower curtain. Through a
cracked window, an OCEAN BREEZE swallows the steam. A CAR
STEREO attacks and decays. Then quiet.
The shower SQUEAKS ON and the STEAM retakes the room.
ANOTHER NOISE. The water SQUEAKS OFF and the shower curtain
yanks back, revealing a BEARDED MAN (36) with sun-baked skin,
alarmed but motionless.
Muffled, through walls: TIRES ON GRAVEL. THE THUMP OF CAR
DOORS.
ON THE BEARDED MAN: FIGHT-OR-FLIGHT...

scene_heading: INT. FOYER - SUNNY HOUSE - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 3

text: A FAMILY spills through the door (FATHER, MOTHER, weighed
down with GROCERIES and TWO YOUNG DAUGHTERS running wild)- a
wonderful cacophony disrupting the quiet.

text: The FATHER places REALTOR’S HOUSE KEYS on the island counter,
beside the SNACK PLATE...

text: The WIFE turns from the THERMOSTAT and hushes the kids.
The TV IS AUDIBLE.
The Father sidesteps into the hallway, seeing DISSIPATING
STEAM DRIFT FROM THE BATHROOM.

speaker_heading: FATHER (CONT'D)

dialog: Honey. AMANDA. Take them back to
the car. Call 911.

text: The Wife corrals the girls as the Father DRAWS FROM A WOODEN
KNIFE BLOCK SET, creeping down the hallway...

Eric! What are you doing?

speaker_heading: FATHER

dialog: (bluffing a threat)
I'VE GOT A DOG!

speaker_heading: DAUGHTER (0.S.)

dialog: There’s a dog?!

text: Nearing the bathroom threshold, the Father tightens a two-
handed grip around his weapon, realizing he’s selected a
ROUNDED STEEL SHARPENER from the knife block.
HE SLIPS TO THE HARD WOOD FLOOR, landing torso upright with a
SHARP BREATH.
A Daughter breaks free as the Mother fumbles her purse.
The Father’s lower vantage reveals A TRAIL OF WET FOOTPRINTS
LEADING TO THE BACK OF THE HOUSE.
His daughter runs past GIGGLING, following the footprints.

dialog: ELLA! NO! Dammit...

and pokes her head through an open window.

ON THE WINDOW: The daughter watches nonchalantly until her
father scoops her up.

scene_heading: EXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY 7

text: Obscured through CLOTHESLINES and fencing, the Bearded Man
jogs to a stop and steps into his worn khakis.
CLACK.
He squats and rises, inspecting his PLASTIC COMB, now
speckled with sand. He blows it clean.

scene_heading: EXT. STREET - BEACH BLOCK - DAY 8

text: Dressed but damp, the Bearded Man drips a trail up the sandy
walkway, anxiously combing his hair. He moves against beach
traffic past modern condos, older bungalows and monstrous
resort homes.

scene_heading: EXT. MAIN DRAG - DAY 9

text: The Bearded Man sheaths his comb and turns down a walkway
leading to a SMALL TOWN POLICE STATION.

scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - DAY 10

text: The Bearded Man opens the door for an exiting PATROL OFFICER,
returning a nod and weaving his way past RECEPTION to a
FEMALE OFFICER (55) eating an egg sandwich at her desk.

of her sandwich. The Bearded Man shakes ‘no’.

There was a kid. Kids.

speaker_heading: BEARDED MAN

speaker_heading: FEMALE OFFICER

thousand a week.
