scene_heading: INT.  CONCOURSE/AIRPORT TERMINAL - BAY

text: CLOSE ON A FACE.  A nine year old boy, YOUNG COLE, his eyes wide
	with wonder. watching something intently.  We HEAR the sounds of
	the P.A. SYSTEM droning Flight Information mingled with the
	sounds of urgent SHOUTS, running FEET, EXCLAMATIONS.
	YOUNG COLE'S POV:  twenty yards away, a BLONDE MAN is sprawled on
	the floor, blood oozing from his gaudy Hawaiian shirt.
	A BRUNETTE in a tight dress, her face obscured from YOUNG COLE'S
	view, rushes to the injured man, kneels beside him, ministering
	to his wound.
	ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, flanked by his PARENTS, their faces out of
	view, as they steer him away.

speaker_heading: FATHER'S VOICE (o.s.)

dialog: Come on, Son --this is no place for us.

text: YOUNG COLE resists momentarily, mesmerized by the drama.
	YOUNG COLE'S POV:  intermittently visible through a confusion of
	FIGURES rushing through the foreground, the BLONDE MAN reaching
	up and touching the cheek of the kneeling BRUNETTE in a gesture
	of enormous tenderness, a gesture of farewell, while the P.A.
	SYSTEM continues its monotonous monotone...

speaker_heading: P.A. SYSTEM

dialog: Flight 784 for San Francisco is now
		ready for boarding at inmate number
		66578, Greely.

scene_heading: INT.  PRISON DORMITORY/FUTURE - ETERNAL NIGHT

speaker_heading: PRISON P.A. SYSTEM

dialog: --number 5429, Garcia -- number 87645, Cole...

text: COLE, late thirties, dark hair, comes awake in a bunk cage, one
	of many stacked four high along both sides of a long dim
	corridor.  He blinks in the near dark, shaken, disoriented.
	Then, as he "recovers" from his very vivid dream, WE GET OUR
	FIRST LOOK AT HIS ENVIRONMENT...A WINDOWLESS UNDERGROUND WORLD OF
	ETERNAL NIGHT SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE...AN ALMOST COLORLESS
	"REALITY" OF BLURRED EDGES AND ECHOEY SOUNDS, MUCH MORE
	"DREAMLIKE" THAN HIS DREAM.
	Flashlights glare. In the half-light, COLE sees spooky figures,
	GUARDS, moving among the locked bunk/cages.
	COLE turns and whispers to the occupant of the next cage, JOSE...

speaker_heading: COLE

dialog: Ssssst!  Jose, what's going on?

text: JOSE's face is almost lost in shadow.  What there is of it is
	youthful.  He's just a scared Puerto Rican kid!

speaker_heading: JOSE

dialog: "Volunteers" again.

text: JOSE immediately rolls over and feigns sleep as SCARFACE, a
	menacing guard with a jagged scar running down his cheek, looms
	close to COLE's cage and unlocks it.

speaker_heading: SCARFACE

dialog: "Volunteer duty".

text: The PRISONERS in the other cages watch silently with narrowed eyes.

speaker_heading: COLE

dialog: I didn't volunteer.

speaker_heading: SCARFACE

dialog: You causing trouble again?

speaker_heading: COLE

dialog: (controls his temper)
		No trouble.

scene_heading: INT.  EQUIPMENT ROOM - ETERNAL NIGHT

text: COLE's alone, struggling to get into what looks like a space suit
	in a room where suits hang like ghosts with blank eyes.

scene_heading: TITLES BEGIN SUPERED OVER THE SCENE

text: COLE has the torso of the suit on now and is trying to close it.

speaker_heading: OFFSCREEN VOICE (o.s.)

dialog: All openings must be closed.

text: COLE looks for the source of the voice, a tiny grate in the wall.

speaker_heading: OFFSCREEN VOICE (o.s.)

dialog: If the integrity of the suit is compromised
		in any way, if the fabric is torn or a zipper
		not closed, readmittance will be denied.

scene_heading: INT.  SEALED CHAMBER - MINUTES LATER (ETERNAL NIGHT)

text: COLE, wearing the "space suit" and a helmet with a plastic visor,
	steps into a tiny chamber, a kind of air lock.  The heavy door
	clangs shut behind him.  He's alone.  COLE'S breath comes quicker
	now as he sucks oxygen from the air tanks on his back.
	On the opposite wall is another door with a huge wheel lock.
	COLE turns the heavy wheel, opens the door, steps through It

scene_heading: INT.  ELEVATOR - SECONDS LATER (ETERNAL NIGHT)

text: COLE'S in an ascending elevator that groans and creaks.  He looks
	down at a crudely drawn map he holds in his gloved hand.
	The map shows a series of tunnels and ladders.

scene_heading: INT.  SEWER PIPE - MINUTES LATER (NIGHT)

text: COLE pans a flashlight, probing the filthy sewer he's wading through RATS flee the blade of light, scurry across islands of rusting junk.
	The flashlight beam settles on a ladder mounted in the wall.
	Reaching the rusted ladder, COLE starts to climb awkwardly.

scene_heading: EXT.  CITY STREET/FUTURE - MOMENTS LATER (NIGHT)

text: A SCRAPING NOISE as a heavy man-hole cover is pushed up and moved
	aside.  COLE'S helmeted head emerges from below.
	COLE'S POV THROUGH HIS PLASTIC-VISORED HELMET:  a city in
	moonlight!  A surreal image of abandoned buildings.  No people
	anywhere.  The only sounds are the WIND and COLE'S BREATHING.

scene_heading: EXT.  ANOTHER CITY STREET - MINUTES LATER (NIGHT)

text: COLE'S light reveals abandoned vine-covered automobiles.	
	Moving to the nearest car, COLE searches in the vines for
	something.  Finds it.  An insect.
	COLE takes the bug in his gloved hand.  As he clumsily inserts it
	into a collection tube, something makes him turn.
	There's something across the street in the dark.  Something alive.
	COLE points his flashlight and reveals...a BEAR!  Startled by the
	light, the animal blinks, then stands on its rear legs and ROARS.
	ANGLE ON COLE, staring wide-eyed.
	Then, the BEAR sinks down onto all fours and, trying to avoid the
	flashlight, it pads quickly down the street.

scene_heading: INT.  SUBTERRANEAN PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

text: Using the flashlight to see, COLE reaches down to the cracked
	floor and gets another specimen.  DOGSHIT!
	The only sound is COLE'S labored BREATHING.
	Then, a different SOUND.  GRRRR!  A dog.  More GRRRRS.  More
	dogs.  Then, a YIP.  Then, VICIOUS GROWLS.  It's a DOGFIGHT!

scene_heading: EXT.  STREET - NIGHT (FIRST LIGHT)

text: A giant OWL, perched on an overhead traffic light, raises its wings
	and lifts off...rising higher and higher into the brightening sky.
	Below, on the street, COLE trudges along, passing deserted
	buildings, windows broken, rusted signs dangling.

scene_heading: INT.  DEPARTMENT STORE - NIGHT (FIRST LIGHT)

text: COLE'S light reveals a spider web just inside the store.  A large
	SPIDER tries to hide from the light.
	COLE reaches carefully into the web and plucks the spider and
	puts it into one of his specimen tubes.
	Then, he shines his light all around the once elegant store.  There's
	nothing but aisle after aisle of moldering consumer goods.

scene_heading: EXT.  DEPARTMENT STORE - DAWN

text: As COLE comes out of the store, the first rays of the sun hit the
	building.  COLE stops, squints into the light through his visor.
	COLE'S POV:  spray-painted on the wall a long time ago is a stenciled
	logo of twelve monkeys holding hands in a circle.  Over it is
	written, "WE DID IT!"
	COLE looks up.
	COLE'S POV:  high up on a building across the street, a LION
	patrols a ledge, pauses, looks out majestically over his world.

scene_heading: INT.  FIRST UNDERGROUND DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER - ETERNAL NIGHT

text: ROARING WATER, powerful torrents gushing from nozzles in the
	wall, pummel the still-suited COLE.

scene_heading: INT.  SECOND UNDERGROUND DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER - ETERNAL NIGHT

text: Stark naked and shivering, COLE is being scrubbed with brushes on
	long poles (like the ones used to wash cars) wielded by two HULKING
	FIGURES in bulky decontamination suits, their personas lost in their
	windowed masks.  It's a grim scene in a grim cement room with damp,
	dripping walls.  From an unseen source comes an AMPLIFIED VOICE,

speaker_heading: AMPLIFIED VOICE (o.s.)

dialog: Raise your arms above your head.

text: COLE lifts his arms and the FIGURES start scrubbing his armpits.

scene_heading: INT.  TINY CHAMBER - SHORTLY (ETERNAL NIGHT)

text:  Still naked, COLE is seated on a stool while a MASKED TECHNICIAN
	in a less elaborate, less bulky decontamination outfit draws
	blood from COLE'S arm with an old-fashioned hypodermic needle.
	COLE glances toward a single, nearly opaque "window" of thick
	plastic in the rusty iron wall.  VAGUE FIGURES seem to lurk
	behind the translucent aperture, studying him.
	The TECHNICIAN slips the blood sample through a slot in the wall.

scene_heading: INT.  ENGINEERING OFFICE/FUTURE WORLD - ETERNAL NIGHT

text: Ushered in by two guards, TINY and SCARFACE, COLE looks around.
COLE'S POV:  wails hidden by old headlines, articles, maps, charts...
	a blackboard covered with elaborate, sophisticated formulae...surfaces
	heaped with cracked monitors, gerry-rigged computers held together with
	string, lasers lost in tangles of cable, ancient tube amplifiers, a
	dilapidated cardboard reconstruction of a city, stacks of moldering
	books and tattered computer printouts...and, seated at a long conference
	table, staring at COLE, six SCIENTISTS:  an ASTROPHYSICIST, ENGINEER,
	BOTANIST, MICROBIOLOGIST, ZOOLOGIST, and a GEOLOGIST.  They represent
	a "modern" science where brilliant new ideas interface with crude,
	outdated, patched-together technologies.

speaker_heading: TINY

dialog: James Cole.  Cleared from quarantine.

speaker_heading: MICROBIOLOGIST

dialog: Thank you.  You two wait outside.

speaker_heading: SCARFACE

dialog: He's got a history, Doctor.  Violence.

text: COLE'S eyes return to the walls.
Headlines:  "CLOCK TICKING!  NO CURE YET!"

speaker_heading: SCARFACE

dialog: Anti-social six -- doing 25 to life.

speaker_heading: ENGINEER

dialog: I don't think he's going to hurt us.  You're
		not going to hurt us, are you Mr. Cole?

text: COLE'S head turns quickly to the ENGINEER.

speaker_heading: COLE

dialog: No, sir.

text: The GUARDS exchange a look, shrug, exit, closing the door.

speaker_heading: MICROBIOLOGIST

dialog: Why don't you sit down, Mr. Cole.

text: COLE goes to the empty chair at the conference table, sits down.

speaker_heading: speaker_heading: 

dialog: We want you to tell us about last
		night.

speaker_heading: BOTANIST

dialog: It's important to observe everything.

speaker_heading: COLE

dialog: I think it was...I'm sure it was 2nd Street.

text: As the SCIENTISTS start to whisper animatedly among themselves,
	COLE'S eyes drift across the newspaper clippings taped to the
	wall.  One headline screams, "VIRUS MUTATING!"  Another features
	a photo of an OLD MAN (DR. MASON, who we'll see again later on)
	and the words, SCIENTIST SAYS, "IT'S TOO LATE FOR CURE".

speaker_heading: ASTROPHYSICIST'S VOICE (o.s.)

dialog: Close your eyes, Cole.

text: Startled, COLE closes his eyes obediently.
BLACKNESS.  Like COLE, WE SEE NOTHING.  But we HEAR their VOICES.

speaker_heading: ENGINEER'S VOICE (o.s.)

dialog: Tell us in detail what you've seen in
		this room.

speaker_heading: COLE'S VOICE (o.s.)

dialog: Uh, in this room?  Uh...

speaker_heading: MICROBIOLOGIST'S VOICE (o.s.)

dialog: How many of us are there?

speaker_heading: COLE'S VOICE (o.s.)

dialog: Six...seven, if you count me.

speaker_heading: ASTROPHYSICIST'S VOICE (o.s.)

dialog: Tell us about the pictures on the wall...

speaker_heading: COLE'S VOICE (o.s.)

dialog: Uh, you mean the newspapers?

speaker_heading: A MONTAGE OF OVERLAPPING VOICES (o.s.)

dialog: Tell us about the newspapers.  Can you
		hear my voice?  What do I look like?
		What does he look like, the man who
		just spoke?  How old were you when you
		left the surface?

text: The VOICES blur into a cacophony and FADE INTO the droning P.A.
	SYSTEM at the airport.
