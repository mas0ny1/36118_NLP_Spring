speaker_heading: CAB DRIVER

dialog: Uh, listen... you're not supposed to
               be smoking in here.  I'm sorry,

               smoke, I give you five dollars?

scene_heading: INT.  AIRPLANE, COACH -- NIGHT

     aisle seat, using tiny utensils to eat his tiny meal.
	An OLDER WOMAN arrives in the aisle.  Welles picks up his
     tray, closes his tray table, unbuckling his seatbelt,
     struggling to get up... finally successful, balancing his
     tray, letting the woman in to the window seat.

                 following this guy... I mean, is
                 this what I get first thing?  Before

                 what, you couldn't pay me enough to
                 live down there. 

speaker_heading: AMY

                 all I can say.

dialog: Honey, I'm not, please... 

text: Amy takes Welles hand, smiling at him. 

scene_heading: INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, BEDROOM -- NIGHT

text: Welles and Amy make love in the darkness.  Standard,
     missionary position sex, little passion.  They slow to a
     finish, uneventfully, holding each other.  Their breathing
     quiets.  Their daughter CINDY can be HEARD CRYING elsewhere.

     PHOTOS show the Young Republican and Gaudy Woman in Miami:
     leaving the Art Deco hotel, the Discotheque, a restaurant...

speaker_heading: WELLES 

dialog: Your son-in-law dealt with the dry
                 cleaning franchise during the day,
                 saw that woman every night. 
                       (clears his throat) 
                 The specifics are in the report, and
                 information about the woman.  It's
                 unpleasant, I know.  I apologize... 

speaker_heading: POLITICIAN 

dialog: None too discreet, is he? 

speaker_heading: WELLES 

dialog: No, sir, he is not.

speaker_heading: POLITICIAN

speaker_heading: WELLES 

dialog: The um... you'll find my invoice in
                 the envelope. If that's all...

speaker_heading: POLITICIAN

     cap, mowing his lawn with his ROARING lawnmower.  Welles'
     yard is modest, surrounding his modest split level suburban
     one in a neighborhood of similar homes and similar yards.
     Welles turns the lawnmower, stopping to mop his brow.  One
     of his neighbors is repainting a back porch.  The neighbor
     waves.  Welles waves, resumes mowing.

     Down the lane, PINS SCATTER.  One pin remains standing.

speaker_heading: AMY 

dialog: You're not using the same guy who
                 tried to fix it?
