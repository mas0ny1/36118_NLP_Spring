text: THE MOJAVE DESERT - DUSK
          Vast.    Barren.   No signs of life.
          A BLOOD RED SUN is sinking behind the distant mountains.    The
          unbearable heat will soon become an unbearable cold.
          A YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE.    Solemn.   Weary.   Determined.

speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE

dialog:   When I was a little girl, my mother
                      would remind me each night before
                      bed to be sure to open my heart to
                      God, for he was kind, merciful and
                      just. Things changed after my
                      father left a few years later,
                      leaving her to raise me and my
                      brothers alone in a little place
                      out on the edge of the Mojave
                      Desert. She never talked about a
                      kind and merciful God again.
                      Instead she spoke of a prophecy.
                      Of a time when all the world would
                      be covered in darkness and the fate
                      of Mankind would be decided. One
                      night I finally got up the courage
                      to ask my mother why God had
                      changed, why was he mad at his
                      children. "I don't know," she
                      said, tucking the covers around me,
                      "I guess he just got tired of all
                      the bullshit."

text: And with these words the last trace of sunlight is SNUFFED
          OUT, leaving us in:
          DARKNESS...
          A darkness filled with the sounds of SIRENS, GLASS
          SHATTERING, SPORADIC GUNFIRE...a CITY FALLING INTO CHAOS.
          TITLE:   "Los Angeles, December 23rd - 1:02 a.m."
A BLOOD RED MOON
          reflected in a greasy puddle of water. Might just be the
          smog that's making it that ominous color. Then we notice
          something moving in the reflection. A dark shape, growing,
          coming down at us fast. Beat...then WHAM!

          TWO BLACK BOOTS
          land hard in the water...and we're in:

scene_heading: EXT. AN ALLEY WAY - LATE NIGHT

text:  A DARK FIGURE in a tattered trench coat tumbles onto the
          pavement, hands out to slow the impact. A beat then slowly
          he climbs to his feet, recovering from what seems to have
          been quite a fall. He has chiseled features, shaved head,
          deep-set eyes. Looks like he's been through one hell of a
          fight.
          His name, we will come to know, is MICHAEL.
          He quickly checks out his surroundings, nothing but brick
          walls above him. Where'd this guy jump from?
          A RUMBLE of thunder...then RAIN starts to hammer down.   Seems
          to motivate him.
          Michael pulls his overcoat tight around his body and dashes
          toward the mouth of the alley. He reaches the STREET just in
          time to see a FLEET OF POLICE CARS tearing around the corner,
          SIRENS WAILING, heading this way.
          He reels back into the alley way, ducks down behind a trash
          dumpster, as the BLUE AND RED LIGHTS of the POLICE CARS whip
          past.
          Michael waits for the lights to disappear, then he pulls a
          MASSIVE ORNATE KNIFE from his jacket. Considers it grimly.
          Runs his finger along its edge. Blood beads up. Razor
          sharp.
          Michael begins to peel off his overcoat, revealing his bare
          chest underneath...and skin literally covered with DARK
          TATOOS. Hard to see what they are in this light.
          As his coat falls to the ground, we DRIFT over to the BRICK
          WALL behind him where we see MICHAEL'S SHADOW crouch over,
          and then...
          ...TWO LARGE SHAPES UNFOLD FROM HIS BACK, STRETCHING UP INTO
          WHAT ARE UNMISTAKABLY...THE SHADOW OF WINGS.
          The RAIN POUNDS harder, as if punishment from the heavens.
          The glint of the KNIFE coming down fast.
          A HORRENDOUS SOUND OF FLESH TEARING AWAY FROM BONE...
          ...THE BLOODY KNIFE CLATTERING TO THE PAVEMENT...
          ...FOLLOWED BY MICHAEL'S UNGODLY SCREAM RISING UP FROM THE
          ALLEY WAY. And then SILENCE...
          CLOSE ON THE GUTTER, AS BLOOD BEGINS TO FLOW FREELY, MIXING,
          SWIRLING WITH THE RAIN...

scene_heading:           EXT. CITY STREET - A SHORT WHILE LATER

text: Michael, face tight with pain, trench coat back on, steps out
          of the alley, stares with determination at a dark storefront
          across the street.
          "GUN SPORT WORLD"

scene_heading: INT. GUN &amp; SPORT WORLD - A SHORT WHILE LATER

text:  Cavernous. A Costco for survivalists.    Quiet except for the
          sound of RAIN, then...
          SMASH! Michael drops down through one of the skylights in a
          shower of glass.

scene_heading: INT. GUN &amp; SPORT WORLD - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

text:  Michael bursts in. Tosses a first-aid kit into the sink.
          His trench coat falls to the floor and here in the
          fluorescent light, we get a better look at him.
          His thin but stunningly well muscled body is TATTOOED
          shoulder to ankle with INTRICATE WRITING. The man's flesh is
          a living book. But the writing is in no language we
          recognize.
          He turns his back to the mirror, revealing two HORRIFICALLY
          OPEN WOUNDS running down between both shoulder blades.
          FRESH. BLOODY.
          He threads a needle not with thread, but with FISHING WIRE,
          and begins to STITCH the wounds closed. BLOOD POOLS on the
          cement floor around his feet.

scene_heading: INT. GUN &amp; SPORT WORLD - MOMENTS LATER

text:  Trench coat and a shirt back on, Michael races along the
          ENDLESS RACKS OF GUNS, searching for just the right weapons,
          his every movement precise, as if he's trained his whole life
          for this.
          Weapon after ferocious weapon gets tossed into rifle bags.
          Whatever this guy's preparing for, it's big.
          Rifle bags filled, Michael heads for the exit.   Stops cold.
          The place is locked up tight.   Metal gate over the front
          doors, bars over the windows.   How the hell's he going to get
          out of here?

scene_heading:  INT. LAPD SQUAD CAR - DRIVING - SAME

text: Two COPS, world weary, cruise through downtown. That's
          BURTON behind the wheel, ESTEVEZ riding shotgun.
          The POLICE RADIO is ABUZZ WITH ACTIVITY.      Busy night.
          Burton stares out at the city's rain soaked denizens with a
          deep hatred, the shadows looming in doorways, the
          streetwalkers.

speaker_heading: BURTON

dialog: Goddamn' animals. Nights like this
                    I wish I could take a match to this
                    city just so I could watch all
                    these motherfuckers burn.

speaker_heading: ESTEVEZ

dialog: (LAUGHS)
                    A good ol' boy barbecue, huh?

text: Burton doesn't even smile.       He's dead fucking serious.

speaker_heading: BURTON

dialog: A fresh start. That's what this
                    place needs.

text: He holds his finger up like a pistol. Aims it at the people
          they pass, picking them off one by one.

speaker_heading: BURTON

dialog: Pow!   Pow!     Pow!

text: Now Burton laughs, a dark, mean laugh.      Estevez eyes his
          partner, wary.

speaker_heading: ESTEVEZ

dialog: Jesus... You know Burton, I'm so
                    happy we get to share beautiful
                    moments like this. They really
                    brighten my da--

tex: KABOOM! Through the WINDSHIELD, we see a storefront EXPLODE
          just ahead, raining fiery debris onto the squad car.
          Burton slams on the breaks and the cops look up just in time
          to see...
