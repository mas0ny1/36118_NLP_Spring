This is the github repository for "Group 1"  
The primary objective of this project is to develop a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model capable of predicting the age rating of a movie based on its screenplay. This project aims to create an automated and efficient system for providing age ratings, which can be beneficial for movie producers, distributors, and regulatory bodies. This repository contains all code for the models discussed in the report.
