"0","Because so little of what occurs on-screen either engages or entertains, there's ample time for the boiler of your self-respect to build up quite a head of indignation at the forfeiture of your time, money, and (exceedingly minimal) cerebral exertion.","4","242998"

"4","There are legitimate excuses for going to see Pixels. Losing a bet, perhaps. Having a loved one held for ransom. Maybe a serious blow to the head. But none of those (except maybe the last) would allow you watch and actually enjoy the latest cinematic leavings of Adam Sandler.","8","2120120"

"8","Clash seems to be deliberately steering clear of camp, when in fact it should have steered straight into camp and stepped on the gas.","10","800320"
"9","Every character, every scene, is marred by the film's double view, which oscillates between sympathy and farce.","10","64115"
"10","Scrooged is an appallingly unfunny comedy, and a vivid illustration of the fact that money can't buy you laughs. Its stocking spilling with big names and production values galore, this updating of Dickens' A Christmas Carol into the world of cutthroat network television is, one episode apart, able to generate only a few mild chuckles.","10","96061"

"13","What Horrible Bosses 2 lacks in nasty repartee, it tries to make up for in poorly staged comedy chases and break-ins. It is the Hollywood equivalent of a rambunctious little boy pointing to the toilet and squealing, “Mommy, look what I made!”","10","2170439"
"14","An entertainment-free sinkhole of Dramamine-worthy nonsense.","10","2870612"

"28","Holly Hunter and Sigourney Weaver, a cop and a shrink, are the main trackers, but so little is done in Ann Biderman and David Madsen's script to give them or their colleagues or even their prey interesting human dimensions that the overall ambience is chiefly pornographic.","10","112722"
"29","The movie is exhausting, utterly without feeling, and pointless -- though Smith looks great in his Western outfit.","10","120891"
"30","The point, I think, is the sheer callous inappropriateness of comedy existing within the physical reality of the camps -- even the imagined reality of a movie.","10","118799"

"34","A shockingly mundane disappointment taken on its own and a deeply misguided refraction of the original.","10","844708"
"35","All I saw were unimpressive digital effects; artless, quick-cut abstracted gore; and a last-ditch attempt to evoke a visceral response by heaping the climactic scene with bat shit.","10","200469"

"37","I spent a lot of time during the new Corey Haim-Corey Feldman movie, License to Drive, trying to figure out where it is set. Then it hit me. IT IS SET IN HELL! Hell, in this case, is a place where all the actors are named Corey. Where everyone is under the legal drinking age. Where everybody still breathes through his mouth and Oxy-5 flows like champagne.","10","95519"
"38","A new low for director Alan Parker, this trite mystery thriller does for capital punishment what his ""Mississippi Burning"" did for civil rights: with its muddled message, liberal piety, and slick Hollywood plot mechanics.","10","289992"

"40","I’m getting fed up with classic films being remade or ruined by being turned into “Special Editions” that are less than special.","10","268695"
"41","The Great Outdoors is about as much fun as ants at a picnic for anyone over the age of 10. It's a crass, blah comedy about summer vacation perils that teams Dan Aykroyd and John Candy, but gives them next to nothing to work with. If the prolific and profit-making John Hughes weren't the writer--as well as the co-executive producer--of this scattershot nonsense directed frenetically by Howard Deutch, it's hard to imagine the film getting made, let alone attracting Aykroyd and Candy.","10","95253"
"42","Seven Years in Tibet feels more like Seven Days in the Movie Theater. It refuses to come alive--not even when Brad Pitt, hirsute as a yak, wanders the frozen Himalayas with an Austrian accent that probably gave his dialogue coach hives.","10","120102"
"43","Leaves you feeling as if you've been alternately milked and bitch-slapped. Its manipulation is so clumsy and obvious -- and, ultimately, it goes so far astray from its original guiding principles -- that it leaves you feeling dangled and dazed.","10","251160"
"44","That skunky smell emanating from Your Highness ain't pot; it's the stink of miscalculation that surrounds an inside joke gone awry.","10","1240982"
"45","Director Joe Johnston's elaborately dressed kids' movie--about a board game that sucks its players into a perilous jungle overrun by lions, rhinos, monkeys, crocodiles and spiders--spends so much time on the how of special effects that it neglects the why of characterization.","10","113497"
"46","Wild Things reaches such dizzying heights of wretched dialogue, creaky contrivances, and panting performances, you're forced to wonder if the filmmakers realized how bad their script was and switched gears into pure camp at some point during the shoot.","10","120890"
"47","Valentine simply mines the same tired, predictable slasher-movie vein as everything else he's (Blanks) done thus far. Send this one back unopened.","10","242998"
"48","Jason goes to hell, and not a moment too soon. His descent has been far too long in coming, as the exhausted, witless Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday demonstrates.","10","107254"

"53","Sitting through the picture is an endurance test.","10","881891"
"54","This tedious retelling of the venerable fairy tale-""Twilight"" with Oedipal kinks-takes place in a medieval village that is plagued by a werewolf, and that looks like a shtetl settled by California actors.","10","1486185"
"55","Pitched as a black comedy, the film thus far seems to have divided audiences between those who think it unaccountably hilarious and those who see it as the latest manifestation of what might be called the new nihilism.","10","124198"
"56","Let's call this ""rethinking"" The Abysmal.","10","95250"
"57","My mind wasn't simply wandering during the film - it was ricocheting between the screen and the exit sign.","10","84809"
"58","Its creepy use of DMX's daughter is reprehensible, but the film is otherwise so unrelentingly sleazy that its use of the child-in-danger gambit actually qualifies as one of its subtler moves.","10","306685"
"59","The movie veers uneasily from not-funny comedy to not-persuasive melodrama. Murphy forgets that the dialogue in old-fashioned crime pictures was as highly stylized as the settings. In place of sharply polished wisecracks, he gives us the steady mutter of the witless, unfelt obscenities that are the argot of our modern mean streets. [27 Nov 1989, p.88]","10","97481"
"60","Billed as a comedy, but it could also be billed as a drama, a satire, an allegory, or a film (partially) noir. It wouldn't matter, or help... Not since Robert Altman has any American filmmaker been as overrated as this pair. [30 Sept 1991]","10","101410"

"62","Like a dinner-theater version of the ""Alien"" movies without the good grooming.","10","211443"
"63","There's more suspense in On Golden Pond. And when the predictable ending comes, it has none of the titanic man-versus-beast struggle of the original. It all happens so quickly, you wonder if you've missed something. But, no you haven't, because there it is -- the familiar calm sea . . . of credits.","10","93300"

"68","Not even court-ordered rehab could save this stumbling drunk of a picture.","10","191754"
"69","What must be said is that the new movie is simply awful: poorly structured, vulgarly written, insipidly directed, monotonously performed.","10","107840"
"70","Maybe Kevin Bacon can use the Twinkie defense to explain Hollow Man.","10","164052"
"71","An abomination.","10","389860"
"72","With a shamelessly cliched script by Amy Holden Jones (based on a novel by Jack Engelhard) that includes a speech plagiarized from Citizen Kane, the results are only for those who can take fare like ""Valley of the Dolls"" with a straight face and want to see Redford play Jay Gatsby again.","10","107211"
"73","This pricey, juiceless pulp could never have been killed by critics, simply because it was already dead.","10","1046173"
"74","Weide's big-screen version is sitcom-drab.","10","455538"
"75","The remake neither pays perceptive tribute to the original nor updates it in anything but hackneyed form.","10","454082"
"76","Not that much deep thinking went on here.","10","174480"
"77","Looks like the deformed spawn of a development process gone awry.","10","257076"
"78","McKay's bumptious movie awkwardly combines fourth-wall-breaking gimmickry and flaccid indignation with the goofball energy that defines his comedies.","10","1596363"
"79","""Only Living Boy"" fails to convince as a character study, romance or love letter to the CBGB-era New York City. It drops a plot bombshell close to the end of its 88-minute running time, but the filmmakers haven’t laid the track to make it plausible.","10","460890"
"80","Tautly directed by David Slade, this drama probably offers more sadism than anyone could possibly want...The characters are absurd, but if you're up for this sort of thing, then surely you can con yourself into accepting them. Personally, I'd rather have this movie obliterated from my memory.","10","424136"
"81","Shamelessly manipulative in a crude, bullying way.","10","230838"
"82","It's dispiriting to see good actors doing smart, solid work with so much unadulterated garbage swirling around them. Scott's art is also death, and we, the audience, are the ones he's jabbing at with his ruthless paintbrush. It's about time someone told him where to stick it.","10","328107"
"83","The afterlife is not, however, nearly as deadly or as ghastly as the movie itself, an undertaking so tortured that it digs a deeper grave with every passing scene.","10","838247"
"84","Watching Ramis struggle with his two stars is like watching someone try to juggle lead weights.","10","122933"
"85","The source of this movie's energy is near-perpetual desperation. You can see it in Tom Cruise's fixed grin, and in the mad proliferation of unspecial effects.","10","1013743"
"86","[Gere] seemed to be improvising his way from beginning to end, like he was disgusted with the actual script.","10","163187"
"87","At its core this is just another piece of big-studio nothingness. The characters are so underwritten they barely qualify as types, and the movie is badly paced, bookended by high-ordnance action sequences but painfully static in the middle.","10","431197"
"88","Not wishing to spoil the fun -- pretty hard to come by anyway in this 1998 blockbuster's 150 minutes -- I won't tell you the outcome, but I'll wager you can guess.","10","120591"
"89","Directed by Jonathan Demme, and starring Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington, this AIDS courtroom drama is so pumped full of nitrous oxide, you could get your teeth drilled on it.","10","107818"
"90","Ms. Vikander has leapt into the void of a franchise reboot, based on a video-game reboot, that generates no joy, makes negligible sense, and seals its own tomb with a climax of perfect absurdity.","10","1365519"
"91","Like a wounded yeti, Batman & Robin drags itself through icicle-heavy sets, dry-ice fog and choking jungle vines, before dying in a frozen heap. Unfortunately, that demise occurs about 20 minutes into the movie, which leaves you in the cold for approximately 106 minutes.","10","118688"
"92","A 23-minute movie dragged out, via some narrative gimmickry, to a punishing hour and a half.","10","443274"
"93","Also zero, which is the amount of inspiration and achievement in this continuing saga of the little boy who drowned in Crystal Lake 30 years, seven films and approximately 286 teenagers ago (30-7-286)","10","97388"
"94","Such a stupid, painfully obvious, gratingly unfunny dud that it's unlikely to please even the most gullible and easy-to-please members of the Kiss army.","10","165710"
"95","A manifesto in the form of an enormously budgeted quasi-sci-fi epic, Cloud Atlas is evidently personal, defiantly sincere, totally lacking in self-awareness, and borderline offensive in its gleeful endorsement of revenge violence against anyone who gets in the way of a good person's self-actualization. The rest of the time, it's just insipid, TV-esque in its limited visual imagination, and dramatically incoherent.","10","1371111"
"96","The bad news for everyone else is that the colorfully named characters from Clue remain flat enough to be stored in a box, and that all three endings are unpersuasive. [23 Dec 1985, p.79]","10","88930"
"97","I found Tourist hell to sit through. [23 Jan 1989]","10","94606"
"98","In this smutty kiddie farce he's a clownish action toy, and he grows wearying, fast.","10","109040"
"99","For a suspense drama, Impact is a slack, oddly enervated and mawkish soup of largely lethargic performances.","10","120647"
"100","This is the sophomore production from ""Juno"" screenwriter Diablo Cody, similarly told through ultra-stylized slangy teen dialogue, which is cool, in theory, in the way it respects the verbal resourcefulness of idle flyover kids, but is excruciating to listen to in actual fact.","10","1131734"
"101","If I were a Christian, I'd be appalled to have this primitive and pornographic bloodbath presume to speak for me.","10","335345"
"102","An abominable, abdominal comedy. Aside from its tastelessness and dawdling pace, the movie’s chief problem is the lackluster chemistry between leading lummoxes Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels.","10","109686"
"103","Let's cut to the chase: We're talking ""Ishtar of the Apes.""","10","185183"
"104","See evil. See evil run. Run, evil, run all the way to cable television purgatory.","10","288477"
"105","Johnny Mnemonic looks and feels like a shabby imitation of Blade Runner and Total Recall. It is a disaster in every way.","10","113481"
"106","A vile concoction. [25 July 1983, p.75]","10","85346"
"107","In the end, I'm wondering what's so special about a film that has but one guilty pleasure and that's Ben Kingsley spraying saliva-lubricated variants of the F-word into the atmosphere like anti-aircraft fire for 10 solid minutes.","10","203119"
"108","In spite of a sturdy cast and dazzling production design, Highlander is stultifyingly, jaw-droppingly, achingly awful.[11 Mar 1986, p.5]","10","91203"
"109","A plodding, aggressive film that is neither engaging, disturbing nor funny.","10","116367"
"110","All the special effects in the world cannot compensate for an inability to generate tension, establish and sustain pace or create any character whose survival is worth rooting for.","10","185371"
"111","Running a mere 83 minutes, A Night At The Roxbury still feels like an eternity spent in bad high-concept-movie hell.","10","120770"
"112","The film doesn’t lack for audacity, or ultimate purpose — it’s against hate and in favor of love. But the adaptation isn’t funny enough to sustain the style, which owes an overt debt to Mel Brooks and amounts to Springtime for Hitler Youth.","10","2584384"
"113","Director Jeannot Szwarc strains hard for spectacular visual effects, though he's barely able to compose a competent close-up.","10","81534"
"114","Adam Sandler displays no virtuosity and stirs no pathos in this special-effects comedy.","10","185431"
"115","Stunning in its guileless self-love, Smith's doodle-movie shows virtually no sign of being made for an audience. The 90-minute by-product of Smith's let's-shoot-a-movie pot party can be mystifying -- we've all stood soberly by as high friends guffaw at nothing in particular, but now we can pay for the privilege.","10","261392"
"116","A promotional gimmick that's being slipped into theaters with the sort of stealth accorded only the unprofitable or the unwatchable.","10","286162"
"117","The shallowest ""serious"" film to be reeling this year.","10","976051"
"118","Hitchcock rings false from start to finish.","10","975645"
"119","Every truly awful movie epic has a point of no return, a moment when the accumulated bad lines and bogus sentimentality become so cloying that the best defense against a mounting queasiness is an awed amusement.The Postman, offers a new opportunity for levity every few minutes after its first hour.","10","119925"
"120","It is hard to say what is more dispiriting about True Romance the movie itself or the fact that someone somewhere is sure to applaud its hollow, dime-store nihilism and smug pseudo-hip posturing as a bright new day in American cinema. [10 Sept 1993]","10","108399"
"121","An intellectual and a sensualist, Cronenberg graces Crash with philosophical musings, acres of pretty flesh and even more penis talk than on some 8 o'clock sitcoms. For all that, Crash doesn't work.","10","115964"
"122","The Happening makes you wonder whether Mr. Shyamalan's own switch may have been flipped. How else to explain his film's befuddling infelicities, insistent banalities, shambling pace and pervasive ineptitude?","10","949731"
"123","A painfully anemic variation on John Landis' 1981 winner, ""An American Werewolf in London."" While the original had both wit and poignancy--and an affectionate and knowing tip-of-the-hat to werewolf movies past--this slapdash, silly new edition is so cut-rate it has Luxembourg and Amsterdam standing in for the City of Light.","10","118604"
"124","An insufferable piffle.","10","357470"
"125","A tedious mock-medieval adventure yarn that's easily the worst film so far this year...Without a single clever line of dialogue (by contrast, Arnold Schwarzenegger's one-liners rank with Oscar Wilde's) or a story of even marginal coherence, the movie relies entirely on visual overkill to bludgeon the viewer into a state of comatose submission. [19 Feb 1993, p.L23]","10","106308"
"126","Isn't any fun at all, which is ultimately the most damning thing you can say about a Bruckheimer movie.","10","368891"
"127","Timeline has negative energy to burn. There's even less of it by the end than at the beginning.","10","300556"
"128","While the film is well-paced, visually it is deathly dull.","10","144964"
"129","A noisy, impenetrable and totally nonsensical cogitation on the nature of firefighters and the sizzling ""animal"" they love...We just wish somebody would call 911 for boredom.","10","101393"
"130","Sequels to big-budget popular hits usually end up super-slick, shallow and inflated. But this one isn't even super-slick; it's shallow and deflated...The overall effect is of a story atomized and dying before our eyes, collapsing into smashed pulp, ground down into big-budget Kryptonite ash. [27 July 1987, p.1]","10","94074"
"131","A vicious, grindingly manipulative urban mystery that uses a thick atmosphere of S & M kinkiness to distract the audience from the story's thinness and inanity.","10","103772"
"132","If you thought Abu Ghraib was a laugh riot then you might love Observe and Report, a potentially brilliant conceptual comedy that fizzles because its writer and director, Jody Hill, doesn't have the guts to go with his spleen.","10","1197628"
"133","By the end of The Watcher you'll need your own prescription.","10","204626"
"134","Achieves a certain cinematic distinction by outdoing ""Dumb and Dumber"" in sheer grossness and detail with its depiction of the unfortunate effects of explosive diarrhea.","10","1220628"
"135","The Lost Boys is a horrifically dreadful vampire teensploitation entry that daringly advances the theory that all those missing children pictured on garbage bags and milk cartons are actually the victims of bloodsucking bikers.","10","93437"
"136","It's not the worst movie ever made; it just seems to be. Its 134 minutes induce a state of simulated brain death, an effect as easily attained in half the time by staring at the blinking lights on a Christmas tree.","10","105665"
"137","Debuting writer-directors Larry and Andy Wachowski come off like Coen brothers wannabes with no sense of humor.","10","115736"
"138","This is a movie that should have a medical warning in its trailer. Caution: viewing may be hazardous to your filmgoing fun; side effects can include drowsiness, irritation and difficulty swallowing.","10","211933"
"139","Drop Dead Gorgeous eventually shows that it doesn't like anybody -- in the movie or in the audience.","10","157503"
"140","Like Thor's hammer, this ersatz epic bludgeons its victims into submission. What's more, it requires them to stare at the source of their punishment through 3-D glasses.","10","800369"
"141","Little more than an exercise in sustained contempt, a petty little missive directed at anyone who dares to wield a pen.","10","2114461"
"142","The ""stone""-shtick gets mighty old after about 15 minutes. More than 30 screenwriters worked on the Flintstones script, and the result just proves the ancient saying about too many cooks.","10","109813"
"143","There is a whiff of an interesting idea in there, but it is buried in tedious scenes lacking clear direction, endless generic (and poorly lit) shoot-outs, and cringeworthy sequences of allegedly witty banter. This movie is an absolute wreck.","10","5519340"
"144","To put it delicately, this comics fan hated Batman v Superman with the fury of a thousand red-dwarf suns. Blunt, humorless, and baffling, it collides the brutish directorial stamp of its director (he of 300 and Watchmen fame) with the most shameless instincts of our latter-day superhero franchise bubble.","10","2975590"
"145","The falling blade is the only element not missing the mark in this film. I wanted to call for the beheading after Act One, and spare the audience instead.","10","467200"
"146","As written by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child, The Relic deserved to be taken off the shelf; as adapted by a quartet of screenwriters and directed by Peter Hyams, it should have been left on one.","10","120004"
"147","It's an astonishingly crass and vulgar film, crudely directed on a cut-rate budget by Brian Robbins, never more than almost funny or less than disturbing.","10","477051"
"148","I see Austin Powers as Myers' desperate cry for help -- a plea to stop him before he does schtick again.","10","118655"
"149","Size vanquishes both substance and subtlety in the overhyped, half-cocked and humorless resurrection of dear old ""Godzilla.""","10","120685"
"150","Even with a look at many of these people's relationship problems, there's nothing remotely interesting to listen to when they talk. In this case, it's the fault of the script, which doesn't provide much of anything interesting to keep it going for as long as it does.","10","307879"
"151","More than sad, it's slightly sickening to consider the technology, talent and know-how squandered on Hostage, a pile of blood-soaked toxic waste dumped onto the screen in an attempt to salvage Bruce Willis's fading career as an action hero.","10","340163"
"152","[Antoine Fuqua] gives in to terrible instincts here, flirting with overwrought patriotism, one too many laugh lines amid numerous characters being shot in the head, and a general chaos-inspired editing technique all too rampant in today's action cinema.","10","2302755"
"153","How much do I loathe this film? A lottico is putting it mildico.","10","1284575"
"154","What we have here is a fouled-up fairy tale of oppression and empowerment, and it’s hard not to be ensnared by its mixture of rank maleficence and easy reverie. The gap between being genuinely stirred and having your arm twisted, however, is narrower than we care to admit.","10","929632"
"155","With Yes Man, Carrey has bled the well dry, doing everything he knows how to do, over and over again, just to prove that he still knows how to do it. It's exhilarating to see brilliance in a comic; but by the time you start smelling it, the game is over.","10","1068680"
"156","The Neverending Story is a graceless, humorless fantasy for children, combining live actors and animated creatures in mostly imaginary settings.","10","88323"
"157","The cinema of morons made by morons for morons, Swordfish is everything you expect but worse.","10","244244"
"158","The new horror-thriller is cheesy, asinine, convoluted and ludicrous. On the plus side, if your eyeballs need a vigorous workout, this will have them rolling nonstop.","10","1241317"
"159","In one respect at least, the film's idiocy works for Lopez: Every diva needs at least one camp classic on her résumé, and with Enough, she's scored a howler on the level of ""Mommie Dearest.""","10","278435"
"160","The usually reliable director Michael Caton-Jones hasn't a clue how to freshen up such stale material.","10","119395"
"161","It's too bad, then, that Anderson (whose only other major credit is ""Mortal Kombat,"" but of course) and first-time screenwriter Philip Eisner felt so compelled to do away with suspense and turn Event Horizon into a big-budget slasher film.","10","119081"
"162","A football film made by a man who apparently has seen little of the game outside of movies, and not very good ones at that.","10","146838"
"163","More uselessly redundant and shamelessly money-grubbing than most third-rate horror sequels.","10","220506"
"164","The language is leaden, the pace glacial and the characters indecipherable. It's easier to read the actors -- they all seem eager to win an Oscar. Fat chance.","10","120824"
"165","Kin is insufferable, self-seriously combining shut-in nerdiness with wannabe macho pyrotechnics. It’s Bro Cinema in all the worst imaginable senses of the term.","10","6017942"
"166","Let's give this ghastly studio comedy a Truthiness in Advertising award, if nothing else.","10","1488555"
"167","So dull and awful, you actually wonder if this is some kind of Andy Kaufmanesque in-joke, a deliberate attempt to douse the spark that made the original film so enjoyable.","10","289848"
"168","Friday the 13th Part III is terrible, too...There are some dandy 3-D sequences, however, of a yo-yo going up and down and popcorn popping.","10","83972"
"169","My Homo sapiens brain was boggled by the movie's clumsiness, while my heart was chilled by the chance that otherwise mature members of my species might mistake this disjointed botch for summer entertainment.","10","133152"
"170","There's something reassuring about the fact that The Avengers is so rotten: proof yet again that people with piles of money can hire wizard production designers but can't fake class.","10","118661"
"171","Like Sherman McCoy, the hero of Tom Wolfe's ""The Bonfire of the Vanities,"" Brian De Palma makes one fatal choice that leads to disaster. The disaster is the movie The Bonfire of the Vanities. The choice was De Palma's decision to film it as a cartoon -- a broad, black, wannabe savage comedy. Every unfortunate moment of this screechy, heavy-handed movie is a result of that basic misconception, compounded by the fact that the comedy is staged by a man who seems to have temporarily lost his sense of humor. [24 Dec 1990, p.63A]","10","99165"
"172","I Am Number Four's CGI sequences are murky and dark, its performances negligible, its script genuinely inept. There is, I should note, a puppy, which arguably keeps the film this side of completely unbearable, but just barely.","10","1464540"
"173","Has so many things wrong with it that one can only stare at the screen in disbelief. [25 April, 2011 p. 89]","10","1334512"
"174","The movie feels like a thin excuse to show image after image of women being abused. This Martyrs has the bones of its predecessor, but it's been bled dry.","10","1663655"
"175","For a film loaded with decapitations and gun-toting ladies in bondage gear, Sin City gets really tedious really quickly.","10","458481"
"176","From the get-go, Levinson makes every wrongheaded directorial decision imaginable in an apparent effort to make one loathe Assassination Nation—and his success in that regard proves this teensploitation schlock’s lone triumph.","10","6205872"
"177","This reprehensible and deeply unfunny film is obviously critic-proof.","10","129387"
"178","A Eurotrashy vidgame knockoff that misses its target by a mile. Numbingly unthrilling as it lurches from one violent encounter to another, the pic's dark roots in an electronic, non-dramatic medium are plain to see, and unsuspecting gamers lured to theaters will soon wish they were back home participating in the action themselves.","10","465494"
"179","This is shtick that’s minimally a generation past its expiration date.","10","1045778"
"180","Sitting through the last reel is significantly less charming than listening to a four-year-old with a taste for exaggeration recount his Halloween trip to the Haunted House.","10","286106"
"181","The big news in Blade II is that there's something worse than vampires, but is there something worse than Blade II?","10","187738"
"182","The film stinks from start to finish, like a wet burlap sack of gloom.","10","283632"
"183","Why Him? is trite, crass and insultingly moronic.","10","4501244"
"184","Disappointing in every aspect.","10","229260"
"185","As this clueless, bulimic debacle madly regurgitates ideas and iconography from Lang to the brothers Wachowski, Leni Riefenstahl to L. Ron Hubbard, Ray Bradbury to Susan Faludi, it's not just Bale who has a hard time keeping a straight face.","10","238380"
"186","The movie's a floating longboat that ought to be ignited and pushed out to sea, Viking style.","10","120646"
"187","There's not a single thing about Air Force One to recommend, except perhaps the controlled performance of Glenn Close, who does remarkably well as the recipient of several phone calls from the sky.","10","118571"
"188","A numbing and dispiriting experience aimed at the least discriminating parts of the teen-age audience.","10","113749"
"189","Les Mayfield's unintentionally wry American Outlaws just smells -- of filmmaking manure as well as yard-sale revisionism.","10","244000"
"190","Watching it, you feel as if you're being hammered to death with champagne corks.","10","98343"
"191","The movie’s most disturbing aspect, of which the filmmakers could not have been unaware, is the physical resemblance between Mr. Elba and Ms. Larter to O. J. and Nicole Brown Simpson. It lends Obsessed a distasteful taint of exploitation.","10","1198138"
"192","The general opinion of Revenge of the Sith seems to be that it marks a distinct improvement on the last two episodes, ""The Phantom Menace"" and ""Attack of the Clones."" True, but only in the same way that dying from natural causes is preferable to crucifixion.","10","121766"
"193","It's a terrible life, and a terrible movie.","10","289879"
"194","The Godfather Part III isn't just a disappointment, it's a failure of heartbreaking proportions... It makes you wish it had never been made.","10","99674"
"195","The movie is a noisy, useless piece of junk, reverse-engineered into something resembling popular art in accordance with the reigning imperatives of marketing and brand extension.","10","1482459"
"196","A self-adrenalizing, self-destructing pop-culture whirligig.","10","166276"
"197","Watching it is like being forced to listen to bad heavy metal music turned up to 11 while fat guys in Bermuda shorts compete in a puking contest in the john.","10","120669"
"198","Convoluted, overstuffed, turned up to 11, and yet, somehow, deadly dull--in other words, white noise.","10","429493"
"199","It's just that this clunky, inane vehicle sputters barely a few feet down its quaint English highway before you want to bid it ""do zvidániya, dumb-ass!""","10","188453"
"200","Not since ""Howard the Duck"" has there been a big-budget comedy with feet as flat as those of Joe Versus the Volcano. Many gifted people contributed to it, but there's no disbelieving the grim evidence on the screen.","10","99892"
"201","It's arguably one of the emptiest, feeblest, most derivative scripts ever made as a major studio movie. There's no need to do a Mad magazine movie parody of this; it's already on the screen.","10","93773"
"202","For most, there will be no adrenaline rush from fear or thrill, or vicarious release from seeing tormentors tormented; one leaves feeling sad. Sad that this is what ""entertainment"" has come to. Come on, filmmakers. Can't you do better?","10","1242432"
"203","The movie is a peculiarly irritating failure -- a leaden piece of uplift.","10","101889"
"204","As you sit through the interminable two-hours-plus that constitute The Fifth Element -- a colossally stupid, overbearingly pompous new movie by Luc Besson -- you can expect to become acquainted with boredom on the most elemental level.","10","119116"
"205","Warner Bros. is presumably aiming this movie not at children but at full-grown dopers with bad munchies glued to the Cartoon Network. Dude, pass the Scooby snacks.","10","267913"
"206","I wouldn't want you to consider even renting this thing. It would only encourage another prequel, this time featuring two dumb toddlers who keep walking into doors and become great pals. Call it ""Duh and Duh.""","10","329028"
"207","A shit stain on the genre.","10","240900"
"208","Overblown and idiotic, this new ""erotic thriller"" is neither erotic nor thrilling; it's long, boring and self-indulgent.","10","259711"
"209","Conjures up plenty of debauched tableaux with its photogenic, jaded showbiz denizens and hangers-on, but nary a reason for existing.","10","865554"
"210","Rips off so many splatter movie tricks at once that it becomes totally frustrating.","10","251736"
"211","Eragon is laughably bad, mind-bogglingly derivative, and easily one of the worst movies of the year.","10","449010"
"212","Legend may turn out to be legendary, but not in the way the filmmakers intended. As a flight of fancy, it has the balletic grace of the goony bird, crashing on takeoff and spending the next 90 minutes in a fluttering tizzy on the ground. [24 Apr 1986, p.D3]","10","89469"
"213","Gives us good reason to believe that January really is the month Hollywood studios use to bury their cheesiest mistakes.","10","218817"
"214","Wallows in its own muck.","10","134273"
"215","Kills whatever charm the first movie had by recycling its few serviceable parts.","10","145660"
"216","It's probably not the year's worst film, but it would be difficult to imagine three more interminable, snooze-inducing hours of film than you'll find watching this narcoleptic dinosaur.","10","119643"
"217","The Expendables is savage yet inert, and breathtakingly sleazy in its lack of imagination.","10","1320253"
"218","There is a line between gallows humor and tastelessness, but Very Bad Things apparently doesn't have a clue where that might be.","11","124198"
"219","Sloppy, confusing, and dull as a dented crucifix.","11","204313"
"220","What the kids at my screening seemed to like best was the wizard's cat, whose mouth is computer-manipulated to utter pithy asides.","11","472181"
"221","What is love? Haddaway asks in the omnipresent soundtrack song. Not this time-wasting bilge, that's for sure.","11","120770"
"222","Little more than a cluttered, noisy, and unsatisfying thrill ride to nowhere.","11","859163"
"223","Steer clear, Friends of Ol’ Marvel!","11","1502712"
"224","As Timeline so adequately proves, not every bestseller will render a good film.","11","300556"
"225","Koteas' overearnest performance almost makes The Haunting in Connecticut worth a look, but ultimately even the star of Cronenberg's ""Crash"" can't salvage what is essentially a substandard rip-off of ""The Amityville Horror.""","11","492044"
"226","Isn't for everyone, obviously; it might not be for anyone, come to think of it.","11","1300851"
"227","This fourth and, presumably, final entry into the ever-deteriorating Hellraiser series is by far the worst of the lot: a jumbled, unsatisfying, and ultimately boring glimpse into the past, present, and future of the notorious cenobite affectionately known as “Pinhead”.","11","116514"
"228","Insidious: Chapter 2 is perhaps an even more scattershot mess than its predecessor. Whannell's script is so rife with portentous backstory, third-act goofiness, and a denouement that practically screams ""Insidious 3: Same Old Shit,"" that the film as a whole is jarring, and not in a good way.","11","2226417"
"229","The film is a mess, going all over the graveyard but never finding the grave. It's the work of a fan with too much time (and money) on his hands, eagerly awaited but best forgotten.","11","251736"
"230","I'd use the term science fiction to describe Skyline but the movie decidedly lacks both science and fiction.","11","1564585"
"231","As film theorist Siegfried Kracauer once wrote, to paraphrase, art often blooms in the most hostile soil. No such luck here.","12","401729"
"232","A truly dreadful film, a lifeless, massive, lumbering exercise in failed comedy. Elaine May, the director, has mounted a multimillion-dollar expedition in search of a plot so thin that it hardly could support a five-minute TV sketch.","12","93278"
"233","Someday, The Bounty Hunter and last month’s “Cop Out” will be featured in a cable movie double bill as the two worst 1988 films of 2010.","12","1038919"
"234","In striving for a combination of grit and grandeur, Leterrier misses a chance to make the kind of camp classic that could have endured for generations. Instead, it's a muddled disappointment.","12","800320"
"235","I can't remember ever seeing such a spectacular implosion of a squad of all-stars as Rise of the Guardians. Well, not since Yankee Stadium in October.","12","1446192"
"236","Alone in the Dark will be the worst movie of 2005. The idea that anything could be worse is the only genuine scare the movie has to offer.","12","369226"
"237","If his direction is erratic, the script he wrote with Annie Mumolo (Bridesmaids) has gaps you could drive a truck through and dialogue filled with painfully obvious exposition of plot, motive and theme.","12","2446980"
"238","Hellbound: Hellraiser II is like some kind of avant-garde film strip in which there is no beginning, no middle, no end, but simply a series of gruesome images that can be watched in any order.","12","95294"
"239","Here's a science-fiction film that's an insult to the words ""science"" and ""fiction,"" and the hyphen in between them. You want to cut it up to clean under your fingernails.","12","1217613"
"240","Good Luck Chuck, a fungal little sex comedy, doesn't need a review. It needs a tube of ointment and a shot of penicillin.","12","452625"
"241","It stumbled onto an accomplishment truly awe-inspiring: It makes “Battleship” and “The Watch” look good.","12","2120120"
"242","Every movie's gotta have a gimmick, and Crank's is that it has an excellent shot at ending 2006 as the worst film of the year.","12","479884"
"243","There's a reason you've never seen the words ""Will Forte"" topping the billing of a major motion picture. After the throbbing flameball of unfunny that is MacGruber, you never will again.","12","1470023"
"244","It's a movie without a brain. Charlie's Angels is like the trailer for a video game movie, lacking only the video game, and the movie.","12","160127"
"245","To make a film this awful, you have to have enormous ambition and confidence, and dream big dreams.","12","266452"
"246","Racially offensive quips, flagrant sexism and Tourette syndrome gags all contribute to this witless, scare-free junk.","12","3829266"
"247","Toss this ugly-ass crap to the curb, along with the other multiplex garbage, and see a romance that gets it right. I'm talking ""(500) Days of Summer.""","12","1142988"
"248","This adventurously awful film is awful in many ways at once.","12","811080"
"249","Consequently, as star vehicles go, Ford Fairlane runs straight over the very guy it's meant to transport. Some will see that as the movie's greatest fault, others as its only virtue. Take your pick, and come out swinging. [13 Jul 1990, p.C1]","12","98987"
"250","License to Drive, directed by Greg Beeman and written by Montreal's Neil Tolkin, is not only stupid, a virtual requirement of summer teen exploitation movies, it's also nasty: it's been designed to turn its swooning target audience into a pajama party of neurotics. [08 July 1988]","12","95519"
"251","The Brady Bunch Movie, which was directed and written by at least fivepeople whom we prefer not to embarrass, looks bad, sounds bad and doesn't makeany sense. There's even something nightmarish about it. All these bad jokesand vacant sets become almost horrifying, as if the film were on the verge ofproving that life itself is a bad joke on a vacant set. [17 Feb 1995, p.J]","12","112572"
"252","After Earth stupefies us with nonsense, such little thought and logic went into this idea that it can’t even be considered a rough draft, this is a movie almost daring an audience to emotionally detach throughout. For shame!","12","1815862"
"253","If the John Candy-Dan Aykroyd comedy The Great Outdoor had a few more laughs we might be tempted simply to write it off as mediocre and let it go at that. But this woodland farce is just coarse enough, and unfunny enough, to achieve true awfulness.","12","95253"
"254","The most painful movie so far in a year that's already scraping the bottom of the barrel, Your Highness is a tedious, dung-colored misfire that sullies the genre of ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" and ""The Princess Bride.""","12","1240982"
"255","How on earth is it possible for one film to be so tiresome? Spring Breakers isn’t deadly dull despite all the nudity and violence, but because of it.","12","2101441"
"256","Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie is about as close as you can get to absolute nothing and still have a product to project on the screen.","12","113820"
"257","Not that anyone expected logic, but no one expected the series to so completely abandon much of what was familiar to the audience and become an amalgam of countless other horror-fantasies and pop culture media. [16 Aug 1993, p.24]","12","107254"
"258","A dark comedy about a bachelor party gone awry, it is excessively violent, ghoulish, and gory. Very Bad Things is lack-of-taste taken to the extreme.","12","124198"
"259","Most of American Psycho just sits there, looking at trouble, rather than looking for it - complacent, overjoyed in fact to exist at all.","12","144084"
"260","It's not a bomb at all. A dud is more like it - Last Action Hero isn't interesting enough to be explosively bad. For all the inflated pyrotechnics on the screen, the picture seems consistently grey and almost pitiably small. [18 Jun 1993, p.D1]","12","107362"
"261","[Pitof's] managed to create an entire digitalized city that has all the allure of an underground parking garage. And his action, it's cluttered; his editing, it's confused. The result: blandness butchered, hamburger chopped, kitty littered.","12","327554"
"262","The camera regards Guzman's buttocks and Lopez's breasts with an evasion of visual pleasure that could be blamed on the actors' nudity clauses if the entirety of the film didn't resemble a Lifetime movie embarrassed to have found its way to theaters.","12","3181822"
"263","Jason X sucks on the levels of storytelling, character development, suspense, special effects, originality, punctuation, neatness and aptness of thought. Only its title works.","12","211443"
"264","This movie is a cross between the Mad Slasher and Dead teenager genres; about two dozen movies a year feature a mad killer going berserk, and they're all about as bad as this one.","12","82418"
"265","Among the mysteries of Hollywood life is the terribleness of Jaws sequels; they are the very worst of a bad lot. Now comes No. 4 -- Jaws the Revenge -- and it is as wretched as it is ungrammatical. [17 July 1987, p.1D]","12","93300"
"266","The movie crassly repurposes tragedy to excuse its cliches.","12","1403981"
"267","A terribly bad movie, one of the worst of its kind in recent years.","12","164052"
"268","Crude and witless.","12","195714"

"271","Sucks bad, real bad.","12","1265990"
"272","Besson has always demonstrated the ability to chuckle at the madness of his own material, and he provides some solid laughs from time to time. But these winks do nothing to erase the reality of a plot that becomes unintentionally hilarious.","12","2872732"
"273","Manages to jerk more than a few tears at all the right moments.","12","174480"
"274","Plays like an amateur debut effort written over a weekend during which its writer wasn't entirely sober.","12","263488"
"275","Man on Fire is ponderous and bloated, dragging the Bible and Giannini into its swirling cesspool. Scott can't give the movie any real emotional weight. And Washington gives his first lifeless performance.","12","328107"
"276","Six has now made a film deliberately intended to inspire incredulity, nausea and hopefully outrage. It's being booked as a midnight movie, and is it ever. Boozy fanboys will treat it like a thrill ride.","12","1467304"
"277","Clue the movie, not the board game, isn't so much a drama as it is a marketing gimmick. Presumably, Paramount Pictures believed that an audience was clamoring to see actors play one-dimensional figures from a game. [13 Dec 1985, p.57]","12","88930"
"278","If filmmaking has ever been less thrilling and more disengaging, I'd like to see it.","12","185183"
"279","This is a movie without wit, style or reason, and the true horror is that actors were made to portray, and technicians to realize, its bankruptcy of imagination.","12","93177"
"280","This is a dishonest, quease-inducing ""comedy"" that had me feeling uneasy and then unclean. Who in the world read this script and thought it was acceptable?","12","265208"
"281","Every once in a while, a movie comes along that is so boring and pointless, that those faithful movie-goers who never walk out on a film have to find some alternative to watching the mind- numbing stupidity unfolding on the screen.","12","120770"
"282","The best thing in the movie is Peter MacNicol as Dana's boss at the museum, a slippery character with an incomprehensible accent. [16 Jun 1989, p. E1]","12","97428"
"283","The manner in which the writer, Richard Matheson, and Jeannot Szwarc, in his glory days the director of Jaws II, conspire to tell the story should not only render the audience tearless, but speechless as well. [11 Oct 1980, p.E7]","12","81534"
"284","If you've ever seen Psycho, or even if you know anything at all about the film, Sacha Gervasi's Hitchcock would like to congratulate you on your savvy.","12","975645"
"285","Johnny Depp’s perfunctory gestures and flailing pratfalls befit a film that brings the franchise’s theme-park roots full circle.","12","1790809"
"286","Stunningly stupid! Amazingly bad! Incredibly awful! Just downright terrible! [17 Feb 1993]","12","106308"
"287","It reeks of contempt for the audience. This is not just a ""B-movie"" -- it's a B-movie that fails to entertain on any level.","12","300556"
"288","Shapeless, tedious, hopelessly bad sequel.","12","144964"
"289","The Unborn joins a growing glut of Holocaust- and Nazi-themed material -- ""Valkyrie,"" ""Defiance"" - that are long on posturing, suppositions, and righteousness, yet short on moral complexity. Nazism and its crimes have lately inspired theme parks more than actual movies. Too many rides on that roller coaster and I feel sick.","12","1139668"
"290","The film may leave you wondering what purpose this franchise serves if not to give expression to Michael Bay's nationalist, racist, and misogynistic instincts.","12","1502397"
"291","This one is a big, big disappointment. [27 July 1987]","12","94074"
"292","Like ""Rocky Horror Picture Show,"" Heavy Metal makes most sense as a midnight weekend feature, when many of its viewers are likely to be herbally and chemically addled. Without the help of intoxicants, Heavy Metal comes across as what it is - a wildly sophomoric and stupid cartoon celebrating gore, rape and bad music.","12","82509"
"293","The costumes, on-location scenery and stunts were fantastic. Unfortunately, the acting made the witty script downright dull. When it comes to these Three Musketeers, I have to say the better version is behind the candy counter.","12","108333"
"294","Dreck of the lowest kind — a sleazy exploitation film that is all the worse because it has somehow convinced itself that it is thoughtful and profound.","12","2948790"
"295","To be honest, I started hearing things, too. Just when Jones was delivering an inexcusably sappy speech about baseball being ""a symbol of all that was once good in America,"" I heard the words ""If he keeps talking, I'm walking.""","12","97351"
"296","The original tv series was sometimes frightening, sometimes enlightening, and sometimes a bit too allegorical, but it was almost always entertaining. Serling gave us more in 25 minutes than Spielberg & Co. give us in nearly two hours. [24 Jun 1983, p.1]","12","86491"
"297","Not only is this take on human relations unoriginal, it's also sophomoric and blatantly untrue.","12","1602613"
"298","Shoot ’em up, run ’em over, blast ’em with flame-throwers, who cares? These creatures are only there to go splat.","12","432021"

"301","Paul Haggis’ Third Person has nothing to say and spends 2 ¹/₂ hours not saying it. Its combination of pretentiousness, vanity and vapidity suggests Alain Resnais directing a triple episode of “Guiding Light.”","12","2343793"
"302","Several times during this film, you wish you were a bottle rocket so you could explode out of your seat and leave this tedious mess behind.","12","115734"
"303","A bloody mess...The effects are nothing you haven't seen before; the acting is so broad, it borders on the ridiculous; and the story, once intriguing, has become ludicrous. [11 March 1996, p.C3]","12","116514"
"304","This movie -- G.I. Joke, The D-Team -- tries to do so little, and yet falls so short. A clue comes when the girl asks Clay, ""How's your steak?"" and he replies, ""Meaty."" Simple enough to achieve in theory, but this would-be treat for cinematic carnivores is a sawdust sandwich.","12","480255"
"305","I do have one overpowering Y2K fear: that Hollywood will keep belching out movies as excruciatingly dull, brutal, mindless and overlong as End of Days.","12","146675"

"314","That a drop from John Williams’s Jaws score wouldn’t be out of place on this film’s soundtrack goes to show how tactlessly Paul Greengrass milks tragedy for titillation.","12","7280898"
"315","At some point, I just tired of looking at all the nicely composed shots unworthy of the stock they're printed on. Lives are at stake here, and I don't mean Julia's and her annoying pals'. I mean the lives of you and me, the only pronouns that really matter here.","12","283632"

"317","The melodramatic clumsiness of the script, and, in one scene, its gratuitous endorsement of marijuana, betrays the youth of its writer, recent UCLA graduate Shane Black.

"340","It's sad to see mercurial talent unused, and even more disheartening to see it completely wasted. Color of Night, the first film in 14 years from director Richard Rush, is a dreadful miscalculation of a comeback; a sexual thriller equally lewd and ludicrous. Rush has already disavowed the reworked version opening nationwide today, promising his original vision will be available later on video. [19 Aug 1994, p.7B]","16","109456"
"341","While it's rarely scary, the film is often gory.","16","245120"
"342","The whole noisy movie is really just a setup for the climactic duel between renegade cop Danny Glover and the monster. By that point, you’re pathetically grateful for a few stomach-churning special effects.","16","100403"

"348","Return to Sender proves to be nothing but dead air, an entirely too predictable, slow-paced, and misguided genre effort.","16","2948790"
"349","Duffy's inept command of actors, not to mention his utterly juvenile morality and his comically clumsy use of religious iconography, should keep all but the diehards away.","16","1300851"
"350","It is a movie ostensibly about consequences that never lingers long enough on its own story to consider that the things happening in the narrative present ought to have consequences as well. Very little matters; very little makes sense.","16","2975590"
"351","Witless, insultingly derivative, muddy-looking, and edited in the hammering epileptic style that marks so many films produced, as this one is, by Michael Bay.","16","1464540"
"352","A crude, silly supernatural thriller.","16","145531"
"353","In many ways, the film is history repeating itself, as the same Weinstein brothers who famously dropped $10 million on ""Happy, Texas"" in 1999 have overpaid again for ""Happy, Texas 2.""","16","1107319"
"354","The hilarious diminuendo of that title is such that the movie might as well have been called ''Wes Craven Presents: Not a Hell of a Lot.''","16","283632"
"355","The result is a dead pile of information in search of a movie.","16","399295"
"356","It doesn't have the imagination or daring to make a full turn to self-parody.","16","229260"
"357","It adds up to a truly taxing couple of hours: ham acting, visual noise, aural torture, elementary plotting and unconvincing emotions.","16","293508"
"358","Pretty much the worst recent example of a genre.","16","364045"
"359","At this point, revenge thrillers have become so standardized that these films are really all the same film — a Mixmaster blend of Death Wish, Dirty Harry, Enter the Dragon, and Rambo. A star with a personality would only gum up the works.","16","99739"
"360","Such a witless, bombastic, by-the-numbers hunk of millennial hooey it made me nostalgic for Commando. This one throws in every hoary hellfire cliché.","18","146675"

"362","Dejah, with her seen-it-all-before smirk, is not a very sympathetic heroine, and Kitsch is stolid and dull. And as for the red planet, the answer to David Bowie's famous question is no. What a sadd'ning bore it is.","20","401729"
"363","Jaws 3-D, in which the Amity horror swims south to Florida, looks a lot like a Poligrip commercial, what with its extreme close-ups of the Great White's artificial chompers. [29 July 1983, p.17]","20","85750"
"364","May be the most disappointing American comedy of the decade, partly because it's jokeless and joyless but mostly because it squanders an all-star cast of superb comic talent.","20","1225822"
"365","Highlander 3 has an edge over its prequels in that it's so shoddily directed that it's probably a great deal of fun to watch after a couple of six-packs. Actually, that's probably the only time it might be fun to watch, and I'm not going to be the guy to put that theory to the test for you.","20","110027"
"366","The couple drive into town, body in the boot, looking for help, but they won't find any in the script, which totters from one cliché to the next, eventually disappearing up its own cornhole in a conflagration of cheap FX.","20","87050"
"367","However you dress it up, laughs where there should be frights is patently piss poor.","20","171363"

"370","What's wrong with this sad fiasco goes far beyond its visual deficits.","20","800320"
"371","You may view Untraceable, as I do, as a repugnant example of the voyeurism it pretends to condemn.","20","880578"
"372","Reality Bites embodied seemingly every odious post-Nirvana media trend. The title alone was laughably faux-hip, and the movie's portrait of slackerdom—limply enacted by Winona Ryder, Ethan Hawke, Steve Zahn, and Janeane Garofalo—was both broad and shallow...No one acknowledges the obvious—that a heinous idea got even worse when Stiller signed on to direct.","20","110950"
"373","While expertly executed animation-wise and passably entertaining for very young kids (less so, their parents), is still as dull as the hull on Rocketship X-M.","20","762125"
"374","Actually it's not a bad notion for a satiric comedy and this one begins well, but then veers entirely out of hand until it's as over-inflated as its own Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come and as funny as a mugging. [23 Nov 1988, p.1]","20","96061"
"375","Screenwriter Dean Georgaris gets a hell of a pass here – the story is canon, and, in terms of emotional wallop, does all the heavy lifting for him – but he still manages to gunk up the works with dialogue that is dull-witted at best and outright howling at its worst.","20","375154"
"376","Laudable as its world-building is, the film drags not just in its interminable middle hour, but also during the redundant monster-on-mechawarrior smackdowns.","20","1663662"
"377","A movie called Horrible Bosses, or even a movie called Horrible Bosses 2, should essentially write itself. Unfortunately, that's exactly what the creators of these two movies wanted their cast to do, and the result is puerile, ugly and painfully unfunny.","20","2170439"
"378","Because it unfolds like a garish hybrid of Simon Birch and What Dreams May Come, with some horror-movie touches thrown in to keep us from nodding off, ""The Sixth Sense"" appears to have been concocted at exactly the moment Hollywood was betting on supernatural schmaltz.","20","167404"
"379","Not a single arresting image is found amid the sci-fi rubble, though unintentional laughs eventually arrive courtesy of a cornball motivational speech by Eckhart's hero.","20","1217613"
"380","What saddened me, however, wasn't the silliness but recognizing the great Swedish actress Lena Olin under a lot of ""Elvira, Mistress of the Dark"" makeup. What a waste.","20","238546"
"381","A galactic slump of a movie that stuffs its travel bag with special effects but forgets to pack the charm.","20","120738"
"382","The most perfunctory horror picture I’ve seen in some time.","20","5690360"
"383","There are precious few things for a Zorro fan – or a film fan, for that matter – not to loathe about The Legend of Zorro.","20","386140"
"384","It's a paint-by-numbers job of the worst sort, stuffed with more tired old baseball baloney than Harry Caray and about as dramatic as shagging flies in St. Pete.","20","265662"
"385","This film just wades into a murky lake of self-consciousness and sinks inexorably to the bottom.","20","5691670"
"386","Director McGrath retains the novel's highlights, but he slices everything to ribbons.","20","116191"
"387","Unfortunately, the film rests heavily on the shoulders of Murphy, who seems to wander aimlessly from scene to scene, searching for a laugh. The joke's on him, though: There are none.","20","104114"
"388","About as bad as it gets?a thrill-less ""Speed"" wannabe.","20","163579"
"389","Maybe it would work better if the script -- which is credited to four screenwriters; never a great sign -- was actually funny.","20","1967614"
"390","Once upon a time, this wackiness had some novelty value. Now it’s tedious.","20","3062096"
"391","This film marks for Jon Voigt a concerted effort to unseat Christopher Walken in the competition for the Czarship of sneering, wheezing, Machiavellian, all-around weird guys. He spends much of his time standing around making a face like Beavis does when he's really freaked out.","20","118615"
"392","Phil Alden Robinson’s overheated dramedy feels disconnected from reality in every emotional way.","20","1294970"
"393","It's a cheap, easy rehash of Spielberg's ""Duel"" and ""The Hitchhiker"" (which Red may not have seen)--along with grabs from ""Halloween"" (the unstoppable fiend), ""Jackson County Jail"" (the innocent motorist driven outside the law) and ""Straw Dogs"" (manhood through blood rites). Nothing is original.","20","91209"
"394","Veers between flaccid slapstick and mean-spirited vulgarity.","20","452625"
"395","Staggeringly misjudged in virtually every department, from the wannabe effervescent script to Johnny Depp's dopey hairdo.","20","1243957"
"396","A rambling disappointment.","20","112573"
"397","Of all the missteps made and absurdities offered, the most glaring is the casting of what appears to be a steroidal Eurotrash pimp as no less than Dracula.","20","359013"
"398","Where Sandler once exulted in our outrage (and frequently, our laughter), he now seems barely capable of mustering enough effort to carry a scene, let alone advance to level 255 of “Galaga.” There’s no joy left in his shtick.","20","2120120"
"399","“I will search for you through 1,000 worlds and 10,000 lifetimes!” Reeves promises his beloved. Anyone who sits all the way through this glossy folly will know exactly how that feels.","20","1335975"
"400","To call MacGruber""a total bomb is a bit much, but this comedy-action flick sure feels like it was put together with gum, shoelaces and a couple of sticky Twizzlers.","20","1470023"
"401","The usual Spielberg rhetoric about the sanctity of childhood and the beauty of dreams seems wholly factitious in this crass context, which even includes a commercial--in the form of a rock video--for the tie-in merchandise.","20","89218"
"402","Most of all, though, I wondered how much longer people will pay to see a walking, running, driving, diving, punning, smirking, swimming, skiing, shooting, parachuting corpse.","20","143145"
"403","Martin's grin-and-don't-bare-it performance lifts the picture above sitcom level. [31 Dec 1991]","20","101862"

"405","Michael Lehmann's ""Heathers"" followed the same sort of story line to much better effect in 1989, and Clueless leaves you itching to race over to the video store in search of just that.","20","112697"
"406","Speed can be a virtue, but there’s something extremely off-putting about the way The Wolfman, Universal’s latest horror classic redux, races through its opening scenes.","20","780653"

"408","Maybe it was fun to bathe in decadence back then. But this is no time to wallow in that mire.","20","101761"
"409","DiVito turns actors like Robin Williams, Edward Norton, and Catherine Keener into nothing less horrific than giant Danny DeVitos.","20","266452"
"410","With a movie like this, there's no risk of spoiling the ending, because the entire plot is merely a formality trudging toward a foregone conclusion. The viewer's biggest challenge is to survive fits of yawning so violent they could disrupt ornithic migratory patterns.","20","252503"
"411","By the end of this mercifully short excuse for a horror movie, you'll be wishing the beast had chowed down on the entire ensemble.","20","139414"
"412","What Lies Beneath is my head on the movie theater floor, snoozing through this film.","20","161081"
"413","He (Perry) has taken Shange's landmark poem cycle for seven African-American actresses, cut it up, and sewn its bloody entrails into a tawdry, masochistic soap opera that exponentially ups the ""Precious"" ante.","20","1405500"
"414","A rambling wreck from computer tech and a helluva souvenir –- that is, for those interested in artifacts representing the American movie at its worst.","20","120891"
"415","In this climate, turning even a small corner of this century's central horror into feel-good popular entertainment is abhorrent.","20","118799"
"416","Cynical and contemptuous of its audience, this lazy sequel oozes an insufferable air of self-satisfaction.","20","122151"
"417","The Dark Knight director has had a mortifying effect on movies. In this case, it’s almost as if Affleck’s somber plunge into the calamitous, Nolan-produced ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" has followed him into other projects, like a heavy cologne. Avoid this one like the stink it is.","20","2140479"
"418","A movie without a moment of truth to be found.","20","1142988"
"419","The movie doesn’t have a funny bone in its body, clomping from one unoriginal set piece to the next with a head-scratching lack of urgency.","20","1245526"
"420","A work of hilarious, nearly Ed Wood-worthy ineptitude.","20","200469"
"421","Gets to be dislikable in its glib feelgoodness. The movie's many excellent actors do too much acting with too little conviction in scenes that rush through perfunctory setups to deliver pat payoffs.","20","314331"
"422","You see, this character, who is given no back story, is Life with a capital L. He is the Forneys' guardian angel who rouses them out of their funk. Given the movie's U-turn into allegory, maybe he's supposed to be a punk Jesus. Not even Mr. Gordon-Levitt's unremittingly savage performance can begin to salvage such hokum.","20","1403177"
"423","Though the film is not as criminally poor as ""V for Vendetta,"" which the Wachowskis wrote in 2005, it struck me as more insidious.","20","811080"
"424","Although the premise of getting or not getting a first driver's license is a solid-enough base for 90 minutes of teenage comedy, License to Drive misses the point on all counts.","20","95519"
"425","Going through the motions of a liberal-Hollywood polemic with the sweaty, mounting hysteria of a bad liar, The Life of David Gale is foremost an overheating gotcha machine, scripted by first-timer Charles Randolph with seams showing and red herrings stinking up the joint.","20","289992"
"426","A ditsy and dizzying spook-house thriller in high-tech, high-hemline gear.","20","120804"
"427","Fails on both an emotional and comedic level.","20","395699"
"428","If it's remembered at all, it will be as a time capsule of early-21st-century blockbuster cowardice and redundancy.","20","268695"
"429","Could have been T2 with seraphs, or Assault On Precinct 13 crossed with Revelations. Instead, it’s a lazy genre bore. Doesn’t bode well for Priest, the next Stewart/Bettany film in the pipeline.","20","1038686"
"430","Erin Brockovich is slick, grating and false. We bet it makes a bundle.","20","195685"
"431","The Purge is one of those unimaginative horror flicks that depend on skreeky music and sudden appearances to startle, but never actually frighten, the audience. The characters are undeveloped, the twists clumsily telegraphed and unsurprising.","20","2184339"
"432","Proof of Life isn't a movie. It's an overpriced scrapbook.","20","228750"
"433","The script has no nuance, none. And when Shyamalan moves into the director's chair, the script problems are magnified. Everything is spelled out, underlined in red.","20","1815862"
"434","Scripted by the extraordinarily prolific John Hughes, directed by Howard Deutch, and starring John Candy and Dan Aykroyd, this disappointing comedy should have been much funnier given the talent of those involved.","20","95253"
"435","Butter essentially eats its own premise, then proceeds to bludgeon us with unfunny, unoriginal political satire.","20","1349451"
"436","This movie, written in crayon by James Kearns, is too dumb to come up with a way of defeating the system by using its own rules.","20","251160"
"437","It's not just our emotions that are being played on here, it's not just our intelligence being insulted because of Ron Howard and Akiva Goldsman's presumption that we won't have any interest in a character whom it's not always possible to like. It's John Nash's life, being turned into an Oscar machine and an easy way to jerk tears.","20","268978"
"438","While it’s based on the bizarre 2007 story of the female astronaut who drove 900 miles in adult diapers to confront an ex-boyfriend, Lucy in the Sky doesn’t include that intimate detail. Then again, the movie shits the bed in so many other ways, it may have been overkill. Director Noah Hawley (TV’s Fargo) omits the headline-making undergarment, instead stocking up on paper-thin observations about workplace misogyny and mental health in a cloying feature debut that begs to be scorned.","20","4682804"
"439","They (De Niro, Burns) look good together. But what a staggering pity they chose such a nasty, hackneyed movie to demonstrate their chemistry.","20","179626"
"440","Director Joe Johnston (""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"") turns this fantasy into a mean-spirited exercise in terror.","20","113497"
"441","Whatever small pleasure there is to be found in this loud dud is due mostly to the residual good feelings from the first film.","20","99423"
"442","Brooks' shallow screenplay feels half-finished, and he never compensates with additional guidance or directorial flair. So all his actors are forced to flail about ineffectually. Apparently, none of them read the script in advance. Because surely then they'd have known to take a pass.","20","1341188"
"443","Spaceballs is actually a kind of comic black hole. All in all, the movie is about as funny as having coffee spilled in your lap. Except that there's no burn -- just that slightly embarrassing, uncomfortable, all-wet feeling.","20","94012"
"444","Despite the cast -- Kevin Bacon, Matt Dillon, Neve Campbell, Denise Richards, Daphne Rubin-Vega, Theresa Russell, Robert Wagner, and Bill Murray -- I found it preposterous.","20","120890"
"445","Bizarre, confused, sanctimonious manure that makes Lurie's own ""The Contender"" look responsible by comparison.","20","272020"
"446","This one, a debut feature, is awfully inept, whereas the short isn’t long enough for ineptitude to take hold, or for a story to develop.","20","4786282"
"447","As it stands, The Ruins is about as interesting as a pile of old stones and a monkey-dumb yanqui falling prey to the horrors of globalization. And that's pretty dumb.","20","963794"
"448","Looking good but lacking much in the way of personality or gray matter -- rather like its characters -- Valentine is a straightforward slasher pic that's acceptably scary until a weak finale.","20","242998"
"449","On the movie's feeble plus side are Richard Gant's acting (as the coroner), Manfredini's music and one funny joke in the last half-minute. On the minus side: ludicrous characters. Garbled nonstop gore. Persistent loud, clanging noises that give you the impression of being trapped inside a malfunctioning radiator. Shadowy lighting that makes you feel as if you're staggering around in the dark. [16 Aug 1993, p.F3]","20","107254"
"450","In the real world, a debate has been raging over what does and doesn’t constitute torture. In the movie world, there’s no debate; watching The Interview is torture from almost start to finish.","20","2788710"
"451","Not even the addition of satanic rituals, farm implements or a Howard Stern-like shock jock (Leo Geter) is enough to paint over the creaky trappings.","20","113253"
"452","Shows about a third less craft than its all-too-lame predecessor, and it's only half as funny. If those are figures you can deal with, enter the theater at your own peril.","20","257106"

"457","Indisputably awful comedy.","20","881891"
"458","To paraphrase the play's most famous song: how do you measure the lien against your soul when you're forced to sit through something as forcibly maudlin as Rent? I dunno, but 525,600 minutes is about how long this movie felt at times.","20","294870"
"459","Ford's earthy Everyman and Pitt's vengeful youth are probably more interesting than they have any right to be inside these tired macho roles. Of course, Rory and Tom could be bursting with blarney and the movie still wouldn't gather any momentum.","20","118972"
"460","The amazingly awful dramatic thriller Red Riding Hood could, with tweaks, be enjoyably bad in a ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" kind of way. Instead, it's M. Night Shyamalan-style bad, which means despite all the unintentional snickers, you feel trapped.","20","1486185"
"461","Very Bad Things is a guy film, and, as such, it's a dog. The gross-out humor lacks edge, the guilt never kicks in, and the outrages are predictable. It's one flat brewski.","20","124198"
"462","Would like to think of itself as an extension of its lead character -- gangly, a bit uncouth, but ultimately sweet. Unfortunately, it's more like the best friend in a movie like this -- irritating, unfunny and something that hangs around longer than it should.","20","815236"
"463","Stillborn, pointless piece of work.","20","144084"
"464","A dreadful remake of the French farce LE JOUET (1976), THE TOY is poorly written, over-directed, and filled with sophomoric attempts at humor. Only Richard Pryor's personal energy manages to save it from being complete rubbish.","20","84809"
"465","A heavy dose of movie-colony narcissism posing as warts-and-all honesty.","20","254099"
"466","There are incredibly almost never any really terrific scares in 92 minutes - just multiple shots of violence and gore that are more gruesome than anything else.","20","82495"

"469","The cozy sentimentality in The Time Traveler's Wife is the only thing that grounds it. Mostly it's just featherheaded.","20","452694"
"470","The goal here was to show the tragic downfall of a once-praised hero, similar to the actual poem written by Wilde with the same name. But because of the lack of depth in supporting characters and half-baked writing, this movie couldn't have ended fast enough.","20","2404639"
"471","It’s Fatal Attraction 101.","20","3181822"
"472","Kick-Ass - based on a graphic novel - thinks it's so brave and bold. But it's more like the title character, a dweeb who just thinks he's tough.","20","1250777"
"473","Perhaps Steven Soderbergh's metamorphosis from clever Cajun auteur (""sex, lies, and videotape"") to heavy-duty Eastern European angst-master has been altogether too successful. Like authentic Soviet Bloc cinema, Kafka makes its audience suffer along with its heroes.","20","102181"
"474","The whole thing devolves into such highfalutin silliness that it’s impossible to care what happens to whom. In Mr. Guadagnino’s previous film, “Call Me By Your Name,” the tone was romantic, and sustained to the very end. In Suspiria, style stomps fun into submission.","20","1034415"

"482","The director, Joseph Sargent, doesn't bring out any of the possibilities in the material -- not even the scary ones. And Michael Caine is wasted, though not completely. He manages to provide at least a little suspense, even if it's the extracurricular sort, by raising the question: Will an Oscar winner be allowed to become fish food?","20","93300"
"483","A crass, sophomoric and, more to the point, offensively unfunny parody that sets out to remake Shaft and his blaxploitation ilk as a Jewish action hero.","20","317640"

"488","Too glib too often to make much of an impression any way you look at it.","20","191754"
"489","Tomorrow Never Dies, like the commercial marketing assault the Bond cast has been involved in, is a hollow experience that's egregiously trumped up by its high energy glitz and gimmickry. Somewhere, in their rush to amaze and thrill, the filmmakers forgot about Bond, the man.","20","120347"
"490","For those who care, Madonna has found her match in Guy Ritchie, whose absence of talent when it comes to the film medium is equal to her own.","20","208092"

"492","Color of Night is a knuckleheaded thriller that means to get a rise out of audiences, but will merely make them see red. It's confounding and sad that director Richard Rush waited 14 years to make another film after his striking ""The Stunt Man,"" only to choose a script as dismal as this.","20","109456"

"501","The best parts of the movie occur during the outtakes, which are genuinely funny. The movie proper is insufferable.","20","266915"
"502","A very bad film--snide, barely competent, and overdrawn--that enjoys a perennial popularity, perhaps because its confused moral position appeals to the secret Nietzscheans within us.","20","66921"
"503","But it's also Howard's and his audience's misfortune that a good time can be had by all only if nothing of substance gets said.","20","131369"
"504","A crass physical comedy of unrelenting irrelevance with a gag or two amid the many other examples of bad taste, extrapolating toward infinite on the theme of remote control reality.","20","389860"
"505","A romantic thriller of more than usual ineptitude.","20","225071"
"506","In Adrian Lyne's latest monstrosity, love takes on money -- and loses. Not necessarily in the story, of course. This is a Hollywood movie. I'm talking between the lines.","20","107211"
"507","Phoenix is acting so hard you can feel the desperation throbbing in his veins. He leaves you wanting to start him a GoFundMe, so he won’t have to pour so much sweat into his job again. But the aggressive terribleness of his performance isn’t completely his fault.","20","7286456"
"508","The serious Catholic themes that made the original film genuinely disturbing have been flattened out into a cartoonish backstory.","20","204313"
"509","G.I. Joe was not screened for critics, but that’s not because of its mindless action and nonsensical plot. It’s because G.I. Joe is the kind of movie that bludgeons the viewer into submission with its loud and constant barrage of sound and fury.","20","1046173"
"510","Problem is, this movie is all surface - to quote one character, it has hidden shallows.","20","455538"
"511","With a peephole-riddled set and a flashback-heavy screenplay, Black Christmas smothers terror beneath a blanket of unnecessary information, revealing too much and teasing too little.","20","454082"
"512","I Love You Phillip Morris not only blasts gay stereotypes back decades, it could actually make people wish for a third ""Ace Ventura"" movie. Both of those are an accomplishment, though neither is a compliment.","20","1045772"
"513","Tis embalmed drama is a ghost from the '80s, a decade that regularly produced surprise-free, caramelized biopics. The airless Amelia is missing practically everything.","20","1129445"

"517","The funny thing about all these sub-""Matrix"" shenanigans is that they’re genuinely meant to stoke thought and reflection. Frankly, though, few movies have left me feeling as shorn of gray matter.","20","2872732"
"518","Ricki Lake, who occupies one of the lower links on the TV trash-talk food chain, is promoted to ugly duckling in Mrs. Winterbourne, a film that waddles through the movie-memory super-mart shoplifting everything but charm.","20","117104"

"520","Brings absolutely nothing new to the autopsy table that wasn't previously covered.","20","1232783"

"522","What this juvenile adventure has in spades is special effects and picturesque locations. What it lacks is an emotional link to make the Saturday afternoon he-man posturing palatable, or at least bearable.","20","111282"
"523","There's a reason potboiler paperbacks don't make good movies - there's too much outlandish plot, even for Hollywood.","20","1189340"

"525","Promises to speed up the pacemakers of grumpy old Republicans with its ruthless indictment of the unzipped presidency.","20","118548"
"526","While The Only Living Boy in New York looks nice (it was shot on film by veteran DP Stuart Dryburgh), it's an unabashed fake — glib and movie-ish in a grating way, with lots of prefab ""soulfulness"" and none of the texture or rough edges of life.","20","460890"
"527","Stone's all-purpose conspiracy theory, built like a house of cards, rivals ""Mississippi Burning"" in its sheer crudeness and contempt for the audience.","20","102138"
"528","The Forsaken discourages one from caring in the least how its breed of vein-tappers came to be, or even what will happen if they take over the world.","20","245120"
"529","Bogus on every level, right down to its half-hearted trick ending.","20","183649"
"530","There isn't a milliliter of honest feeling from start to finish, and precious little comedy or romance.","20","401445"
"531","Without a character to really care about, the movie just comes off as fraught and over-stylized.","20","1825157"
"532","It could be said that Reeves is one of the great manifestations of the mysteriousness of stardom. He gives the worst performance in Sweet November, and he's the best thing about it.","20","230838"
"533","Feels razor thin. None of the characters is particularly noteworthy. And the revelations of deep-seated conspiracy in the usual privileged, closed circles are hackneyed and tired.","20","120681"
"534","It's hard to believe the creative mind that gave us ""Almost Famous,"" ""Jerry Maguire,"" ""Say Anything"" and ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" looked up with satisfaction after typing 117 pages of this.","20","368709"
"535","With every bit of sliced flesh and every punctured skull I found myself wondering who exactly this movie is for. Its unflinching violence has earned it an R rating, meaning its desired demographic – teenage boys – is out of contention. That raises the question: Are there really adults who want to sit through this kind of mindless, bullying mayhem?","20","493464"
"536","This smug and callous action-comedy is about nothing but teeth.","20","1013743"
"537","Maybe writers Josann McGibbon and Sara Parriott were thinking of Tracy and Hepburn--assuming they were thinking of anything--but not even Roberts's smile can put this one over.","20","163187"
"538","Much of the confusion, as well as the lack of dramatic rhythm or character development, results directly from Bay's cutting style, which resembles a machine gun stuck in the firing position for 2 and a half hours.","20","120591"
"539","There are swords and sorcery, pirates and monsters, taxed bodices and taxing mythology. In other words, there's the bare minimum necessary to summon this dismal movie into existence.","20","816462"
"540","Excruciatingly stupid movie.","20","1467304"
"541","Smurftastic! Now where's that noose?","20","472181"
"542","The problem with this movie is the problem with most Renny Harlin movies: There's an excessive amount of excess -- a mind-numbing plurality of firearm battles, vehicular explosions and brutally frank sexual talk.","20","116908"
"543","Lacking most kinds of inspiration and geared to undemanding minds, this project is so overloaded with hardware and stunts, it's a relief to have it over.","20","118688"
"544","The movie is barely sufferable.","20","241303"
"545","If you can work your way past Vantage Point's goofy casting that places a bland, blank-eyed Hurt in the White House, then I suppose you can manage to forgive this ""Rashomon"" rip-off's other glaring idiosyncrasies, of which there are many.","20","443274"
"546","But (Jason) will never change and never die, not while cheap, dull ax-murder movies can yield one witty, misleading, probably lucrative commercial.","20","97388"

"548","The cast never has much chance to shine. And the main attraction is kept all too understandably under wraps.","20","165710"
"549","It's bad enough to ban on purely artistic grounds.","20","430308"
"550","A lumbering journey that conveys none of the joy or mystery of exploration. Star Gerard Depardieu's unintelligible linereadings and director Ridley Scott's murky mise-en-scene make it a hard film to hear and see, let alone like.","20","103594"
"551","When will Hollywood learn that a genre trend can last for years if itís nurtured with decent scripts? No time soon, apparently.","20","146336"
"552","The film becomes particularly risible when family matters come into play. Since the young demigods, by nature, are raised in single-parent homes, their encounters with the gods are characterized less by wonder than by the therapy-speak of wounded kids with daddy issues.","20","814255"
"553","The Hateful Eight wears out its welcome well before the halfway point, leaving the equivalent of a whole other movie to sit — and suffer — through.","20","3460252"
"554","It is difficult to work out what to dislike most about Victoria and Abdul: the literal foot-licking or the cliché-ridden plot, but the greatest shame is the waste of a genuinely fascinating piece of history and a world-class Judi Dench performance.","20","5816682"
"555","The most obnoxious case of masculine swagger since Andrew Dice Clay, with just a tad of Paul Lynde thrown in for spice, Jim Carrey defies you not to bolt for the exit while playing the title hero in this 1994 comic mystery.","20","109040"
"556","These folks are so blase, you'd think that scientists had predicted pennies from Heaven instead of world's end within the year.","20","120647"
"557","So contemptuous toward its own characters, and its audience, that it chokes off any visceral thrills it might have offered. The movie substitutes calculation for brains, and the filmmakers seem to think we'll all be too stupid to notice.","20","1131734"
"558","Gibson makes sure that no blow remains unfelt, and his approach can't help but stir the body, but he never touches the soul.","20","335345"
"559","Cameron manhandles the real story, scavenging it for his own puny narrative purposes. It's a film made with boorish confidence and zero sensitivity, big and dumb and hulking.","20","120338"
"560","Polanski, generally, has fallen farther than Lucifer, and into a more profoundly depressing hell, the hell of utter banality.","20","142688"
"561","That in such a miserable film I could still care whether his character lived or died is, perhaps, the greatest proof that Chow Yun Fat's a movie star.","20","142192"
"562","There is something deeply crass about this facetious nonsense, and everyone involved in this film might want to reflect that Nazi medical experimentation during the second world war did in fact happen, under circumstances other than these. It was a very real thing, not just a death-metal horror movie gag.","20","4530422"
"563","Seems like a miscalculation on multiple levels.","20","185183"
"564","A better name for it would have been the Herschell Gordon Lewis: the godfather of gore himself couldn't have topped this succession of grisly deaths.","20","288477"
"565","Brian De Palma dedicates this 1983 feature to Howard Hawks and Ben Hecht, authors of the 1932 original, though I doubt they would find much honor in his gory inflation of their crisp, 90-minute comic nightmare into a klumbering, self-important, arrhythmic downer of nearly three hours.","20","86250"
"566","The story has more holes than a shot-up metal door, the acting feels bored at best, and the intermittent action, while passable, hardly makes up for the downtime.","20","467197"
"567","Directing his first feature, artist Longo seems dazzled, like a rabbit, by sheer visual overload.","20","113481"
"568","Christopher Isherwood’s seminal queer novel deserves a film adaptation that captures both its sense of place and its activist spirit. Cowriter-director Tom Ford settles for the glossy ephemera of a Vanity Fair cover spread.","20","1315981"
"569","The more calculated Vaughn’s films are to appeal to his surprisingly rabid fan-base, the more they seem custom-built to repel everyone else.","20","2802144"
"570","Those audiences who have complained about the clunky exposition and mawkish emotional dialogue in Cameron's films will discover the ""King of the World""'s own dramatic talents to be on par with the Bard in comparison to the shouty, over-emoted hokum on display here.","20","881320"
"571","Watching Williams as Teddy Roosevelt ogle through binoculars Sacajawea (Mizuo Peck) while she stalks around a glassed-in display like some hippie chick in a buffalo-skin straitjacket after a bad trip at Woodstock ’94 makes me sad and uncomfortable.","20","477347"
"572","Darkman is a spectacularly ill-conceived combination of Batman and The Phantom of the Opera. [24 Aug. 1990, p.6]","20","99365"
"573","Soon enough, it becomes clear how much this movie disrespects both the audience and the genre.","20","185371"
"574","This hastily-produced sequel ignores the dreamstalking premise that had made A Nightmare on Elm Street successful and reverts to the overfamiliar possession story.","20","89686"
"575","If there are Nazis fighting other Nazis in a movie and it's still boring, something's gone wrong. Valkyrie has a coterie of problems, and represents a whole new front in Tom Cruise's public relations war, but first and foremost there's the tedium.","20","985699"
"576","Its forced slapstick egregiously mugs the audience for laughs.","20","120770"
"577","If mean-spirited snarksters had set out to trash the reputation of ""Juno"" screenwriter Diablo Cody, they couldn’t have done a more vicious job than the Oscar winner herself does with her directorial debut.","20","1262990"
"578","A sickeningly manipulative, by-the-numbers revenge movie.","20","330793"
"579","I found the film -- excruciatingly flat-footed, with one of the most exasperating scores (by Philip Glass) ever written. The most fascinating thing in the movie is a nose.","20","274558"
"580","Ugh. The Rules of Attraction is the kind of movie that leaves vague impressions and a nasty aftertaste.","20","292644"
"581","Its so-called audacity smacks of calculation and emotional cowardice.","20","2584384"
"582","The parade of eccentrics never ends, and Stone's near-miraculous achievement is to drain the life right out of material so sordid you'd think it couldn't help but be interesting. A must to avoid.","20","120399"
"583","In the end the movie goes nowhere a hundred movies haven't already been and tells us nothing we don't already know. It does so with so much violent energy, however, it's like four brutal years at film school crammed into an hour and a half.","20","180093"
"584","See, everyone complains about humans in movies but no one does anything about it, so it fell to Eagle Eye to make everything laughably, ridiculously fake.","20","1059786"
"585","Forsyth's script feels uncomfortably improvised, so almost all of the performances are hesitant and unconvincing. [06 May 1994]","20","106379"

"587","Sicko horror film from Australia, whose sadism is topped only by its absurdity.","20","387564"
"588","This is nothing more than a bare-assed fart in the face of Smith's fans.","20","261392"
"589","Slow-acting poison. For the first third of the movie, you'll experience a not-unpleasant tingling in the extremities, giving way to an encroaching torpor. An hour in, your pupils will have shrunk to pinholes, and by the time the closing credits roll, you'll be capable only of a dim longing for the defibrillation paddles. Who would have thought a movie about a beautiful, frequently naked female Nazi could be so dull?","20","976051"
"590","Director-star Kevin Costner falls head over heels in love with himself in this nihilistic, post-apocalyptic clunker about a loner who becomes a reluctant sperm donor, role model and inevitably a godsend to what's left of America.","20","119925"
"591","Inexplicable Fantasy Romances for the Harried Modern Gal 101 is a more fitting title for this shameless mediocrity.","20","372532"
"592","Screenwriter Jeff Nathanson (Catch Me If You Can), taking over from series regulars Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, doesn’t make much sense out of the typically (for the franchise) convoluted plot, but does manage to bring out a father-child theme that lends the film a little emotional resonance.","20","1790809"
"593","The goofy hysteria of something like ""A Summer Place"" was infinitely more entertaining and emotionally authentic than the distant smugness of this failed clone. [7 April 1997, p. 76]","20","119381"
"594","If ever a movie signaled that the Quentin Tarantino copycat age of empty-headed wink-wink genre rehashing is still with us, Rushlights is that movie.","20","1536437"
"595","Little more than a travelogue designed to show off the grandeur of the Hermitage, with the silly actors in fancy costumes getting in the way of the paintings and sculptures on display.","20","318034"
"596","Ambitious to a fault, this cautionary fantasy about artificial intelligence has so much on its muddled mind, and so little sense of dramatic grounding, that it grows ever more preposterous before lurching to a climax that's utterly unfathomable.","20","2209764"
"597","Directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor were responsible for the delirious ""Crank"" and ""Crank 2"" but left the magic behind when they threw together this tedious mash-up of ""Tron,"" ""Rollerball,"" ""The Matrix,"" etc.","20","1034032"
"598","The comedy is forced, the drama nonexistent and the actors melt into a yapping clan that seems to go everywhere en masse — a gesticulating blob of upraised shoulders and upturned palms.","20","3760922"

"601","In this case, the adage would go something like ""material, material, material,"" also known as the Nicolas Cage Rule: Good acting can't overcome bad taste.","20","366627"
"602","I had a pretty good time with this until the end, when I felt so soiled by the filmmakers' cynicism and the characters' gratuitous viciousness that I wanted to take a bath.","20","184858"
"603","A piece of pulp claptrap; it has no insights whatsoever into totalitarian psychology and always settles for the cheesiest kinds of demagoguery and harangue as its emblems of evil. They say they want a revolution? Then give us a revolution, one that's believable, frightening, heroic, coherent and not a teenagers' freaky power trip.","20","434409"
"604","To be honest, I would be perfectly happy to walk with a zombie after ninety minutes of this; it would feel like light relief.","20","949731"
"605","If this is one small step for the actor (Efron) toward becoming a leading man, it is, for Hollywood movies, one more giant leap into infantilism.","20","974661"
"606","What played as rousingly dumb fun in ""Independence Day"" (1996) — all those pie-eyed nationalistic monologues, and U.S. landmarks reduced to rubble — now come off as callously insensitive, even with tongue firmly in cheek.","20","2334879"
"607","A film built upon transitions so weak and obvious it's astonishing the entire thing doesn't collapse on itself.","20","199725"
"608","Ugly Americans in Paris have run-ins with the native werewolf culture in this horror-for-laughs story, in which the characters' stupidity and the deadpan acting are out of sync--instead of being campy or clever, the plot and performances are just unconvincing.","20","118604"
"609","""Star Trek V"" is a shambles, a space plodessy, a snoozola of astronomic proportions. The story is uneventful, the effects warmed over from ""Star Wars.""","20","98382"

"612","The filmmakers were too busy throwing together potential blockbuster material to notice all the loose ends and gaping holes in logic. Which may, ultimately, explain why Willis looks so confused throughout. Maybe he, too, is straining to locate some intelligence amid all the machinery.","20","986263"
"613","An epic example of muddled storytelling, chintzy excitement and scatter-brained execution.","20","473075"
"614","Stinks worse than dino dung. Sure, the creatures look good.","20","163025"
"615","Nearly all the SF premises are accorded the status of Andrew Dice Clay one-liners - which means that they, along with the characters, keep changing from one scene to the next.","20","106697"
"616","Disney's National Treasure is supposed to be family-friendly, a PG-rated action adventure free of hard violence and bad language. That's admirable, to be sure, but with a friend like this a family doesn't need sleeping pills.","20","368891"

"621","Avildsen is a master at pulling populist heartstrings, Johnny Clegg provides the African music which is so essential to the movie's plot and the panoramic shots of the veldt are frequently breathtaking. But these things alone do not a good movie make.","20","105159"
"622","You can leave Days of Thunder feeling positively chafed. That clanking noise, however, comes from Robert Towne's tinny story and its malnourished characters. [27 Jun 1990, p.1]","20","99371"

"629","Shabbily photographed and raggedly assembled. Caddyshack is hanging evidence that Ramis wasn't prepared for the assignment or clever enough to fake it...Ramis proves unable to sustain a single frayed thread of plot continuity, and none of the prominent cast members -- Chevy Chase, Murray, Rodney Dangerfield and Ted Knight -- enjoys opportunities decisive enough or direction competent enough to generate a little comic momentum and help prevent the gratuitous material from falling in a stinky, dismembered heap.","20","80487"

"631","Superman IV, except for a glitzy new villain named Nuclear Man, is one of the cheesiest movies ever made. It's so grainy and grossly envisioned, it seems filmed on pulp. Superman's crystalline Arctic palace looks as if it's made of no-deposit-no-return soda bottles, and his suit of primary colors has ring around the collar.","20","94074"

"636","Astonishingly boring.","20","82405"
"637","A frozen pile of reindeer droppings. The cinematic equivalent to passing a kidney stone, Zwigoff’s unholy foray into “dark comedy” gives us a suicidal, sociopathic drunk slinging swear words with a ferocity that would make Tony Montana wince.","20","307987"
"638","I can think of only one bit of Tin Cup that's beautiful, imaginative, and different, and it lasts for only a few seconds: a speech delivered by Russo, before her character is transformed into the standard-issue cheerleader, is broken into fragments by jump cuts.","20","117918"
"639","While “Final Destination” was gimmicky enough, its sequel begins with the same flawed premise, then piles on layers of contrivances until it reaches a level of implausibility rarely seen outside of films pitting giant radioactive monsters against each other.","20","309593"
"640","Emerges as a formulaic thriller that plays more like direct-to-video fare than a megaplex-worthy feature.","20","204626"
"641","An empty, farcical blood bath that's virtually shock-free except for one preposterous plot twist.","20","130018"
"642","This overproduced romantic comedy doesn't even qualify as fluff; it's flat, featureless plastic.","20","457939"
"643","What ""Wild at Heart"" feels like is a kind of housecleaning -- a disjointed collection of images and odd snatches of ideas that the director couldn't make room for anyplace else. They have no context, and as a result, no power to thrill or disturb.","20","100935"
"644","Painfully unfunny.","20","1220628"
"645","It's dismally bad, but not remotely connected to reality, so it can't be that dangerous. In short, it won't cause blindness or hairy palms. And if the soundtrack gets a proper amount of recognition, it shouldn't damage anybody's hearing, either.","20","82509"

"647","Willing as Campbell is to Shatner-ize himself, his movie will appeal only to true believers.","20","489235"
"648","The moral discussions operate like a bad pair of elevator shoes: it's obvious that their function is to lift black-and-white melodrama into message-movie paradise. The whole film, with its steady, important-picture pacing and its bits of pseudo-profundity, is a piece of glorified banality. [14 Dec 1992, p.123]","20","104257"
"649","Maybe the worst part (there's so much to choose from) is the sight of a good actor like Edward Herrmann parading around looking like a demented quarterback, the shoulders of his suit jacket grotesquely padded. Mr. Schumacher has dressed the adorable Corey Haim in even weirder getups, jackets with pastel stripes and little outfits that resemble dresses. The vampires aren't nearly as creepy as those clothes. [6 Aug 1987, p.1]","20","93437"
"650","While Lynch ladles on the random weirdness around the edges, it is Lee who keeps the film centered, with a harrowing but poignantly sympathetic portrait of a woman's descent into horror and madness.","20","105665"
"651","Pike phones in a reprise of her Oscar-nominated “Gone Girl” performance, complete with brittle perfection and a loose screw. Fernandez can’t decide whether his rapist is a menacing thug or a sexy innocent.

"653","Experiencing this movie is a little like watching a manic-depressive's medication wear off.","20","119822"
"654","Watching this garish fiasco, I found it mildly depressing to see Streep hurdling through this gauntlet of strained whimsy, her every toothy smile and throaty chortle more affected than Sophie Zawistowski's Polish accent.","20","1230414"
"655","The Fast and the Furious is ""Rebel Without a Cause"" without a cause. The young and the restless with gas fumes. The quick and the dead with skid marks.","20","232500"
"656","It's like a cross between ""Heathers"" and ""Waiting For Guffman,"" had those movies been made by morons, for morons, and the cinematic equivalent of cow-tipping, only less graceful.","20","157503"
"657","A grisly, depraved and wholly uninvolving exercise in empty mannerism.","20","324127"
"658","All the rest of Thor's 113 minutes felt so synthetic and overfamiliar that those brief flashes of spontaneity stood out like Morse code messages from another, better movie.","20","800369"
"659","In his prime, co-writer Michael Ritchie might have turned this into a caustic Downhill Racer or Bad News Bears-style critique of professional sporting values. Director Turteltaub, on the other hand, patronises both characters and audience with daft knockabout humour, tear-jerking sentiment and racial stereotyping which skates on very thin ice.","20","106611"
"660","You can always tell when filmmakers get their ideas from watching other movies. First-time writer David Congalton must be a Christopher Guest fan, because his derivative mockumentary feels like the work of someone who’s seen “Waiting for Guffman” and “Best in Show” too many times.","20","2114461"
"661","Only Billy Connolly, as the boys’ way-of-the-gun pa, brings a smidgen of sobering gravitas to the proceedings, though he can hardly counter the pounding hangover brought on by all the mock-virtuous butchery.","20","1300851"
"662","But basketball … basketball doesn’t deserve the Ferrell treatment. Basketball is a sport of kings, a thing of beauty and elegance, America’s game. Which doesn’t mean that it shouldn’t be mocked but that if it must be mocked it deserves to be mocked well, and Semi-Pro, unfortunately, isn’t up to the challenge.","20","839980"
"663","The cast looks sound enough—John Goodman as Fred Flintstone, Elizabeth Perkins as Wilma, Rick Moranis and Rosie O'Donnell as the Rubbles—but the script, cobbled together by a crowd of writers, gives them nothing but a handful of limp gags.","20","109813"
"664","Hopelessly overwrought and deeply dopey movie.","20","120616"
"665","There may be no more unexpected (or damning) faint praise for David Ayer’s new movie Bright than this: It made me wish I was watching “Suicide Squad” instead.","20","5519340"
"666","A numbing combination of sloppy writing, vulgar art direction, high school acting, and bungled special effects—in short, par for the course for venerable hack Michael Anderson.","20","74812"
"667","Beloved has an almost gut-wrenching quality to it. But the same can't be said for the movie overall--it's a noble, ambitious failure, but a failure nonetheless.","20","120603"
"668","The only aspects marking The Back-Up Plan as modern (not fresh) are its skanky wallowings in hormonal urges and an equally sour penchant for potshots at the target audience: women who want to be mothers.","20","1212436"
"669","Don't bother to see this film unless you expect to be tested in film class about the Coens' serial dissertation on American cinema. [10 Mar 1994, p.A16]","20","110074"
"670","Style over substance doesn’t really tell the half of it: you can bathe a corpse in groovy light and dress it in an expensive suit, but in the end that rotting smell just won’t go away.","20","1602613"
"671","Something between an indiscretion and an atrocity.","20","315327"
"672","Spasms of highfalutin philosophy, and howlingly pretentious dream sequences, serve only as the thinnest of veneers for incessant action in one of the most assaultive movies ever made.","20","2975590"
"673","Director Griffin Dunne lacks a clear vision, torn between blithe spirits and brimstone, between madcap and macabre. But then what does it matter when there's so little magic on screen anyhow? That is unless you count making audiences disappear.","20","120791"
"674","Stereotype-based comedy from Eddie Murphy in a variety of fat suits is just not enough to make a decent film.","20","477051"
"675","The result is a comedy of errors. Errors, yes. Comedy . . . we're not so sure.","20","118655"
"676","The makers of Godzilla obviously devoted so much manpower and time and energy and money to the admittedly fabulous special effects that they apparently had no budget left over for actors.","20","120685"
"677","This is one of those sadistic exercises that puts its characters through the wringer without saying anything true or meaningful.","20","831884"
"678","You really have to screw it up to dishonor the memory of a movie as shitty as the original ""Friday the 13th."" Heads should roll.","20","758746"
"679","Tired and formulaic.","20","120696"
"680","It may be too much to ask for anything more, but, on the other hand, if you’re going to go to the trouble of pretending to blow up the White House, you might also want to pretend that something was at stake.","20","2302755"
"681","Disappointing only because its best moments are transcendent; its worst moments, sadly, are just so ordinary.","20","209958"
"682","Berg may be adhering to the basic facts, but his movie’s childish machismo is a disgrace to all involved.","20","1091191"
"683","A lot of it's real pretty, the colors and creatures and all, but these days, you know, every movie is pretty pretty. I guess the only thing that kept me glued to my seat was the gum somebody'd stuck on the upholstery. [16 July 1984, p.71]","20","88323"
"684","Colombiana is one long megayawn; I'd have garnered more titillating thrills rewatching freckle-faced Russkie sexbomb Natalya Rudakova strut her leggy, sassy stuff in Megaton and Besson's ""Transporter 3.""","20","1657507"
"685","John, John, John -- one more bad-guy role in a bad movie and you're going to need another comeback.","20","244244"
"686","Wallis is commendably restrained and Alfre Woodard adds class as Mia’s wise ally. But Annabelle is a vortex of visual clichés beyond rescue.","20","3322940"
"687","The Phantom Menace is simply a billboard for itself. Anyone who sees it will be experiencing it for the second time. The hype was not about the movie, the hype was the movie.","20","120915"
"688","Third Person is a work of staggering trash; an ensemble drama with the aesthetic of an in-flight magazine, but less classy writing.","20","2343793"
"689","Enough is a very bad film and so was “Sleeping with the Enemy,” but at least that film had a first act.","20","278435"
"690","Utterly ridiculous, the dialogue exquisitely dumb, the acting soooo bad, it's one for cheap laughs.","20","95444"
"691","Extravagant in movie terms but stingy in emotional ones, it embodies all of Spielberg's bad impulses and almost none of his good ones: It's a grand display of how well he knows how to work us over, and yet the desperation with which he tries to get to us is repulsive.","20","407304"
"692","As cinematic Armageddons go, this one is a real bust...Although it succeeds in crudely outlining the fable of a magic toy box and the demonic secrets carried down in the bloodline of its inventor, it is otherwise incoherent and (except for Mr. Bradley's Pinhead) wretchedly acted. Farewell, Pinhead and company. You won't be missed.","20","116514"
"693","The Losers is simply a lot of low blows, telegraphed each and every time.","20","480255"
"694","About halfway through you'll get an incredible hunger to see a movie.","20","349903"
"695","Full of sound and fury, signifying absolutely nothing, End of Days is the loudest and least of the year's end-of-the-world movies.","20","146675"
"696","Clooney has littered his film with such a high quantity of mistakes that it is hard to know where exactly to begin finding fault.","20","433383"
"697","In all candor, and with all the amity I can muster, Divergent is as dauntingly dumb as it is dauntingly long.","20","1840309"
"698","One of the least entertaining satires ever made.","20","215545"
"699","I like watching snakes eat mice just as much as the next fella, maybe even more, but The Strangers turns the gobble-'em-up into an ordeal. It's a fraud from start to finish.","20","482606"
"700","After almost twenty five years, the Halloween series has been reduced to a false alarm. ...the characters are so devoid of human feeling they accomplish the task of making us not wish they were dead, but just gone.","20","220506"
"701","Has warmed-over chills and a muddled, zombie-like execution.","20","455407"
"702","One of the problems is that King usually writes about cliche subjects so well that you don’t notice the hackneyed aspects of his books, and so when all the character detail, precise backgrounding and elaborate plot setting-up mechanisms are pruned away, all you get is a dumb TV movie with characters doing insanely stupid things to prolong the agony.","20","98084"
"703","The book’s subtitle was “A Tale of Deadly Obsession in the Amazon,” and the film gets that part wrong. It’s deadly dull and conspicuously short on obsessiveness.","20","1212428"
"704","Sad excuse for a movie. [4 Aug 1986, p.C6]","20","91080"
"705","Sucks -- because it's a frenetic bore that insists on its audience's adoration while making no demands upon their intelligence.","20","211915"
"706","The animals are often caught in a stare as if they, too, are looking for the tale that Anderson forgot.","20","432283"
"707","Mini is too tame for Skina-max and too inane to survive on the art-house circuit. It's a pretentious erotic thriller that gives honest trash a bad name.","20","425253"
"708","The Change-Up's spin on the material transplants the same old house on a crumbled foundation, trying to disguise its creaky familiarity with the gaudiest coat of paint possible.","20","1488555"
"709","The annoying Reg Rogers, on the other hand, who plays Little Caesar creator Raoul Berman, delivers his lines like a stoned Pee-wee Herman, and the scene in which Billy Crystal mutters and drools in a restaurant is just disturbing for anyone who admired his work in the past.","20","289848"
"710","It's all probably too slippery for the youngest viewers to grasp and too sketchy for the nostalgia crowd (for whom this revival seems most geared).","20","453556"
"711","Should be immediately screened in film schools across the world as a shining example of everything that is wrong with the American studio system and the increasingly dreadful junk it produces.","20","1053424"
"712","It's still trash.","20","83972"
"713","Berlinger’s latest film attempts to reckon with the legacy of a brutal murderer who cynically cultivated his public image to make himself seem more alluring, but the story fails to dig in to the horrifying implications of how Bundy was able to succeed.","20","2481498"
"714","The worst sin of omission in Secret Window is the removal of the fact that Rainey had actually plagiarized in the past. In the story, this is critical because it is the source of Rainey’s guilt -– and arguably the reason for his success.","20","363988"
"715","If they gave out badges for smutty language, this movie would have lots. There’s nothing wrong with that. But filthy doesn’t automatically equal funny.","20","2702724"
"716","There's nothing but a convoluted overcast of story with a monsoon of bad dialogue.","20","118661"
"717","The result is a revisionist fiasco, too dense with Shakespeare allusions for casual moviegoers, and too fast and loose with the facts for those who know a thing or two about the man. In short, All Is True takes the English language’s most gifted dramatist and reduces his sunset years to a sloppy soap opera.","20","9206798"
"718","The Box is its own kind of awful, a disconnected mess that never finds its reason for being.","20","362478"
"719","A ticket to Pretty Woman buys you mechanical titillation and predictable twists... Old-fashioned, assembly-line moviemaking without the old panache. [2 Apr 1990, p.70]","20","100405"
"720","Soon becomes a sadistic experience in its own right. Experiencing this pretentious wallow -- overwritten, under-thought and overdone -- is a very sophisticated form of torture.","20","180073"
"721","It’s just blinkered middle-class pandering at its most shameless.","20","878804"
"722","The Equalizer is a stone-dumb movie.","20","455944"
"723","So what's not to like? There's the bad CGI, the choppy pacing, the comically intense acting, the repetition, the dullness and mostly the idiot plot about how there's only one male dragon and everything will be fine if they kill the Big Dick. Wha? Somebody get a hose and put this Fire out.","20","253556"
"724","Mr. Holland's Opus is the kind of movie that only a person who really doesn't like movies could love. It's a movie whose grandiose swagger is meant as compensation for its message about the resignation of the human spirit to smaller gratifications and vistas.","20","113862"
"725","It seems almost impossible that someone could vulgarize and coarsen Tom Wolfe's best-selling novel, but leave it to director Brian De Palma, working here with a script by Michael Cristofer, to plumb uncharted depths.","20","99165"
"726","A clunking underdog/redemption sports movie with a horribly perfunctory and unconvincing script, and a ponderous, half-awake performance from the bearded and stolid Ben Affleck.","20","8544498"
"727","Check the credits: That move is ripped straight from producer Michael Bay's playbook.","20","1464540"
"728","On the bright side, Ivan Reitman's disappointing new comedy isn't just cheap and formulaic, but so forgettable few people will even remember she (Portman) was in it.","20","1411238"
"729","In the end, it isn't so much that the New Arthur isn't the Old Arthur. Rather it's the anti-Arthur.","20","1334512"
"730","Watching Oliver Stone's Wall Street is about as wordy and dreary as reading the financial papers accounts of the rise and fall of an Ivan Boesky-type arbitrageur.","20","94291"
"731","Lurches on for the better part of two hours with a ludicrous plot and even worse dialogue, interspersed with what look like excerpts from a music video made by some naughty Catholic-school graduates.","20","145531"
"732","One well-staged sequence in a parking garage is the film's only memorable moment","20","804461"
"733","An effective sound design enhances several of the film's sudden frights, and Sutherland, who appears in almost every scene, is a predictably solid presence.","20","790686"
"734","On paper, fine; on celluloid, a Rocky Horror Show of nightmarish proportions.","20","120879"
"735","To be sure, Hitman is a lousy film, but like the video game that inspired it, it's also great fun, drawing as it does on everything from James Bondian Eurotrash panache to Vin Diesel's moribund XXX character.","20","465494"
"736","Creatively it's a giant step backwards.","20","1045778"
"737","Affleck and impressively amazonian Alias star Jennifer Garner (as the ninjitsu-savvy daughter of a wealthy tycoon) are lankier than ""Spider-Man's"" Maguire and Dunst, which is good if you like lanky, but their relationship substitutes cliché for chemistry.","20","287978"
"738","Smith is only a rogue computer program, but this morbidly dispiriting movie makes him sound like a prophet.","20","242653"
"739","Maguire has the nerve to give her heroine a big speech on the “integrity” of proper journalism — this after Bridget Jones’s Baby has made fun of foreigners’ names, and arranged for her to put the wrong Asian guest in front of the cameras. (Do all Asians look alike to her? Is that the joke?) So reliably does she embarrass herself at every public event that the film, trudging by on automatic, becomes an embarrassment, too.","20","1473832"
"740","Though the superhero's fans have long awaited his close-up, the Devil's bounty hunter -- complete with a burning skull for a head and a killer motorcycle in flames --materializes in a movie that never measures up to his infernal potential.","20","259324"
"741","This Ed Wood is dead wood.","20","109707"
"742","The only thing Schumacher and his scrupulous craftsfolk forgot to give the movie was life -- the energizing spirit of wit and passion that makes scenes work and characters breathe.","20","112462"
"743","The Boxtrolls feels rough-and-tumble and not as much fun by half.","20","787474"
"744","Virtually unendurable.","20","119173"
"745","Craven's name doesn't appear anywhere in the credits of the film otherwise known as They. That's fitting, too, since even the worst Craven-directed movies have a lot more going for them than this painfully familiar bit of oogum-boogum.","20","283632"

"747","As an audience member, you end up feeling like a sucker for even having tolerated that sickly sweet notion about a father, a son, and their silly radio.","20","186151"
"748","Channeling your inner child, you may find solace in Hotel Transylvania 2, but in the end it has no bite, doing continued disservice to the Universal monsters it scabs out, and adding another soiled feather to Sandler’s cap of mediocrity.","20","2510894"
"749","Basically a theme-park version of a tawdry tradition.","20","1126591"
"750","A peerless indignity, a club-footed vomit launch of teen-horror clichés, overproduced self-importance, and scareless gore.","20","229260"
"751","Since Equilibrium shamelessly rips off every Orwellian science fiction thriller in film history, what other reason is there besides sheer desperation for the film to be so stupidly violent?","20","238380"
"752","It's not the implausibility of its plot, the shallowness of its characters, its funereal pace, its tenuous understanding of teenage behavior, its commercial-ready TV-movie-style direction, or the fact that Pfeiffer and Williams may be the most implausible Italian-Americans since James Caan -- the film is most undone by its near-complete lack of genuine drama.","20","120646"
"753","Wolfgang Petersen and writer Andrew Marlowe, apparently afraid to really make fun of any American icons, challenge us to take the story straight no matter what, but the only thing this ponderous movie has going for it is its unintentional humor.","20","118571"
"754","The scenes have no fire or lightness and sometimes they are embarrassing. ... Sachs is such a talented film-maker, but this is a baffling misstep.","20","8019694"
"755","Spanglish is Brooks' unqualified kitchen disaster - a desperate, shapeless, overreaching big-screen sitcom of a movie that just wants to be loved. Is that so wrong?In a word, yes.","20","371246"
"756","It's exactly like ""Star Wars"" -- if you subtract a good story, sympathetic characters, intelligence, wit and moral purpose.","20","120201"

"758","How do I count the ways this movie goes wrong?","20","1067583"
"759","It's a ponderous, plodding, visually dull picture, but the blame shouldn't be put on Snyder's skills per se, and has nothing to do with his ambition to blur the distinction between CGI and photography. Frankly, it's the slavish, frame-by-frame devotion to Miller's source material that's the problem.","20","416449"
"760","Should be shot at sunrise. Or strung up by the neck from a tall tree. Or at least run out of town by a big posse.","20","244000"
"761","An overstuffed failure that mistakes sleight storytelling for dazzling entertainment.","20","844286"
"762","Unfortunately, the whole movie seems constructed just to get the singer/actress into a knock-down catfight, shoehorning one of show business's sexiest entertainers into a scorned-woman role. And even then, the pay-off feels cheap.","20","1198138"
"763","Every composite shot in Superman III appears to be a careless affront to the willing suspension of disbelief. The flying sequences are a letdown, the cataclysms are a cheat, and even the settings are often exposed as a chintzy hoot. [17 June 1983, p.C1]","20","86393"
"764","Like most other members of an excellent cast that includes James McAvoy, Kevin Kline and Tom Wilkinson, she (Robin Wright) has come under the deadening directorial hand of Robert Redford.","20","968264"

"769","Johnny Depp's impersonation of the Thompson figure is effective up to a point, but it's hard to imagine any segment of the public embracing this off-putting, unrewarding slog through the depths of the drug culture.","20","120669"
"770","To its credit, the film's costume design is stunning. But unless you have a kimono fetish, there's no reason to pay a good dollar (or a yen, for that matter) on this junk.","20","397535"

"773","Once again, the overall premise is milked for some mild titillation involving the hero's sexual innocence, making one wonder if the genre's popularity might involve some deeply sublimated form of kiddie porn--arguably the distilled ideological essence of squeaky-clean Reaganism.","20","94737"
"774","Overall, Charlie Wilson's War is glib rather than witty, one of those films that comes off as being more pleased with itself than it has a right to be. It also suffers from being not all of a piece, with mismatched elements struggling to cohere.","20","472062"
"775","The most subtly revolting aspect of the movie is how it manages to exploit violence for cheap thrills, in part by equating submission with love.","20","188453"
"776","If you find yourself at ""The Island"" I have only three words of advice: Vote yourself off.","20","399201"
"777","Harsh-voiced Sarah Butler lends zero personality to her avenging antiheroine, and the retributive torture sequences approach ""Saw"" levels of unlikelihood.","20","1242432"

"779","For all but the most forgiving horror fans, this is a lazy, stupid and incoherent failure.","20","2226417"
"780","The plot, the gags, the action are so stupid and strident, so unfunnily parodic, that the film's only interest is in wondering how they did it-the mix of animation and live action. [1 Aug 1988]","20","96438"
"781","Estevez and Nelson are as unappealing here as in The Breakfast Club, though in fairness they're hampered by a script that seems to despise its characters. So, by the end, will you.","20","90060"
"782","A Garry Marshall movie has to be funny in order to be anything at all, and this one is so deeply involved with its pseudo-meaningful roundelay of beautiful but inexplicably lovelorn people as to be teeth-grindingly, mind-warpingly boring.","20","817230"
"783","It’s important to note that Breathe was produced by the Cavendishes’ son Jonathan, who co-owns a production company with Serkis. I suppose not everyone sees their parents for the flawed humans that they are, but in this case, things would be a lot more interesting if they did.","20","5716464"
"784","Even John C McGinley (Dr. Cox from Scrubs) can't save this lamest of comedies.","20","422774"
"785","With its eye-popping color palette and surreal sense of ever-heightening melodrama, Thunderbirds comes across as ""Spy Kids'"" poorer British cousin.","20","167456"

"804","A grimy mess set among L.A.'s speed-abusing ""tweakers,"" Salton has neither the substance to justify first-time feature director D.J. Caruso's pretentious flourishes, nor the skill to make those flourishes work on their own terms.","20","235737"
"805","There is hardly any point in discussing the direction of a picture like this, in which almost every shot has been predetermined by the requirements of the special effects, yet director Richard Marquand fluffs the two or three real opportunities he has, rendering the long-delayed character climaxes with a chilly indifference.","20","86190"
"806","I just really, really, really, don't like this movie, and I don't care who knows it.","20","145660"
"807","Meet Joe Black takes an interesting idea--Death assumes human form and comes to earth to learn about human existence--and reduces it to a flat, uninspired, interminably slow movie.","20","119643"
"808","It’s slow, lethargic, utterly lacking in charm and undeserving of the Cold War setting that is its best trait.","20","1638355"
"809","Movie stars may be less valued than they used to be, but it's still puzzling to see Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts stuck in a romantic comedy as flat-footed and tone deaf as Larry Crowne.","20","1583420"
"810","It seems as if every possible cliche and story twist from any seafaring picture of the past 80 years made its way into this flick.","20","311113"
"811","It's sheer piffle, a disingenuous romance with Val Kilmer and Mira Sorvino that's all sap and no sizzle.","20","132512"
"812","Poor Roberts, pretty and perky as the day is long, hasn't a hoot in hell of bringing Julianne off. She's simply not actress enough, she doesn't have that suppleness that would enable her to sell the complexity of emotion, the jealousy, the irrationality, the meanness and the intelligence.","20","119738"
"813","Mendelsohn's villain is boringly one-note, Eve Hewson's Marion uses an incongruous Yank accent and always looks as though she's just stepped out of the makeup trailer, F. Murray Abraham swans around in fancy cardinal's vestments looking sinister and Foxx seems pissed off that he's not somewhere, perhaps anywhere, else. As for Egerton, he's a boy doing a man's job.","20","4532826"
"814","Nothing in John Carter really works, since everything in the movie has been done so many times before, and so much better.","25","401729"
"815","A slick, supercharged popcorn flick of the erstwhile Bruckheimer-Simpson brigade in which the only thing more shameful than the proceedings is a very well-paid male star assigned to make you less aware of that sucking sound.","25","144214"
"816","The funny scenes are as far apart as oases in the Sahara. [22 May 1987]","25","93278"
"817","The film saddles Craig T. Nelson with the generally thankless role of Paxton's cold, distant dad. But when he feels like the only person who doesn't understand what's going on with Tate and his son, you feel like saying, ""No, me too.""","25","1041829"
"818","The result, in the case of Moonrise Kingdom, is what I call transcendentally brainless - an after school special aimed at asinine adolescents over the age of 40.","25","1748122"
"819","Life as a House mounts a brutally insensitive attack on its audience's sensitivities.","25","264796"
"820","As released, All the Money in the World is by and large a conspicuously manufactured thriller that moves between manipulative psych-outs.","25","5294550"
"821","More than the usual bad or even numbingly horrible movie. It's an amalgam of many of the modern cinema's worst tendencies and modern filmmaking's most unfortunate misconceptions.","25","383574"
"822","It's two hours of your life wasted, time once spent that can never be regained. Don't go. Don't do it. [30 Mar 1988]","25","94721"
"823","As he showed in the recent ""Catch Me if You Can,"" also a Hanks vehicle, Spielberg has little talent for emotional realism, not to mention psychological suspense. He should scurry back to ""Jurassic Park"" as soon as the next flight leaves.","25","362227"

"830","No matter how you dissect it, Clash of the Titans will never, ever be a serious motion picture.","25","800320"
"831","The movie chides us for being a sick voyeuristic society, hungry for the sight of violence. The purity of this moral stance is somewhat clouded by the movie's habit of staging sick violent acts.","25","880578"
"832","The first thing director Roland Emmerich should do after his latest movie Midway hits theaters is apologize. Apologize to the visual effects crew, the stuntmen, the carpenters, the costumers and artists. He has squandered their considerable visual skill in retelling the crucial World War II battle at Midway by melding some of the best action sequences in years with the most banal of words.","25","6924650"
"833","So needlessly convoluted, so crammed with subplots within subplots, it simply forgets about its gangland ""Romeo & Juliet"" premise.","25","165929"
"834","Yet the moral at the end is that we should all be more tolerant of different cultures. Is that really true, though, if the culture you're trying to tolerate is trying to open your skull with a circular saw?","25","762125"
"835","Scrooged is so monumental a mess that even rabid Bill Murray fans - the ones who'll stand in line to see it despite critics' inevitable bashings - will wonder how it went so wrong. [23 Nov 1988, p. 9D]","25","96061"
"836","Richard Brooks made a tougher and much better film about the tragedy of compulsive gambling in his 1985 film ""Fever Pitch,"" and in 1949’s ""The Lady Gambles,"" even Barbara Stanwyck made a more convincing fall from respectability into casino hell than Mark Wahlberg does here.","25","2039393"
"837","The film moves from cliché to cliché and hemorrhages blood and logic at an alarming rate.","25","476964"
"838","Everything connected with the lovers, who are the point of the movie, is either ordinary or unwittingly funny, and the laughs come early.","25","375154"
"839","No better than whatever you might pick up while wearing a blindfold at Blockbuster, even if you happen to reach into a trash can.","25","369226"
"840","An hour and 20 minutes into this two-hour-and-11-minute endurance test, a hungry Kaiju attacks the city of Hong Kong and eats the neon signs of every Cantonese restaurant in Victoria Harbor. It’s sort of worth waiting around for.","25","1663662"
"841","The more I try to find some kind of justifiable meaning and relevance, the more I find The Shape of Water a loopy, lunkheaded load of drivel. Not as stupid and pointless as that other critically overrated piece of junk ""Get Out,"" but determined to go down trying. I call this one ""Maudie Meets the Creature From the Black Lagoon.""","25","5580390"
"842","So what is real? Only the boredom of the audience as the film collapses from one meaningless false-bottom environment to the next.","25","139809"
"843","The Thing Called Love should have been a nice, middle-key romance, with a few gentle digs at Nashville's fevered, wildly competitive country-music scene. Instead, it's a hapless, well-intentioned mess -- running in half a dozen directions at once, looking half-planned and semi-improvised, and featuring a skittish, overly mannered performance by Phoenix. [16 March 1994, p.E1]","25","108327"
"844","If your answer to the question ""When are rape jokes funny?"" is anything aside from ""never,"" the good news is that you may still find a lot to hoot over throughout the film.","25","2170439"

"847","Except for the relentless, jittery way that the film has been photographed, there's nothing of interest going on in it. It's all fractious guerrilla-newsreel ""style"" masquerading a void.","25","1217613"
"848","Self-serious, pointless and silly.","25","238546"
"849","A tasteless and incredibly undercooked serving of the internet’s stalest Creepypasta, Slender Man aspires to be for the YouTube era what “The Ring” was to the last gasps of the VHS generation...there’s one fundamental difference that sets the two movies apart: “The Ring” is good, and Slender Man is terrible.","25","5690360"
"850","A shamelessly commercial and determinedly vulgar director, such as Flash Gordon's Mike Hodges, might have made the film work; it might have succeeded on one level instead of failing on many. [13 Dec 1980, p.E7]","25","81353"
"851","Salt is about as believable as a secret training program for military pilots consisting entirely of kangaroos in flight helmets. But it must be said that the star carries her load admirably.","25","944835"

"854","If plots were people, this obese thing would be cuing up for liposuction. Mr. Brooks may well boast the greediest yarn in the annals of filmdom. One serial killer just doesn't cut it – no fewer than four, actual and potential, pack these frames.","25","780571"
"855","Despite a lavish budget and one of the most expensive movie sets in the world--the island of Manhattan—they (Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen) can’t buy love, talent, or a decent script.","25","363282"
"856","Yet, it's watchable -- not remotely enjoyable, but watchable.","25","386140"
"857","Queasily suspended between drag theatrics (Faye Dunaway and Brenda Vaccaro camping it up on a soundstage replica of a carnival spook house) and Spielbergian wholesomeness (Canadian Helen Slater as a toothy, Aryan Ubermadchen), this is one comic-book feature that doesn't fly.","25","88206"

"860","The Distinguished Gentleman isn't much of a movie - it's a mess, in fact. [04 Dec 1992]","25","104114"
"861","This poor excuse for a thriller turns, with a great crunching of gears, into a mess of a buddy comedy. Either way, it misfires.","25","163579"
"862","Too conventional to function as shock comedy and too angry to spark spontaneous laughs, The Comedian is a film without a purpose.","25","1967614"
"863","It's impossible to even laugh at Inferno given how Ron Howard reduces the material to a dull spectacle of earnest puzzle-solving.","25","3062096"

"870","That closing-credits sequence is by far the funniest thing in the disappointing movie,","25","452625"
"871","In short, there are an awful lot of subplots and comic characters but none of the actors in this star-studded cast is allowed to build his laughs and the Coens just abandon several of these vivid personalities along the way.","25","475290"
"872","The film suffers from a severe lack of urgency and emotional engagement. You can't get involved in a movie in which the characters all seem to be harboring double identities.","25","1243957"
"873","No, it's the movie itself -- an unimaginative, generic affair memorable only for its incessant and flagrant plugging of Apple computers and iPods -- that should put a stake through the franchise for good.","25","359013"
"874","This is a Happy Madison production, and as such it's exhaustively lazy, outside of its righteous dedication to the valorization of the man-child.","25","2120120"

"883","Star Trek III or The Search for Schlock: a mission that renders the eyelids heavy. What else can you say about a movie whose mechanically inept, gelatinous monsters out-act everyone on the screen and whose poignant moments are simply guffawful. Not to put too fine a Vulcan point on it, it was ba-a-a-d. [2 June 1984]","25","88170"
"884","Safe House is an idea for a movie. It's a few blustery gestures in the direction of a story, with five good actors doing their best, trying to hold up the barest frame of an idea, while investing the surrounding emptiness with all the truth they can muster.","25","1599348"
"885","Thus, we find ourselves watching an ice-cold movie about competition that contains not a shred of rooting interest.","25","482571"
"886","To call Death to Smoochy satire -- or parody, burlesque, or even lampoon -- would be too generous. The moviemakers merely glide on the thin ice of yesterday's cynicism.","25","266452"
"887","Moves at a lumbering pace, peppered with ungainly gags and dramatic moments with little emotional power. The ironic commentary on show-biz superficiality is sabotaged by Niccol's failure to make his own story seem real.","25","258153"
"888","A long-winded indulgence in tear-and-a-smile whimsy, elevated above the merely irritating and saccharine by compelling art direction.","25","319061"
"889","The movie is pretty bad, all right. But it has a certain charm. It's so completely wrong-headed from beginning to end that it develops a doomed fascination.","25","139414"
"890","There's are nagging problems with the script, which feels like it has lost a few pages during its rewrites. Instead of an orderly, inexorable pressure of events, we get a surfeit of red herrings, followed by the rather uninteresting killer simply stepping out of hiding.","25","112722"
"891","The Cable Guy doesn't know when to pull the plug. Much of the film plays like a personal boob tube with Carrey trapped inside, determined to act his way out in a mugging freak show. He's a disturbing mixture of psychopath and pathetically misguided lonely soul.","25","115798"
"892","With such a large cast, none of the actors is able to turn her character into a fully realized person.","25","1405500"

"898","Astonishingly (and offensively), the witless ending comes down harder on the women than the cad.","25","455967"
"899","Holbrook—a Garrett Hedlund-Charlie Hunnam hybrid—at least delivers the tough-guy one-liners Black specializes in with the right combination of sincerity and bemusement (even better is Sterling K. Brown as a government agent). But in the mouths of pretty much everyone else in the cast—including Trevante Rhodes, Thomas Jane, and Keegan-Michael Key—the dialogue falls flat.","25","3829266"
"900","For the most part, Tombstone is inept. Some of the performances are wincingly bad: Dana Delany, playing a touring actress with the hots for Wyatt, is particularly embarrassing. Director George P. Cosmatos (Leviathan) firmly cements his hack status: He takes nearly an hour to get things rolling, then fails to build any sort of momentum. [25 Dec 1993, p.F1]","25","108358"

"904","Despite its sometimes bloody content, the mood of Happy Death Day is remarkably sappy, aimed at the broadest possible audience for a film of its genre. Think of it as “slasher lite” and an acceptable date movie for unadventurous types, and you have the gist of it.","25","5308322"
"905","Not only is it plodding and completely predictable, the carnage is rendered slowly and quasi-reverentially, making the whole brutal experience come off like torture porn.","25","844708"
"906","Cage and Baruchel work hard to stay accessible, but the computer-generated effects come on like heavy artillery blowing away any hint of flesh and blood. The Sorcerer's Apprentice should be rated U for Untouched by Human Hands.","25","963966"

"929","What can you say about a film the comic high point of which is Dan Aykroyd standing half-naked in a bathroom while extracting hairs from his nostrils with manicure scissors? For starters you can say it's bad, as bad as a film can be that looksto National Lampoon's Vacation for creative inspiration. [17 June 1988]","25","95253"

"931","Butter is a misfire. At 90 minutes it feels inflated, and though clearly intended as funny, it's difficult to locate, except in the most general terms, the focus of the movie's satire, and there's not a laugh to be had.","25","1349451"

"935","The film will probably play a lot better in dorm rooms with plenty of beer kegs and bongs on hand, but in the confines of a movie theater, it's deadly - the sort of bad comedy Mel Brooks made late in his career, until he finally smartened up and quit.","25","1240982"

"940","Besides a lot of scenic driving in and around Calgary, Nightbreed does have its fair share of sound and fury, not to mention blood and entrails. But it plays as if Barker were making it up as he went along, despite the film's having been based on his own novel Cabal.","25","100260"
"941","Compared to other summer blockbusters, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie is as cheesy as the TV show. The computer animations are second-rate, the sets are theme-park attraction quality. [30 June 1995, p.6G]","25","113820"
"942","The film is confusing and awkwardly timed, and it drags.","25","1341188"
"943","Somehow, the funny stuff gets sucked into a kind of black hole in the center of the satire, along with all the comic debris. What should have been a surreal flight to the planet Lucas crumbles into a harmless collection of cosmic dustballs. [24 Jun 1987, p.52]","25","94012"

"948","Above The Law is beneath contempt, a movie whose esthetic politics stand somewhere to the right of tyrannosaurus rex.You know the type.

"952","Mr. Nobody is simply a failure.","25","485947"
"953","I admit, I jumped a couple of times in the beginning, but as the movie progressed, it lost its horror and picked up its stupidity. [20 Aug 1993, p.21]","25","107254"
"954","There’s really nothing else to say about Gold, beyond one general point: It is illustrative of what’s particularly fun about being a critic in January. For most of the year, bad movies have the same general ailments. But in January, they have exotic diseases. They have things wrong with them that you’ve never seen before.","25","1800302"
"955","You've seen it all before, ad nauseum: Myers' face reflected in a windowpane, Myers appearing in deep focus over the shoulder of an oblivious victim, a strung-up body swinging from an overhang into the path of a screaming character (the Shape has a flair for the dramatic) and lots and lots of screaming characters. [4 Oct 1995, p.51]","25","113253"
"956","Imagine a movie where every character is more self-centered than Ted Baxter in ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" of old, add a caboodle of idiotic jokes, and you have some idea of this ugly, unfunny farce.","25","357413"
"957","Desperately unfunny.","25","257106"
"958","Vox Lux sets up its main character as a beneficiary of tragedy, opening up a compellingly macabre narrative about how school shootings are becoming so commonplace that they can effectively serve as launchpads for stardom. But that idea goes nowhere, as Vox Lux proceeds to play Celeste's experience in the music industry mostly straight.","25","5960374"

Perhaps not, but as one of its most egregious and fallacious examples, it's as good a line to draw in the sand as any.","25","2404425"

"964","When a movie sets out to be awful and achieves its goal, does that make it a success?","25","138510"
"965","Too bad it's hog-tied by a ridiculously familiar plot, uneven direction and characters of such dizzying simplicity that you wish the demons would get to them just to smack some sense into their heads. [26 Sept 1983, p.D3]","25","83907"
"966","Surprisingly, the results are embarrassing. As puppetry, Team America is stilted. As satire, it's gutless and lazy. And as comedy, it barely delivers laughs.","25","372588"
"967","First-time director Steve Beck hurls a dozen ghosts and probably a million dollars' worth of prosthetic makeup at us for a full 90 minutes, but it's old hat and not a bit scary.","25","245674"
"968","The ugly, aggressive, proliferating effects were all I could begin to contend with, and trying to keep interested in them was like trying to remain interested in a loudmouth shouting in my ear.","25","116365"
"969","The most insipidly innocuous film ever made about facing mortality and living it up before passing away, The Bucket List has as much poetry and poise as its clumsy, clunky title.","25","825232"
"970","Bullock does her damndest to be nerdy and instead becomes excruciatingly artificial - a malfunctioning verbal fun machine.","25","881891"
"971","A baseball nostalgia piece all weirded-out by flashes of supernatural horror, this early-'60s remembrance is like sitting through a double bill of Field of Dreams and The Goonies. [7 Apr 1993, p.8D]","25","108037"
"972","Blowing up bad guys, swearing, and lots of cliches makes the The Last Boy Scout a must to miss. [16 Dec 1991]","25","102266"
"973","A timid new take on the old fairy tale, and it's pretty grim.","25","1486185"
"974","No comedy this vile should be brazenly foolish enough to give itself this title. [25 November 1998, p. 3D]","25","124198"
"975","It's a film within a film about a film within a film, and seems to lose layers of authenticity with each iteration, finally becoming a profoundly alienating experience.","25","875034"
"976","In Cobb, Jones seems trapped inside his own febrile personality. He’s so utterly, hyperbolically Tommy Lee Jones that his performance doesn’t begin to register as an imaginative look at who Ty Cobb was.","25","109450"
"977","The only memorable aspect of She's Out of My League is Eve's performance. Not that it's good, but it does possess the hypnotic quality of a flicker ring.","25","815236"
"978","There is no acting to speak of (and to speak of Cruise's performance at all would be embarrassing) but there is a point of view. This is yet another Ramboesque instalment in the current American obsession with might making right. As a movie, Top Gun is negligible and near ridiculous; as a cultural phenomenon, it is sobering and faintly frightening. [16 May 1986, p.C5]","25","92099"
"979","Last Action Hero makes such a strenuous show of winking at the audience (and itself) that it seems to be celebrating nothing so much as its own awfulness. In a sense, the movie's incipient commercial failure completes it aesthetically.","25","107362"
"980","It’s far from the worst movie ever produced, but it’s a one-of-a-kind disaster, and therefore interesting.","25","385887"
"981","Two energetic and wonderfully physical comedians, each among the best of his generation. But in their movie, The Toy, they do not amount to much. Pryor seems unhappy about some of his lines and situations, and well he might. It's hard to know just what Gleason thinks, as he is able to deliver even atrocious dialogue with a misanthropic zest that is always appealing, but he has a right to be embarrassed, too. [20 Dec 1982, p.B7]","25","84809"
"982","A creepfest so stupid it makes trashy slash-and-burn epics like ""Humans Versus Zombies"" and ""I Spit on Your Grave"" seem like Molière and Proust.","25","1259521"
"983","The Conjuring is as toothless as it is because it's two different kinds of boring. The film's plot is explained exhaustively whenever loud noises aren't blaring, and random objects aren't teasingly leaping out at you from the corner of your eye.","25","1457767"
"984","Trash or treat? Halloween II is as dumb as its prequel. The Great Pumpkin isn't going to be pleased with this one. [30 Oct 1981, p.17]","25","82495"
"985","The movie inspired theater critic Judith Newmark to write a sonnet in response.","25","1521197"
"986","A blatantly telegraphed mid-film twist helps turn Second Act into one of the strangest and most misguided rom-coms of any year.","25","2126357"
"987","The film doesn't make a case for Lavoe as an important artist.","25","458522"
"988","Not to be catty about it, but the stench of the litter pan is all over this big-screen $90 million disaster-in-waiting.","25","327554"
"989","It is a very good performance in a very bad movie.","25","1242460"
"990","I'd watch the vibrant Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana in anything, but The Time Traveler's Wife is pushing it.","25","452694"
"991","Without a compelling - and convincingly compelled - character at its center, the details in this film lack an agonizing drop-by-drop tension. The various pieces fall apart like the shattered mirrors that figure in the crimes. [15 Aug 1986]","25","91474"
"992","Shrek The Third instead goes for less: fewer jokes, less energy, and toned-down characters.","25","413267"
"993","With Philomena, British producer-writer-star Steve Coogan and director Stephen Frears hit double blackjack, finding a true-life tale that would enable them to simultaneously attack Catholics and Republicans. There’s no other purpose to the movie, so if 90 minutes of organized hate brings you joy, go and buy your ticket now.","25","2431286"
"994","The movie spins further and further into coincidence and incoherence.","25","348836"
"995","Unintended laughs far, far outnumber intended thrills.","25","3181822"
"996","It's the worst kind of convoluted thriller -- it can never unravel satisfactorily because there's nothing simple at its center, just more confusion.","25","117060"
"997","Stripped of the pleasures of terror, flattened of grandeur (with a tacked-on coda that fairly groans with storytelling defeat), the movie sinks from the weight of its own heavyhandedness.","25","120184"
"998","Will I seem hopelessly square if I find Kick-Ass morally reprehensible and will I appear to have missed the point? Let’s say you’re a big fan of the original comic book, and you think the move does it justice. You know what? You inhabit a world I am so very not interested in.","25","1250777"
"999","Some of the visual horror will no doubt be of interest to genre fans, but even there the appeal is limited. In an age when we are awash in efficient and involving horror movies — from ""Halloween"" to ""A Quiet Place"" to even ""The Nun"" (which is not that great but is at least short) — Suspiria comes off as bloated and disconnected.","25","1034415"
"1000","On its own terms, the film is overlong, repetitive and lacks impact. Even if this were the first gorilla-in-love movie ever made, audiences would come away vaguely dissatisfied, suspecting there was an intriguing idea buried somewhere in here, but it didn't quite come off.","25","360717"
"1001","Overall the tone is dark and nasty, exemplified by the inelegant signature kung-fu move of the good guys -- a backward kick to the groin.","25","306685"
"1002","If it happens to hit you right - that is, if you happen to catch its wavelength of tear-and-a-smile whimsicality - the movie will speak to you.","25","845046"
"1003","In The Arrival, Charlie Sheen makes a startling discovery that, sadly, has nothing to do with the suspicion that he should have ended his flagging movie career ages ago. [31 May 1996, p.6G]","25","115571"
"1004","Aja's stomach-churning remake (produced by Craven) follows the original with frightening fidelity, amping up the barbarity from a nine (on the 1-10 scale) to a 12.","25","454841"
"1005","In Harlem Nights, Eddie Murphy continues his one-man war against the female gender. Those women he doesn't kill outright are punched, maimed and slugged with garbage cans. But apparently they deserve it-there isn't a single female character in the film who isn't a prostitute. [17 Nov 1989, p.A]","25","97481"
"1006","Too much of Jason X plays it straight, and that means boredom. Murder and mayhem of this sort quickly becomes monotonous.","25","211443"
"1007","The same covey of kids assemble at a summer camp to meet their predictable fate. Once again, their thespian talents defy assessment, since most hang around just long enough to take off the limited clothes of the American teen-ager and take on the limited role of the bloody victim - both acts performed just once, always in that order. [04 May 1981]","25","82418"
"1008","You can get away with almost anything in a farce except failing to be funny, and that's what kills Death at a Funeral.","25","1321509"
"1009","Even a supporting turn by Vincent Cassell as Otto Gross, a fellow psychiatrist, cocaine addict and unapologetic adulterer, fails to enliven the movie: A Dangerous Method makes even a cokehead hedonist boring.","25","1571222"
"1010","Shrill and sloppy film.","25","173716"
"1011","Deja vu's too kind a term to describe what happens in the latest chapter in the lives of the characters created so long ago in print by Peter Benchley and brought to life - and, eventually, to death - on screen by Steven Spielberg. [22 July 1987]","25","93300"
"1012","At last, the missing link be tween ""Phantom of the Opera"" and ""Saw."" Welcome to the gonzo revenge saga Law Abiding Citizen.","25","1197624"
"1013","RocknRolla attempts to depict a world of ever-expanding chaos. But the chaos is only in the way the story is told. The actual vision Ritchie offers is pedestrian and tame.","25","1032755"
"1014","Even as a prime example of rotten summer silliness, this is a paralyzing experience.","25","1133985"
"1015","Something so sappy, no one would believe me if I told them. It has to be seen to be disbelieved.","25","183523"
"1016","The movie sneers at the journalists covering the trial, but for those of us who followed it at the time, the newspaper accounts were a lot more engrossing than this film.","25","4645330"
"1017","The film is glossy, but awful. Frenetic, but awful. Expensive, but awful. ... And awful.","25","356910"
"1018","It's the strangest comic misfire yet from Wes Anderson.","25","362270"
"1019","So shapeless, pointless and witless a film that it can be explained only by surmising that the people who made it were bombed at the time.","25","191754"
"1020","It's unpleasant where it should be pleasant, convoluted where it should be streamlined, anxiety provoking where it should be easy, and long, long, long - at least 20 minutes longer than it has a right to be.","25","1067774"
"1021","When Christian Bale allowed himself to play Bruce Wayne in ""Batman Begins,"" he was slumming - and to good effect. But with Terminator Salvation, this ostensibly serious actor takes up residence in the action ghetto, and it's not a good fit.","25","438488"
"1022","Essentially, this is a two-person picture that falls flat.","25","8722346"
"1023","A ponderous and dreadful film.","25","307479"
"1024","Overlong, overcrowded, overstimulating and with an over-the-top performance by Charlize Theron as the evil queen Ravenna, the movie is a virtual orchard of toxic excess, starting with the unnecessarily sprawling cast of characters.","25","1735898"
"1025","A plot-twist whodunit that even Forrest Gump might crack, it's also a Hall of Fame howler from long-inactive Richard Rush, whose direction of 1967's Hell's Angels on Wheels now seems comparably placid. [19 Aug 1994, p.10D]","25","109456"
"1026","These days actors not only appear in bad movies, they are forced to produce their own flops themselves. Toni Collette and Gabriel Byrne co-executive produced Hereditary. They deserve what they get, in spades.","25","7784604"
"1027","The whole movie is so ineptly written and directed that its 90 minutes seem to take twice as long.","25","195945"
"1028","If there is a reason anyone would voluntarily agree to make this movie it probably dwells somewhere in a realm only accessible to the thinking of ambitious actors.","25","119675"
"1029","While the original conception of The Saint gave us a debonair, sophisticated and roguish detective, the new movie, directed stiffly by Phillip Noyce ( ""Clear and Present Danger"" ), gives us Val Kilmer as a greedy high-tech daredevil thief with the moves of Batman, the clunky disguises of Tom Cruise in ""Mission: Impossible"" and the morals of an alley cat.","25","120053"
"1030","The brooding RPatz doesn’t bite. But his movie does.","25","1403981"
"1031","Nicolas Cage, Ving Rhames, and Steve Buscemi are among the few performers who emerge with a shred of dignity at the end.","25","118880"
"1032","Mostly, you get a pain in the head from the assault on your senses and déjà vu as thick as heartburn after an anchovy pizza.","25","120755"
"1033","The Village seems poised to become as cheesy in its effects as a low-budget horror film. Shyamalan's gracefulness keeps his movie just out of that abyss.","25","368447"
"1034","Should have been an inaudible man movie. Every time the characters open their mouths, they hammer it deeper into the ground.","25","164052"
"1035","It's a gorefest, a borefest and a snorefest.","25","1186367"
"1036","Using a kidnapping plot to call up some old-fashioned suspense, it doesn't even get a dial tone.","25","337921"
"1037","Stoops well below substituting style for substance.","25","195714"
"1038","The movie approaches the final scene with a straight face, but it left the audience giggling spasmodically. This script probably should have gone all the way and thrown in a few quips: If your movie is a joke, at least be intentionally funny.","25","389722"
"1039","The dragon is a wimp. The knight is a geek. The king is a jerk. And, unless you're 12 or younger, the story is a bore. [31 May 1996, p.3E]","25","116136"
"1040","It's an unimaginative, mean-spirited affair that makes you hate yourself for laughing at it, and it's so devoid of anything close to wit, subtlety or sophistication that it stands as damning evidence that Hollywood has surrendered wholesale to stupidity and crassness.","25","389860"
"1041","This whole half-baked sequel is a forced exercise, willed into being by the so-called “Keanussance” — society’s renewed love affair with Reeves. He’s a nice guy and a decent actor, but he’s made a lame movie. It’ll let down even hardcore fans.","25","1086064"
"1042","One of the most anticlimactic finales I've ever seen in a movie","25","225071"
"1043","There's nothing sleazier than sleaze that fails to titillate, and this drab blight on a hot cast is as sleazy as a preordained hit ever gets. [07 Apr 1993 Pg. 08.D]","25","107211"
"1044","It’s terrible enough to torture the damned.","25","204313"
"1045","Don't go expecting an escapist night at the movies; go expecting to be cudgeled into numb, drooling submission.","25","1046173"
"1046","Someone describes his writing as ""snarky, bitter, witless."" The last part pretty well sums up this movie.","25","455538"
"1047","Seems to go out of its way to obliterate all the elements that made the original so special.","25","454082"
"1048","Better luck trying to find out what truly happened to the real Earhart than trying to diagnose all that's wrong with this hapless film.","25","1129445"
"1049","A timid thriller that manages a couple of mild jolts and a couple of creepy-cringe-worthy moments in its Variations on a ""Single White Female"" theme.","25","1265990"
"1050","There are a number of funny and unexpected moments in the film, but they are ultimately swamped by the mean-spirited tone and increasingly over-the-top raunch and drug humor.","25","175142"
"1051","Lake and Fraser never come close to believability as a romantic couple. There's more chemistry going on in a grain of salt.","25","117104"
"1052","It boggles the mind that after six years of silence, all Tarantino has to offer is this garbage.","25","266697"
"1053","Gere has never seemed more squirrelly.","25","174480"
"1054","Martha Marcy May Marlene is a strange case, a drama that's disturbing and yet inert. Writer-director Sean Durkin builds an atmosphere of dread, which means that he persuades us to believe in the characters and in the central situation. But he doesn't build interest.","25","1441326"
"1055","Hire “Dreamgirls” director Bill Condon to tell the story of Julian Assange and WikiLeaks? Sure, and next let’s hear from Lady Gaga on the Higgs boson particle.","25","1837703"
"1056","Dante gleefully trashes cliches and sentimental Capra-esque notions, but one should not forget this movie was given a ""PG"" rating and cynically aimed to draw an audience of small children who would no doubt be terrorized by this myth-shattering film.","25","87363"
"1057","Follows the imaginatively bankrupt trend of remaking slasher films from the 1970s and ’80s. This time, it’s a regurgitation of Mark Rosman’s “The House on Sorority Row.’’","25","1232783"
"1058","I Saw the Light doesn't just fail to illuminate Williams' complicated life and his prodigious talent; it can't even capture the dark corners of a man with more than enough to peer into.","25","1490785"
"1059","A standard-issue, ineptly executed serving of the genre's staples, from skeptical cops to an all-knowing psychic.","25","263488"
"1060","SWAT is better than ""Gigli,"" but so is most outpatient surgery.","25","257076"
"1061","Stargate is a time-warped implosion of baffling space mysticism, a costume budget gone mad, and too much sand for any movie short of Lawrence of Arabia. It's pretty, vacant and pointless; an interactive computer game with which we just don't feel like getting involved. [28 Oct 1994, p.10C]","25","111282"
"1062","I’d like to take back all those times I said Nicolas Cage was one of the most annoying actors on film. It turns out he’s equally terrible when he’s only on the soundtrack. And yet Cage is the least of the problems with The Croods.","25","481499"
"1063","This is the third in a hyper-violent and rather stupid series of thrillers about an adult child killer--with knives for fingers--who is burnt to death but now has returned to haunt more teenagers in their sleep. The kids are all patients at a clinic where group therapy fails to stop their nightmares. What you get for your money are scenes with a severed head, the simultaneous injection of 10 hypodermic needles presumably filled with heroin and four long tongues that turn into arm and ankle straps for a sex scene. Whoopee! The film's only blessing? It just may be bad enough to kill off the series.","25","93629"
"1064","The effort behind Bird Box was to make something better than a standard horror movie, but the result is dull and half-hearted. It’s not serious enough or important enough to transcend the horror genre, but neither is it visceral enough to hold up as a regulation horror movie.","25","2737304"
"1065","Everything is wrong pretty much from the start of this misbegotten adventure.","25","800240"
"1066","At the end of it all comes McKay’s big angry harrumph about the meaning of the crisis — a sign of failed, frustrated satire. If you can make your message clear through comedy, there’s no need to say, “Here’s my moral.” A funnyman can’t afford to get caught wagging his finger.","25","1596363"
"1067","Marc Webb’s new movie, in contrast, uses the song for its title, the name of an in-movie manuscript, and as a late-breaking song cue that doesn’t drop the needle so much as clunk it down with turgid inevitability.","25","460890"
"1068","A three-hour oration, rambling and familiar and repetitive, during which director Oliver Stone uses the assassination of John Kennedy as an elaborate pretext for delivering a dull sermon. [20 Dec 1991]","25","102138"
"1069","Vampire movies aren't what they used to be. How about a little mist, some shadows, some pale gray faces set off by stark red lips? Maestro, a little Transylvanian mood music, if you please.","25","245120"
"1070","With Hard Candy, the innocent are tortured along with the guilty -- the innocent, in this case, being the audience.","25","424136"
"1071","Wow, dudes. Pu-trid. (1989 February 20, p.4D)","25","96928"
"1072","Haphazardly conceived, phlegmatically paced, lazily filmed and punctuated with gratuitous moments of sexual and scatological slapstick.","25","480687"
"1073","The movie is heavy on shock and gimmickry, thanks to Renny Harlin's frenetic and flamboyant direction. The wafer-thin plot is little more than an excuse to showcase the astonishing achievements of special-effects makeup artists. [19 Aug 1988, p.D9]","25","95742"
"1074","The enigma of Reeves, sort of a human black hole on screen, works well in ""The Matrix"" but it drains the life from weepy romance.","25","230838"
"1075","Spike Lee's films have been provocative, blunt, thoughtful, misguided, daring, sentimental, funny, honest and silly. But 25th Hour earns the director two new adjectives: irrelevant and tedious.","25","307901"
"1076","It's obvious now that the cinematic junk routinely released every Friday can be safely categorized as a mere failure. But this alleged comedy is a whole other species entirely. This is a bona fide, absolute, unmitigated fiasco.","25","368709"
"1077","Not even within earshot of a masterpiece, Man on Fire, based on its ratio of production costs to quality alone, may prove to be the worst movie of 2004.","25","328107"
"1078","So many horror conventions are at work in After.Life that either the filmmakers are parodying them or couldn't come up with anything better. I'm betting on the second choice.","25","838247"
"1079","Too bad, though, that whenever the characters stand still to talk, Knight and Day induces stupor in the viewer.","25","1013743"
"1080","A runaway bore.","25","163187"
"1081","Its climactic highway shootout, and much else in the picture, is rendered in the best Paul Greengrass manner that Hollywood money can buy. But where Greengrass pictures aim to keep one on the edge of one's seat throughout, the tension here, such as it is, is designed to stoke audience bloodlust. If that's your kind of thing, The Kingdom certainly satisfies.","25","431197"
"1082","Unfortunately, Stuart Baird's direction is so sluggish and Jim and John Thomas' script so padded that Executive Decision has no build. Instead of focusing on the mechanics of suspense, the film concentrates to a boyish extent on mechanics, period.","25","116253"
"1083","An assault on the eyes, the ears, the brain, common sense and the human desire to be entertained.","25","120591"
"1084","The re-whatevered Conan the Barbarian feels unexpectedly low-rent, even with its multi-million-dollar backdrops and ear-splitting, rumbling soundtrack and (presumably post-converted) 3D imagery.","25","816462"
"1085","Tom Six's movie has the freakiness and sadism of its genre, but it's so heavy with self-appreciation -- Dude, we had the craziest premise for a movie! -- that it can't lift off into the perverse ecstasy of decent exploitation. That was also the problem with ""Snakes on a Plane.''","25","1467304"
"1086","The performances, the writing, the direction, Segel’s D.F.W. impression, everything is just fine. But The End of the Tour is disgraceful. It feels like it’s towing out the real Wallace’s ghost to perform some soppy parody of himself.","25","3416744"
"1087","The Smurfs is exactly like Amy Adams's princess-in-Manhattan comedy ""Enchanted,"" only far less clever, kindhearted, original, exciting or entertaining.","25","472181"
"1088","The stunts in Smokey are excellent but the comedy is numbing, and the acting is on a par with a junior high school production of Our Town. Even Gleason comes across badly, and that's a major feat. Adolph Coors and Sons must have been very happy to have a 97-minute commercial for their brew.","25","76729"
"1089","Thinking people also like a little drama with their science fiction. On that score, Annihilation comes up short.","25","2798920"
"1090","You can almost say it simulates an experience of brain injury in the audience: Nothing adheres, nothing connects. It's just nonstop cuteness, poses and emptiness - with nothing logically following from one moment to the next. It would be exaggerating to call it torture, and yet why split hairs?","25","1667307"
"1091","Shyer's version is a thing of infinite emptiness and nauseating vanity. It's not funny, alluring, affecting, or erotic, just conceited.","25","375173"
"1092","This isn’t an adaptation of a video game so much as an adaptation of a video game’s tutorial level.","25","1365519"
"1093","The deeper American Beauty tries to get, the shallower it reveals itself to be.","25","169547"
"1094","The suspense sequences are straight from the standard Hollywood blueprint, and the movie as a whole is so sloppily assembled that it's almost incoherent at times.","25","116908"
"1095","Happy End is the latest from Michael Haneke, an uncompromising filmmaker whose work is sometimes brilliant and sometimes hard to watch, and sometimes both, but not this time. Happy End is just hard to watch.","25","5304464"
"1096","It's a dismal mess...What's most grating about Hackers, however, is the guileless way the movie buys in to the computer-kid-as-elite-rebel mystique currently being peddled by magazines like Wired.","25","113243"
"1097","Clooney's stiff cornball delivery and tendency to smile during the most tragic moments bring this as close to the cartoonish Batman television series of the 1960s as any of the movies have come.","25","118688"
"1098","Vantage Point has nothing going on. There's no artistic, philosophical or even jolly entertainment reason for adopting this strategy. It's just arbitrary, a gimmick.","25","443274"
"1099","Isn't some sober history lesson that bogs down in long speeches and tedious facts. It's about style, it's about fashion, it's about rock 'n' roll busting out in medieval France.","25","151137"
"1100","To crystallize its fundamental flaw, here's a movie about Manhattan that takes 75 minutes just to get to Manhattan - followed by another 15 that could just as easily have been shot (and possibly were) in some East Topeka alley. [31 July 1989, p.4D]","25","97388"
"1101","Only Lovers Left Alive is simply dead, an exercise in style, bland humor and vague gesture that yet seems to have been made in the naive expectation of a conventional response - that is, of an audience's actually caring.","25","1714915"
"1102","A rock 'n' roll film should be funny-crazy -- not just a big, dumb promo for some over-the-hill dudes in makeup who are trying to sell today's kids on yesterday's glory by championing deliquency.","25","165710"
"1103","But seriously, folks, if you're going to make a scary movie, shouldn't you be able to do it without resorting to both ""Blair Witch""-style found footage and movie stars? (Will Patton and Elias Koteas also show up as, respectively, an angry sheriff and a psychologist friend of Abbey's.)","25","1220198"
"1104","If you loved the earlier films, these are moments you will hold on to, but they're very few, and they're not enough.","25","903624"
"1105","Defiantly graceless, Brett Ratner deals in loudness, haplessness, obviousness, and, certainly, crudeness, reminding you of his directorial presence with such inclusions as a scolded kid who tells his disciplinarian to ""suck it.""","25","471042"
"1106","Almost three hours long, a lugubrious sludge of mud soup called Cloud Atlas deserves a limp nod for pure guts, I suppose, but what I'd really like to do is burn it.","25","1371111"
"1107","Honey Boy is a dolorous example of an alarming trend in modern movies — the miraculous ability of an infinitesimal talent to raise money for an obnoxious, self-indulgent film about his own life designed to appeal to absolutely nobody except the arrogant subject himself. In this instance, the jerky centerpiece in love with himself to the detriment of everyone in the audience is Shia LaBeouf.","25","8151874"
"1108","All the tongue-in-cheek humor, film-buff jokes, and special effects in the world can't save this mess.","25","91276"
"1109","At 2.5 hours, 1492 is even harder to sit through than last month’s schlock extravaganza Christopher Columbus: The Discovery. In each case the filmmakers have fallen into a similar trap. Out of some vague mixture of historical ”duty” and commercial myopia, they’ve presented Columbus as the same cardboard visionary we learned about in school.","25","103594"
"1110","It's simply terrible.","25","146336"
"1111","Predator 2, an alien-monster movie that is racist and violent, not to mention atrociously acted and ham-handedly directed, has everything going for it a bad movie needs to be dismissed with a quip. But this is too ugly to be funny about. [23 Nov 1990]","25","100403"
"1112","The similar Kevin Bacon HBO movie ""Taking Chance"" got there first. Worse news: The earlier movie was sober, meticulous and quietly convincing, not a shouty, shoddy bore like this piece of flummery.","25","790712"
"1113","Chris Columbus, true to his namesake, has chartered new waters of lazy hackdom with this ""Clash of the Titans"" remade as a CW tween soap.","25","814255"
"1114","The Hateful Eight is basically an expensive vanity project allowing Tarantino to expound on his bizarre theories about race relations.","25","3460252"
"1115","It's a ho-hum-er, almost a complete bummer. [6 Jan 1989, Daily Datebook, p.E1]","25","94606"
"1116","I found the movie a long, unfunny slog through an impenetrable plot. Kids might like it.","25","109040"
"1117","Jennifer's Body mixes, matches, and crosses three popular genres: horror, comedy, and teen angst. Unfortunately, it fails at all of them - and ""fails"" might be too kind a term.","25","1131734"
"1118","Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ is the most virulently anti-Semitic movie made since the German propaganda films of World War II. It is sickening.","25","335345"
"1119","A supernatural thriller that is neither super, natural, nor thrilling.","25","142688"
"1120","Creepy.","25","133751"
"1121","Rock appears to have edited I Think I Love My Wife with a roulette wheel.","25","770772"
"1122","The enjoyment one wants from GIs fighting these creatures is stunted by the film’s lack of energy and imagination.","25","4530422"
"1123","Red Sparrow is too disturbing and brutal to be popcorn entertainment, and by trying to make the uncomfortable storylines and interminable torture sequences palatable for the audience, it completely undermines its ability to operate as a serious drama.","25","2873282"
"1124","They go on a biker trip from Cincinnati to the West Coast because they are tired of being bored and would prefer to bore us instead.","25","486946"
"1125","The same studio has aimed a remake at the same family market. Translation: The once-modest piece has been redesigned as a vehicle (a lumbering SUV) for Steve Martin, stripped of any vestigial charm, and then thrown into neutral, where its manic engine does nothing but roar loudly and pointlessly for the duration.","25","349205"
"1126","Just a lumbering, poorly photographed piece of derivative sci-fi drivel, full of grunting extras scampering around in animal pelts and more dank, trash-strewn sets than I ever care to see again.","25","185183"
"1127","As in the Friday the 13th movies the only real interest here is observing the outrageous lengths filmmakers go to indevising ""Can-you-top-this?"" murders.","25","77394"
"1128","There’s no humanity in this grave disappointment that justifies the passion his fans feel for the father of the iMac. Steve Jobs and all of the characters around him fail to come to life in any absorbing fashion. They’re not real people; they’re all hashtags.","25","2080374"
"1129","A big, incoherent bore, interesting only as an example of assembly-line movie-making gone awry.","25","288477"
"1130","It plays like a crude ""Godfather"" parody, the sort that might amuse as a 10-minute sketch on ""Saturday Night Live,"" but curdles and collapses as a 143-minute film. [09 Dec 1983]","25","86250"
"1131","An unrecognizable Michael Keaton seems to have aged 40 years since the last time he appeared on the screen, but he’s still the best (i.e., only) reason to suffer through a miserable load of deranged, deluded crap masquerading as a black comedy called Birdman.","25","2562232"
"1132","Amiably bland actors can be fun to watch, as Tom Hanks has proved. Freeman is no Hanks, though, and The Hitchhiker's Guide won't boost anyone's career into hyperspace. Or give your mind a workout.","25","371724"
"1133","If you stay and watch the endless end credits, there's a short scene that hints a sequel is coming. That's what I call real pain.","25","467197"
"1134","Brandishing a literal-minded title as laughable as the rest of its action, Cowboys & Aliens mashes up genres with a staunch dedication to getting everything wrong, making sure that each scene is more inane than the one that preceded it.","25","409847"
"1135","The movie's excruciating length is without dramatic or thematic justification.","25","421715"
"1136","Airplane II opens promisingly with a spate of hit-and-run gags, but the picture sags in the middle and lies flat for the last half-hour. Bringing on the rigor mortis is the appearance of William Shatner, playing the lunar-base commander who must guide Hays' troubled space shuttle to a safe landing. [14 Dec 1982, p.D14]","25","83530"
"1137","Promising outer-space majesty and deep-thought topics like some modern variation on Stanley Kubrick's “2001: A Space Odyssey,” Interstellar instead plays like a confused mix of daringly unique space-travel footage like you’ve never seen and droningly familiar emotional and plot beats that you’ve seen all too many times before.","25","816692"
"1138","A high-tech concept done in by low-tech script and low-wattage performances. [26 May 1995, p.24]","25","113481"
"1139","The unfortunate aspect of Class, which is glossier than Private Lessons and marginally more believable than My Tutor, is that its laughs are built around the suffering of a prime candidate for intensive therapy. Thus while the kids are watching one movie -- boy loses virginity, ya-hoo -- adults in the audience will be watching another -- wife and mother has an emotional breakdown at the hands, literally, of a 14-year-old. The latter, of course, is not funny. [25 July 1983, p.C6]","25","85346"
"1140","It's tructured in familiar, safe terms, plays for very low stakes, and appeals to no one so much as white, male teenagers with chips on their shoulders.","25","2802144"
"1141","For an 11-year-old sneaking into the theater for his first R-rated movie, Deadpool could prove to be a revelatory trip. For myself, it was an exhausting, grating experience, lacking in wit and cleverness as it crumbles underneath its wall-to-wall torrent of jokes. If this represents a new stage for comic-book adaptations, the future is even more dismal than one could have imagined.","25","1431045"
"1142","Far more concerned with pratfalling animal shenanigans and unearned uplift than crafting a single complex or amusing moment, it's a film caged in by formulaic plotting and plentiful pap.","25","1389137"
"1143","The camera style is grotesquely overwrought, a relentless exercise in technique for technique's sake. It's all here, folks: fancy wipes, expressionistic angles, quick-cut close-ups, stylized backlighting, camera moving in endless illogic. It's as if a 15-minute history of film technique had been compiled by a psychotic. [19 Mar 1986, p.B9]","25","91203"
"1144","A documentary on the formation of stalagmites would have been more compelling.","25","881320"
"1145","No, the indie horror movie ATM is not about a psychotic automated teller that charges the steepest of convenience fees - your life! - but it isn't much smarter than that premise, either.","25","1603257"
"1146","Great to look at but not much fun to watch… An emotionally uncommitted picture that's smirky and mawkish, by turns, and at heart, empty. [14 Dec 1990, Daily Datebook, p.E1]","25","99487"
"1147","Lambert relies so much on gore and mean-spiritedness that the actors can't help looking glum; they're clearly being ignored by a director who seems to have lost touch with all the human elements in the story. The movie is ultimately as lifeless as most of its characters end up being. [28 Aug 1992, p.28]","25","105128"
"1148","An unbearable exercise in provocation.","25","1191111"
"1149","Slow-moving, yawn-inducing remake.","25","185371"
"1150","The second film, in which one teen- ager is possessed by the spirit of a murderer - this is a supernatural Jekyll and Hyde - sets horror film fans to laughing and eventually to booing.[20 Nov 1985]","25","89686"
"1151","In a word, bull - cruddy, foul-smelling and fly-specked, an excuse for a series of cheap sex scenes and single-entendre gags. [15 June 1988]","25","94812"
"1152","Favors giggly juvenile humor over inspired satire and ends up not with a moral, but a moral vacuum.","25","265208"
"1153","One could criticize A Night at the Roxbury for being a comedy that provides not a single laugh. That would be too easy.","25","120770"
"1154","Neither thrilling nor psychological, but it's chicly shot and edited and is pretty much art-directed to death.","25","371257"
"1155","Paradise is neither a good film nor is there any evidence it was a good script.","25","1262990"
"1156","In a case study of how to screw up a simple, powerful revenge story, director Jonathan Hensleigh punishes audiences with an unbearably sluggish action movie that requires the word ""action"" to be placed in quotes.","25","330793"

"1159","There's a startling moment 10 or 15 minutes into The Adjustment Bureau - the only time, really, when the film achieves any level of surprise. The dispiriting dullness of this dreary misfire hasn't had time to settle in and thicken: The movie hasn't yet revealed its utter and thorough ineptitude.","25","1385826"
"1160","The sole mystery is the apparent collapse of Carpenter's skills as a storyteller. Prince of Darkness is shapeless and almost utterly lacking in rhythm, as if it had been slashed and then badly reassembled, like a Carpenter victim. [28 Oct 1987, p.D8]","25","93777"
"1161","At a certain point, Bean goes beyond awful to surreally awful, like the rug Burt Reynolds sports in a cameo. The last-ditch plunge into pathos does nothing to redeem the feeling. Let's hope no sequel is in the offing. The only thing worse than Bean would be a hill of Beans. [07Nov1997 Pg08.D]","25","118689"
"1162","It'd probably feel just a little bit timelier and more relevant if it took place in a universe that bore even the faintest resemblance to our own.","25","1059786"
"1163","For all his invention, Forsyth's reach ultimately exceeds his grasp. ""Local Hero,"" without trying so self-consciously hard, conveyed more of the ephemeral beauty of life than Being Human does.","25","106379"
"1164","Stoner jokes, awful gags, and just stupid stuff equate to one bad movie.","25","185431"
"1165","Promoted as ""the year's scariest movie,"" it's anything but.","25","387564"
"1166","Essentially a weird series of nonsequiturs. I'd rather be watching a sequel to the much-maligned ""Little Nicky"" -- a Sandler film that was at least trying to do something interesting -- than this failed experiment in fusing high and low culture.","25","272338"
"1167","Een fans of Jay and Silent Bob may find the story too slender and the jokes too repetitive to be much fun.","25","261392"
"1168","Halfheartedly, I give The Dark Knight Rises - the third and final Batflick in the Nolan trilogy - one star for eardrum-busting sound effects and glaucoma-inducing computerized images in blinding Imax, but talk about stretching things.","25","1345836"
"1169","Say a little prayer and save your money.","25","286162"
"1170","The real problem with This Is 40 is its lack of truth, that Apatow wanted to express something about married life, and it eluded him. After all, no less than Kierkegaard once said that the actual dynamics of marriage are beyond the scope of art, and he was the best movie critic of the 19th century.","25","1758830"

"1275","Call The Master whatever you want, but lobotomized catatonia from what I call the New Hacks can never take the place of well-made narrative films about real people that tell profound stories for a broader and more sophisticated audience.

"1291","It's crass, cruel, and borderline offensive, but the laughs that could redeem all of that are missing. Material as bad as the tripe that comprises Norbit can be endured only if there's a payoff. In this case, the point seems to be that some actors will do anything for a buck.","25","477051"

"1299","Ultimately groans under the weight of its own quiet gorgeousness.","25","120834"
"1300","You don't want to think, what would Preston Sturges or Alexander Payne do with this material? But there is a seed of satirical cynicism in this movie that a smart, clear mind could have finessed. Jake Kasdan is not that director. He doesn't appear to know what to do.","25","1284575"
"1301","It's mesmerizing nonetheless for its flagrant disregard for narrative, character, pacing, performance and good lighting.","25","209958"
"1302","Gorehounds will likely be pleased by the graphic bloodletting, but there's little else of interest here.","25","96426"
"1303","Vulgarity is a very tricky thing to handle in a comedy; tone is everything, and the makers of ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" have an absolute gift for taking potentially funny situations and turning them into general embarrassment. They're tone-deaf.","25","83929"

"1306","Chock-full of holes.","25","822849"
"1307","As a thriller, Next goes a certain distance on Cage's sad-sack charm and sense of humor, but it does nothing with its intriguing premise, and it's mostly just one more tedious and progressively dumb collection of Hollywood action clichés.","25","435705"
"1308","It's a film that reeks of stupidity and cynicism, one that makes you feel soiled just to have sat through it.","25","244244"
"1309","Despite its deficiencies, Annabelle is not without a modicum of verve. It has its unnerving moments, but they’re outweighed by the sheer stupidity and predictability of the story.","25","3322940"

"1311","Several of the changes to Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata’s brilliant manga have already been widely reported, including the whitewashing of the entire project by relocating it from Japan to Seattle, but those are just the symptoms of a greater disease known as complete creative bankruptcy.","25","1241317"
"1312","As schematic as Third Person is on a whole, it’s downright risible on a moment-to-moment basis.","25","2343793"
"1313","This particular script is deplorable. It's a pure cribbing of Ron Bass' screenplay for ""Sleeping With the Enemy,"" which was no prize itself.","25","278435"
"1314","The film itself is wretched. A grueling, numbing black hole.","25","115734"
"1315","What keeps coming to mind throughout The Jackal is that for what it cost to make this movie you could probably pay some nice hit man to eliminate everyone at Universal who thought making the movie would be a good idea, and still have enough left over to throw one of those hit man parties and have a really great time.","25","119395"

"1325","The movie equivalent of the fruitcake you get every year from the folks back home. It's brick-heavy and full of nasty bits you don't want to put in your mouth, lovingly wrapped in pink cellophane.","25","146675"
"1326","Although the ""story"" is almost wholly without depth or plausibility, it's carried off with great style.","25","85549"
"1327","No one is getting at anything in The Strangers, except the cheapest, ugliest kind of sadistic titillation.","25","482606"
"1328","Cheesy.","25","220506"
"1329","Eisner has almost nothing on his mind, no political rumblings, nothing behind the urge to upgrade vintage trash.","25","455407"
"1330","While the King source material forcefully taps into some deep-seated fears, PET SEMATARY (which was to have been directed by George Romero) squanders its potential through the ham-handed direction of Mary Lambert (SIESTA), who continually goes for visceral shocks at the expense of the more deeply disturbing psychological themes inherent in the material.","25","98084"
"1331","I hated this clunker long before the third act “twists” that are supposed to make it better, make it make sense and give us hope that this is a future franchise.","25","6017942"
"1332","Ready To Wear is certainly a disappointment, if not an outright flop. [27 Dec 1994]","25","110907"
"1333","Besides the humor and the technical savvy, the biggest difference between this film and the five before it is that the characters are actually allowed to live long enough for the audience to develop some sort of empathy with them. Some of these teenagers are downright likable, and we don't want to see them get killed. That element, more than any other, was the real breakthrough in the series.","25","91080"
"1334","Imagine the worst ""Deadwood"" episode ever, and you'll get an idea of the general tone of Beowulf & Grendel, which is full of anachronistic cursing, tortured syntax, dark humor and lots of hairy, homely, filthy-looking people.","25","402057"
"1335","You don't expect much from an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie, of course: lots of combat - high-tech and/or hand-to-hand - a skeletal plot upon which to hang shots of the most admired pecs in Hollywood, and costumes that don't cover the pecs. But The Running Man, it must be reported, does not meet even these unexacting standards. [16 Nov 1987]","25","93894"
"1336","The charm, versatility and charisma of Jason Bateman and the camera-ready good looks of Ryan Reynolds should add up to more than a piece of crummy, amateurish junk called The Change-Up.","25","1488555"
"1337","The movie is occasionally clever, but still inferior to last year's ""Twilight"" film, mostly because the story is so muddled.","25","450405"
"1338","Growing-up films are bad enough without a shameless all-girl rip off of Stand By Me. [20 Oct 1995]","25","114011"
"1339","Let's look at the bright side. If this movie bombs as it deserves to, we won't have to sit through ""Analyze Those"" a few years from now!","25","289848"
"1340","Even in the summertime, the most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities. Movies like XXX -- a big 000 -- don't deserve our $$$.","25","295701"
"1341","Without the brute vigilante junk, this 82-minute picture would be approximately 2 minutes long.","25","453556"
"1342","The obvious question about Repo Men: Why bother?","25","1053424"
"1343","Implicit in the artlessness of this scene is the filmmakers' sense of the formulaic nature of their work, which requires no higher art than bartering with the butcher for spare parts; when the teen van moves out, like a fisheries truck loaded with trout for the spring re-stocking, it's a nod to the genre and a wink for the grown-ups in the crowd. The rest is in your face. [16 Aug 1982, p.B4]","25","83972"
"1344","Add to the long-winded title of this film, “…and completely unnecessary.”","25","2481498"
"1345","The laughs don’t even land with a thud. In The Boss, they almost never land at all.","25","2702724"
"1346","As always in Emmerich's rollicking Armageddons, the cannon speaks with an expensive bang, while the fodder gets afforded nary a whimper. Of course, that's just part of disaster's simple recipe: Blow us up, then blow us off.","25","1190080"
"1347","The movie is a dismal and misguided special-effects romp featuring two of the deadest performances recorded this year so far.","25","118661"
"1348","Forget all of it being true; I would have settled for some of it being interesting.","25","9206798"
"1349","After a slightly promising start, this great-looking but ultimately deeply confusing and unscary sci-fi/horror opus turns into a quite boring rehash of M. Night Shyamalan's post-""Signs"" films.","25","362478"
"1350","Starts out as a neo-Pygmalion comedy, but the film is slow, earnest, and rhythmless.","25","100405"
"1351","Resembles a period version of ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" - played dead straight.","25","180073"
"1352","First-time director Rachel Talalay and writer Michael DeLuca provide nothing but clumsily played stock characters who fail to earn the sympathy necessary for a stand-up-and-cheer conclusion. [15 Sept 1991, p.C6]","25","101917"
"1353","Bram Stoker's Dracula is a lovingly made, gorgeously realized, meticulously crafted failure. It has big names, a big budget, big sets, a big, thundering score and even big hair. But it doesn't do it. It doesn't excite or fascinate but just lies there on the screen. [13 Nov 1992, p. C1]","25","103874"
"1354","Sports movies have a long, troubled history of well-meaning white paternalism, with poor black athletes finding success through white charity. But The Blind Side, based on Michael Lewis’ non-fiction book, finds a new low.","25","878804"
"1355","It's the sign of an empty, depressing experience when the only tension is over Bob's choice to use a power drill or a weed whacker for his next kill.","25","455944"
"1356","More manipulative, maudlin trash from the Disney-Pixar content farm.","25","1979388"
"1357","One regards Reign of Fire with awe. What a vast enterprise has been marshaled in the service of such a minute idea. Incredulity is our companion, and it is twofold: We cannot believe what happens in the movie, and we cannot believe that the movie was made.","25","253556"
"1358","You do get conscientious Hanks' miscast floundering (it's not pretty); Bruce Willis' lazy performance (it's beyond miscasting) as a hack journalist; showoff camera pyrotechnics; the thudding of dialogue that was hysterically funny in the book; an appallingly wrongheaded ending (even to non-readers); and the most numbingly needless and stupid off-screen narration yet. [21 Dec 1990, p.1D]","25","99165"
"1359","Unknown makes no sense at all, so you not only worry about Liam Neeson's judgment in movies, but you begin to wonder if he's forgotten how to read.","25","1401152"
"1360","For all of its homicidal aliens and toothy beasts, I Am Number Four did contain one element that genuinely unsettled me: the line ""produced by Michael Bay."" Nooooooo!","25","1464540"
"1361","The superhero film equivalent of the worst kid at the playground.","25","1634106"
"1362","As a movie, it's so tightly framed you gasp from claustrophobia. As a film of cryptic boredom, I cannot believe the actors were able to say their lines without cue cards.","25","1615147"
"1363","This movie demands that the viewer -- and even its own characters -- turn into thumb-sucking 3-year-olds with no need for plausibility or logic, as long as there are lots of flashing lights and whooshing noises emanating from the screen.","25","408790"
"1364","Gordon, who died shortly after the first Arthur, never had to see the luckless 1988 sequel that made his beloved characters seem like strangers. The new Arthur, insipid when it should be infectious, leaves the same deadly impression.","25","1334512"
"1365","Martyrs is only eighty minutes long, sans credits, yet still it manages to cram four bad horror films into its meager runtime.","25","1663655"
"1366","Sin City: A Dame to Kill For is still a visual buffet, but adding 102 more minutes of double crosses, slow torture and hookers with hearts of gold just exposes the tediousness of the exercise.","25","458481"
"1367","There’s something very cheap at the core of this overtly, ostentatiously expensive film, reliant as it is on our memory of the original to accentuate every significant moment.","25","6105098"
"1368","Tom Lazarus and Rick Ramage should be ashamed to have written such nonsense.","25","145531"
"1369","The “social commentary” feels exactly as derivative as the rest of the film, like someone artlessly smushing together imagery they’ve seen, a sort of uncanny Muzak of hip provocation written by a less coherent Bret Easton Ellis.","25","6205872"
"1370","The morality of revenge is barely at issue in a movie that pushes the plausibility of revenge right over a cliff.","25","804461"
"1371","Steve Miner is no Carpenter. A directing veteran of the Friday the 13th saga (parts II and III, in case you care), he's a plodder who favours long, dull buildups to short, dull climaxes -- it's slaughter by the numbers.","25","120694"
"1372","At nearly two hours, Mirrors is overlong for a summer horror toss-off, and the movie's three or four false endings make it seem even more of a haul.","25","790686"
"1373","So strong, so shocking and yet so audacious that people walk out shaking their heads; they don't know quite what to make of it.","25","90756"
"1374","Based on a videogame, Hitman could be the year's dumbest movie.","25","465494"
"1375","A dreary experience.","25","1045778"
"1376","For most of its running time, Wes Craven's New Nightmare is simply a s-l-o-w- tease to a paradoxical, reality-bending shockfest that never materializes. [14 Oct 1994, p.G9]","25","111686"
"1377","""Enemy"" and ""Sicario"" were unspeakable disasters, and Arrival, the director’s latest exercise in pretentious poopery, gives me every reason to believe I have parted company with Denis Villeneuve for good.","25","2543164"
"1378","How did an embarrassment of comic-book riches become simply an embarrassment as a movie?","25","287978"
"1379","Dismal final installment.","25","242653"
"1380","Sorry, but if your sensibility is pure trashy camp, don't expect anyone not to laugh when you try to be earnest.","25","1107319"
"1381","The Pinkberry solipsism of this particular franchise all but requires our heroine persist as a lovelorn martyr for her audience’s benefit.","25","1473832"
"1382","The real evil in this flick isn't Blackheart (Wes Bentley), the devil's son, it's the soul-sucking devil of modern cinema: Hollywood formula.","25","259324"
"1383","At a time when every penny counts, where do they come up with the money to finance a movie this boring?","25","878835"
"1384","Condescending, self-righteous and sloppy, Truth is simply a bad film for which there are no excuses.","25","3859076"
"1385","It's encouraging to see Hollywood tackle themes of faith and religion, but here, too, Shyamalan is timid, reducing them to fuzzy New Age clichés. Add wooden acting, stilted dialogue, and a faux-arty style, and you have a thudding disappointment.","25","286106"
"1386","The only true horror about Clive Barker's Hellraiser III is that this movie was ever made. It is the worst of the series, offering nothing but cheap scare scenes, a weird message about healing the wounds of the Vietnam War and sex scenes too explicit for kids. The acting is soap-opera shallow. [22 Sep 1992, p.33]","25","104409"
"1387","The Boxtrolls is a visually repellent pile of stop-motion animation, populated by grotesques and filmed in the palette of an exhumed casket's interior. It can frighten small children and bore anyone, with its cracked, cackled British wit.","25","787474"
"1388","The film ends up landing in a confused middle category. It's neither a coherent, discrete work nor a zany tribute to the late actor.","25","1054606"
"1389","Bad teen film unredeemed by aspirations toward significance.","25","100436"
"1390","The director over-simplifies the killer, portraying a perpetrator of some of the most heinous acts imaginable as a basic fool with mommy issues. It’s crass and careless stuff in a crass and careless movie. Avoid at all costs.","25","7280898"
"1391","So witless it wins most of its laughs when Czech-speaking characters spout obscenities that get translated into English subtitles.","25","187738"
"1392","Save yourself 10 bucks, and an hour and 45 minutes of your precious time.","25","892318"
"1393","A soul-killing sequel that gets its kicks torturing and murdering children and offers little hope or redemption. King has long wanted to commit “Redrum” on the reputation of Kubrick’s film, which he openly despises. Nearly 40 years later, this adaptation of King’s 2013 book “Doctor Sleep” doesn’t so much tarnish Kubrick as embarrass itself.","25","5606664"
"1394","Cmera work can't do anything about the barrenness of the screenplay, nor the sense of fundamental insincerity at the core of the film. [03 Sep 1993]","25","107302"
"1395","There’s idiotic, and there’s magnificent, but The Greatest Showman is that special thing that happens sometimes. It’s magnificently idiotic. It’s an awful mess, but it’s flashy. The temptation is to cover your face and watch it through your fingers, because it’s so earnest and embarrassing and misguided — and yet it’s well-made.","25","1485796"
"1396","It's a bomb - not the usual bomb, but a time bomb, despite a 20-minute stretch at the beginning that goes along nicely. [17 May 1991]","25","103241"
"1397","Why Him? is the kind of movie that makes trendy sophistication and homespun values look equally unattractive; the only remaining alternative is anarchy, an ingredient that’s sadly lacking in this bland, formulaic comedy.","25","4501244"
"1398","Belongs in a less ambitious category of sequels, alongside the creatively lacking “Alvin and the Chipmunks” and “Ice Age” movies.","25","2510894"
"1399","Burlesque is the celluloid equivalent to a Big Mac attack, and any resemblance to a plot is purely coincidental.","25","1126591"
"1400","If you're going to direct a piece of crass, nonsensical junk, at least have the decency to release it straight to video, where it belongs.","25","229260"
"1401","Equilibrium doesn't tread softly on our dreams; it tramples them.","25","238380"
"1402","Disney is creatively bankrupt and bereft of ingenuity -- especially in its live-action films. [25 Dec 1998, p.8F]","25","120751"
"1403","A complete misfire.","25","113749"
"1404","This is a deeply unpleasant movie masquerading as a heartfelt social commentary on life in these United States.","25","371246"
"1405","Ferrara displays a surprising lack of imagination throughout, sticking to the original film's predictable Who'll be next? progression. [21 Feb 1994, p.C6]","25","106452"
"1406","It has a little something to irritate everybody. People looking for romance will find only cardboard lovers. People looking for a resounding musical will find it odd that the camera runs away from the lip-synching cast. And people looking for opera -- well, shame on you.","25","293508"
"1407","The whole thing is monumentally gruesome and just as monumentally cynical, a riot of grisly cliches designed to titillate and amuse.","25","985694"
"1408","Not only does American Outlaws distort history, but the filmmakers have created a dull, one-dimensional pop icon out of James' complex character and legend.","25","244000"
"1409","It's always raining or snowing or misting. This makes for a nice visual, but it also makes the scenes look interchangeable. This is even more of a problem because the writer-director, Michael J. Bassett, imparts no shape to the story. Many movies suffer from worse problems, but not many waste the talents of Max von Sydow, as Solomon's father, or Pete Postlethwaite.","25","970452"
"1410","Kind of a bore.","25","426459"
"1411","The movie knocks itself unconscious trying to be offbeat, but instead of cinematic heart, the director self-indulges in cinematic art, drowning the whole thing in freeze frames, slow-motion and color-coding, owing everything he knows to the worst of Jean-Luc Godard and Wes Anderson.","25","1440292"
"1412","Ritter lacks the charisma to bring his role off, the slapstick is tiresome, and Edwards' script fails to generate sympathy for Zach or to develop characters.","25","98343"
"1413","Brad’s Status rarely affords its titular character an opportunity to have a real conversation with anyone else his own age, so the movie becomes a monologue from someone you quickly realize you don’t really want to get to know anyway.","25","5884230"
"1414","The movie isn't hellish, because there's always hope of leaving it. It's more like purgatory, two whole hours of it.","25","360486"
"1415","Doing his best to class up the joint, ""The Wire's"" Idris Elba stars as the perfect man.","25","1198138"
"1416","The Conspirator hits a new nadir for Redford: Sitting through this stage-bound, talky, stiffly-acted movie reminded me of having to endure the Hall of Presidents attraction at Walt Disney World (one of the few existing bits of proof that Disney had a dark and evil side).","25","968264"
"1417","But don’t be fooled! This is not Oscar bait at all. Roman J. Israel, Esq. is the kind of horrendous hot mess an actor makes directly after he wins the Oscar.","25","6000478"
"1418","Nothing can save this repetitive bore. Dude, where's your memory?","25","289879"
"1419","More than merely another bad movie, it's the most depressing development yet in Coppola's career. It's a would-be cash cow bred cynically to excrete money, the arty answer to ""Child's Play 2"" or ""Back to the Future III.""","25","99674"
"1420","Caruso, who showed flair in the Val Kilmer vehicle ""The Salton Sea,"" has a penchant for the dark side. In this case, it's the plodding, predictable ZIP code of the dark side.","25","364045"
"1421","The Lorax is awful, like chronic disease.","25","1482459"
"1422","It wimped out by blanding down the story and the characters to the point where she isn't really a shrew and he isn't really a maniac.","25","147800"
"1423","A shell of a romantic fantasy festooned with characters inspired by and resembling those in the bar scene in ""Star Wars,"" the waiting room in ""Beetlejuice"" and the circus in ""A Bug's Life.""","25","166276"
"1424","In an attempt to be complex and fair-minded, a simple story becomes a jumble of confused motivations.","25","133952"
"1425","A horrible mess of a movie, without shape, trajectory or purpose--a one joke movie, if it had one joke.","25","120669"
"1426","It's shaping up to be a long, dry summer, at least at the multiplex.","25","429493"
"1427","Sarah Michelle Gellar, the nominal star, has been in her share of horror movies, and all by herself could have written and directed a better one than this.","25","391198"
"1428","If all terrorists were like these idiots, the US would have nothing to worry about.","25","1341167"
"1429","It is a grand-looking, grandly empty pageant.","25","397535"
"1430","Jurassic World gives you exactly what Howard’s character promises at the beginning — More! Bigger! Faster! — but you know there’s something deeply wrong with a film that expects you to shed tears over digitally created prehistoric creatures and rubber brontosaurus heads instead of rooting for, you know, people.","25","369610"
"1431","There is also a last-minute ""Sixth Sense"" twist, although it definitely won't make you sit through the movie again to see if the filmmakers cheated.","25","1037705"
"1432","The script is breezy, but neither of the two leads have the heft or charm to carry an entire feature-length film - separately or together.","25","1839492"
"1433","A pointless drama that trafficks in cliché.","25","896872"
"1434","Shanley tries to make something courageous and symbolic out of the notion of jumping into a volcano, but his philosophizing is sentimental, heavy-handed and forced. The idea of doing something reckless and adventurous even becomes a bit depressing when it dawns on you that Shanley may have been taking his own advice with this movie, for less than glorious results. [9 Mar 1990, p.E3]","25","99892"
"1435","Not surprisingly, the remake gussies up the grindhouse roughness of the first film, which makes it relatively more palatable-yet still vapid and repulsive-while also, in a perverse way, selling it out.","25","1242432"
"1436","Clocking in at two hours and 20 minutes, it seems intended to have been a crime epic in the vein of Michael Mann’s “Heat,” about two men of talent and spirit who happen to be on opposite sides of the law. And it’s sort of like that, if you can imagine a Michael Mann picture that has been set on fire and dropped from an airplane.","25","1259528"
"1437","There’s no better time than summer for a fun, brainless thriller. All you need is three key ingredients: a charismatic hero, a hateable villain and a snappy screenplay...Skyscraper, regrettably, cuts likable star Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson off at the knees by failing to deliver on the other two.","25","5758778"
"1438","Why, besides a stellar opening weekend, does this extended narrative exist?","25","2226417"
"1439","Director Joel Schumacher has fashioned a film foul enough to qualify as an inadvertent satire - it's obvious Schumacher (D.C. Cab) wants the audience to care about the septet, but the writing is so rocky, the situations so contrived, the acting so awkward and the characters so self-centred, witless and amoral, it's almost as if St. Elmo's Fire had been conceived as a vicious anti-youth movie, a calculated attempt to destroy en masse the reputations of some of Hollywood's hottest young actors. [28 June 1985]","25","90060"
"1440","Schnabel can't decide whether he wants to tell a traditional rise-and-fall morality tale or make an art film. His attempt at telling Basquiat's story straightforwardly collapses under its own banality.","25","115632"
"1441","Valentine's Day is a date movie from hell.","25","817230"
"1442","Features an exceedingly dapper Richard Gere in a series of nice suits and handsome close-ups that serve no purpose other than to remind us how exceedingly dapper Richard Gere looks in nice suits and handsome close-ups.The rest of the movie registers as a loss of: time, money, talent and logic.","25","1764183"
"1443","Though the film does contain a few minutes of patented Carpenter camera magic, it is unable to sustain either story or character. For all its flash and color, it is a dull film--an artless dig in the Spielberg garden. [02 July 1986, p.C3]","25","90728"
"1444","Fans of the novel might get some minor thrills from the big screen adaptation, but it's hard to understand what made the material so popular in the first place.","25","1790864"
"1445","Short on story, character, and attempts to win viewers' emotional investment, the film only seems to take a breath when The Rock is making the baddies lose theirs.","25","351977"

"1450","If only one character in Stone reacted as someone in his position would to the preposterous situation at hand, the movie would be 15 minutes long.","25","1423995"
"1451","Scratch the surface, and the movie's underpinnings are an insult to women everywhere -- the film is slick stupid propaganda for the myth of The One True Love that wastes the talents of fine actresses.","25","1001508"
"1452","This tale of teenage witches run amok is silly, juvenile stuff, and it doesn't even have the decency to stick to its own ridiculous logic. [03 May 1996, p.6G]","25","115963"
"1453","Actor-turned-director Don Cheadle trashes the historic career of Miles Davis in Miles Ahead, named after one of the greatest albums ever made by one of the most influential musicians of all time.","25","790770"
"1454","Two for the Money, which was written by Dan Gilroy (Freejack, Chasers), is so badly constructed and illogical that its inanities manage to drown the actor (Pacino) out.","25","417217"
"1455","Tusk is a step backward into an insular world. True, it will probably play well to gore fans, and that dedicated audience who already cheer everything Smith does.","25","3099498"
"1456","The flat tire of summer movies.","25","187078"
"1457","Scooby-Doo is bad. Let's just get that right out of the way. Filled with unclever quips, tired humor, a lazy silliness and bland execution, the picture is a tedious puff of nothing.","25","267913"
"1458","Norton's high-energy acting is the only element that saves the picture from being a total loss.","25","120586"
"1459","The jokes? ""Chicks are for fags,"" says Lloyd. The film is subtitled When Harry Met Lloyd. Believe me, you don't want to be there.","25","329028"
"1460","This is a no-cable, no-wake-up-call, cash-only dump of a film, where you breathe through a hankie and bring your own Lysol.","25","452702"
"1461","Why are Steve Carell and Tina Fey wasting their time, and ours, by appearing in the miserable comedy Date Night?","25","1279935"

"1463","There's scant character development, pedestrian dialogue, and an almost complete lack of humor.","25","240900"

"1465","So, in essence, The Informers fails precisely because we never believe these lost souls were ever human enough to have had a soul to lose in the first place.","25","865554"
"1466","The emotional core of the movie, the relationship between Nicky and Jess, lacks impact, mostly because you can’t believe a word that they say, but also because Smith is not a strong leading man.","25","2381941"
"1467","It’s a film that tosses questions at the viewer with no interest in answering them, one that can’t decide if it feels for its subjects or just wants to mock their incompetence.","25","6212478"
"1468","Gosh, what to say about House of 1000 Corpses? That it's about 999 too many, for starters. Then again, in a picture where the body count is the whole point and the only purpose, carping about the math rather misses the mark.","25","251736"
"1469","Ponderously telling some parts of its sketch-of-a-story from multiple points of view, it’s an excruciating exercise in self-indulgence, packed with flashbacks and those big speeches/big scenes that draw names like Oscar winner Jeff Bridges, Dakota Johnson and Jon Hamm to its cast. It adds up to nothing more than two hours and 21 minutes of tedium, with the odd spasm of violence, back-story or musical interlude.","25","6628394"
"1470","Perfectly passable kiddie escapism. It has a thrill or two, and a chill or three, but it has no poetry, little sense of wonder, no resonant subtext (Jungian or otherwise), no art... When it's over, it's gone. Extinct.","25","107290"
"1471","It's phony and forced, but mostly it's just silly. If there was once a satirical edge to this thriller, it's been programmed right out.","25","218817"

"1480","The film's centerpiece is a massacre at a wet T-shirt contest, which the horror director Alexandre Aja has a good time staging (yes, Eli Roth, we see you with the water gun). But it feels like an imitation of B-movie beach schlock and John Waters. The visual humor lacks wit or nerve.","25","464154"

"1491","Aquaman continues to revel in the outdated 1970s superhero ideal that mankind is unquestionably worth saving. Add to that some awkward dialogue, a poorly conceived visual effects palette, and a soul-crushing and bladder-crushing 139-minute run time, and you have another disappointing entry in the DC Comics cinematic universe.","25","1477834"
"1492","The film is a criminal waste of an ensemble cast that should have found something better to do than lend their names to such a pointless exercise. Free Fire is a misfire.","25","4158096"

"1494","If nothing else, this accidentally hilarious, goofy train wreck of an origin story most definitely has the courage of its convictions. Alas, the film isn’t smart enough to recognize that its convictions are dumb, and it doesn’t have the goods to back them up in the first place.","25","4532826"
"1495","Perhaps they truly believe war is an inescapable aspect of human life. If so, why make movies that rub our faces in its horror? If artists have no antidote to war's evil or insight into the suffering it brings, their motive in depicting it must be merely to sensationalize its terrors and make money from the morbid fascination it holds for audiences. We deserve better.","25","265086"
"1496","I love the publicity quotes by Baz Luhrmann stating that his intention was to make an epic romantic vision that is enormous. Also: overwrought, asinine, exaggerated and boring. But in the end, about as romantic as a pet rock.","25","1343092"

"1503","It’s a calculatedly heartwarming and good-humored look at atrocious actions, ideas, and attitudes with a pallid glow of halcyon optimism, a view of a change of heart that’s achieved through colossal exertions and confrontations with danger.","30","6966692"
"1504","Why is she (Bullock) demeaning herself with such shoddy goods? She’s a talented woman with a faithful following. She has made formula films of varying quality before, and her fans may well swallow this one, but it’s a formula for disappointment laced with dismay.","30","1041829"
"1505","Field comes off best under the circumstances - she has real spirit - but Leibman, too eager to be liked, hits all the stereotypes on the head and Bridges is saddled with an underwritten, utterly inexplicable character. What Norma Rae really tells us is that Hollywood is still capable of making condescending paeans to the ""little people"" with all the phoniness of yesteryear. [5 March 1979, p.105]","30","79638"

"1507","Another unworthy follow-up to the modestly scary and well-crafted, Clive Barker-directed Hellraiser from 1987. Therefore with Hellrasier 6, lots of confusion and silly slasher joke writing is raised, but not much hell, in any sixth sense of the word.","30","274546"

"1514","Directed by Gregory Hoblit from a screenplay by a trio (a trio!) of whomevers, Untraceable hasn't the brains of a class-act psychothriller like ""The Silence of the Lambs"" (though it does reprise that film's titillating homophobia); worse yet, it lacks the balls to juice up the trashy verve of the ""Saw"" series.","30","880578"
"1515","George Roy Hill's 1969 film moves with steady, stupid grace from oozy sentimentality to nihilistic violence.","30","64115"

"1517","Emmerich can crack the whip on computer pixels like nobody’s business. But in sacrificing a reckoning on the human toll of war for cardboard characterization and showoff fx, he’s left an empty space where the soul of the film should be.","30","6924650"

"1519","Kids who can stomach mixed holiday fare should be able to ride out this stereoscopic superstorm of snowglobes, Easter eggs, magic portals, enchanted crystals, moon worship, fruitcakes, matryoshka dolls, and lost teeth. Others may be confused.","30","1446192"
"1520","Unfortunately, fulfilling an apparent need to assert absolute control over his early successes no matter the cost, the director has gone ahead and loused up his 1979 masterpiece of gothic sci-fi horror.","30","78748"
"1521","The drama is repetitive rather than resonant, an over-calculated, under-ventilated studio production -- even paranoid thrillers need to breathe -- whose plot machinery grinds grim and coarse.","30","476964"

"1526","Ribald yet frantically unfunny, it wears out its welcome within the first five minutes, and never comes close to gaining it back. It feels like an alternately flat and flailing television pilot for a bro-comedy no one in their right mind would ever pick up.","30","2170439"
"1527","Because the movie never fully engages us, it never quite manages to allay our queasiness about watching the boy's distress.","30","167404"
"1528","This low budget effort from director John Erick Dowdle and writer-producer-brother Drew Dowdle provides a few late scares after plenty of eye-rolling setup, with said scares due more to the heavy sound design than the action itself.","30","2870612"
"1529","The movie is childishly naïve... like a New Age social-studies lesson. It isn't really revisionist; it's the old stuff toned down and sensitized. [17 Dec 1990]","30","99348"

"1538","Slater not only makes for a dull Supergirl, but she's stuck in a clumsy, silly film that tries for the light touch of Richard Lester's Superman II and fails decisively.","30","88206"
"1539","Not just any kind of trash, it's high-art trash, a kind of ""When Tutu Goes Psycho"" that so prizes hysteria over sanity that it's worth your life to tell when its characters are hallucinating and when they're not.","30","947798"
"1540","Making concessions at every turn to the youth-horror market, the film slashes the ages of its protagonists by some 15 years, and its IQ follows suit.","30","432291"
"1541","The denizens of Judd Apatow’s Funny People have been pulled every which way to fit a misshapen concept, yet they remain painfully unfunny, and consistently off-putting.","30","1201167"
"1542","Utterly lacking the drive and roller-coaster energy expected of top action pics, this latest try at repackaging ""Speed"" is a Kmart version of a Jerry Bruckheimer production.","30","163579"
"1543","Robert De Niro is back doing standup in The Comedian, and it's a movie made to be heckled. Full of gross jokes (and an even grosser love story), it deserves the hook — and fast.","30","1967614"
"1544","The Da Vinci Code wasn’t Da Vinci, but it was an actual movie with texture and characters. Inferno is dumbed down to a shocking degree.","30","3062096"
"1545","Although it's refreshing to see an action movie that doesn't pretend to be something it isn't, this frankness has a downside, because what the picture so unapologetically is isn't, in fact, much.","30","118615"
"1546","Much has changed in the two decades since the release of Joel Schumacher's Falling Down, but, as The Angriest Man in Brooklyn flatly reminds us, the grievances of America's petulant middle-class men apparently have not.","30","1294970"
"1547","Just compare their superficiality to the complex characters in ""From Here to Eternity"" and what's missing here becomes terribly clear.","30","213149"
"1548","The most disheartening line in 187 is its last, written in bold type across the screen just before the credits roll: ""A teacher wrote this movie."" It's enough to make you weep, and not just because it's painful to think that this muddled and manipulative film was penned by someone in a position to mold impressionable minds. [30 Jul 1997, p.F1]","30","118531"
"1549","Something does have to give, and that's the nine-figure public patronage of this kind of anemic, wit-free entertainment. Meyers's shakin' moneymaker isn't the worst film of 2003 -- no cat suits, for one thing -- but something scarier: a standard-issue bog of glossy idiocy and audience disrespect.","30","337741"
"1550","Watching Allen fart out a story when he has no characters is always painful, as people are defined through clumsy expository dialogue and ranked according to their cultural accomplishments. But the script here is lazy even by his standards.","30","497465"
"1551","The Hitcher is a highly unimaginative slasher that keeps the tension going with a massacre about every 15 minutes.","30","91209"
"1552","The main audience for this dim little sex comedy has no particular interest in seeing Ms. Alba act. They want to see her in her underwear and also to confront one of the central cultural questions of our time: will she take her top off?","30","452625"
"1553","Unfortunately, this is one of those movies with a twist ending that turns a character inside out, revealing earlier scenes to be essentially fraudulent and more or less invalidating one's emotional investment in the story. No one ever walked out of a Hitchcock movie feeling as cheated as this made me feel.","30","1243957"
"1554","Originality has never been a high value in the genre-bound aesthetic of filmmaking, but De Palma cheapens what he steals, draining the Hitchcock moves of their content and complexity. He's left with a collection of empty technical tricks—obtrusive and gimmick-crazed, this film has been “directed” within an inch of its life—and he fills in the blanks with an offhand cruelty toward his characters, a supreme contempt for his audience (at one point, we're compared to the drooling voyeurs who inhabit his vision of Bellevue), and a curdled, adolescent vision of sexuality.","30","80661"
"1555","Braveheart is too much, too late.","30","112573"
"1556","Offers neither horror nor style.","30","359013"
"1557","Even though it’s fair to say that Pixels is on steadier ground than most of Sandler’s recent comedies, the film is nevertheless flat-footed and grows tedious after the first hour.","30","2120120"
"1558","For a movie premised on unrelenting action, Crank proves fatally turgid.","30","479884"
"1559","Gillespie stages his empathy for Tonya at arm’s length; he fails to respond to her experience in a direct, personal way. The result is a film that’s as derisive and dismissive toward Tonya Harding as it shows the world at large to have been.","30","5580036"
"1560","Treating one's audience like ignorant children in need of lecturing is hardly a way to win fans, or display one's own artistry.","30","1990217"
"1561","It falls short on character definition, emotional involvement, narrative drive and originality.","30","1335975"
"1562","The film goes by in a wash of uninspired action and unmemorable comedy.","30","1470023"
"1563","Behind the trademark fancy package is a troubling sensibility, too. Spielberg seems unable to come to terms with anything real.","30","92965"
"1564","Fast-paced editing doesn't compensate for unconvincing dialogue.","30","181984"

"1566","A tediously childish exhibition.","30","120655"
"1567","It's a failure, less because the odd stylistic mix doesn't take (it does from time to time, and to striking effect) than because Landis hasn't bothered to put his story into any kind of satisfying shape.","30","82010"
"1568","Unlike ""The Lost Boys,"" there are no bloodsuckers in Twelve. Instead, it just sucks time: 98 minutes to be exact that you can never get back.","30","1407084"
"1569","The film veers back and forth between the obvious and the ridiculous.","30","491175"
"1570","It works only sporadically, and more as a comic outing than as a vicious battle of sexual predation.","30","139134"
"1571","A movie that’s full of sound, fury and unintentional camp -- and is still bafflingly inert.","30","780653"
"1572","Though we are largely spared Leonard Nimoy's stentorian presence as a performer, we must endure his miscalculations as a director: the dialogue scenes are often hilariously turgid; the action scenes—when Nimoy can be bothered to descend from his podium and film them—are zanily maladroit.","30","88170"
"1573","It just isn't a Meg Ryan movie unless she's got male.","30","35423"

"1575","Overwrought and unpleasant nonsense.","30","118636"
"1576","There's something offensive about how Mamet continues to win praise as a serious filmmaker with such a joyless picture, a picture that -- intentionally -- gives the audience so little.","30","252503"
"1577","Torpedoed by its own overarching idealism -- the film targets the new star system, the media, the studios, digital technology, and pretty much everything else you might care to think of -- and not enough script to back it all up.","30","258153"
"1578","A disappointingly dull thud of a fantasy.","30","319061"
"1579","At least White summons the camp energy that Lake Placid is fecklessly seeking.","30","139414"
"1580","Kevin Costner’s Robin Hood is a Robin of wood. Murky and uninspired, this $50 million rendition bears evidence of the rushed and unpleasant production circumstances that were much reported upon.","30","102798"
"1581","A feeble sequel to The Naked Gun that's about one and a half rungs down from its predecessor and a good four or five down from Airplane!","30","102510"
"1582","A brightly wrapped, ketchup-drenched mush-burger, it slides down the Zeitgeist esophagus like a slippery McPelican. You pay, you swallow, you drive home. You're left with nothing except, possibly, heartburn.","30","107798"
"1583","Here Von Sydow's a rival beer manufacturer hoping to take over the world by drugging his brew, but the plotline (derived from Hamlet) soon goes flat.","30","86373"

"1585","Loses touch with its characters.","30","161081"
"1586","(Perry) style is too crude and stagy for Shange's transformative evocation of black female life, and his moralizing strikes exactly the wrong notes to express the pain and longing that cries out from her heated poetry.","30","1405500"

"1588","From the look of this film, its prime appreciators will be heavy-metal futurist dweebs.","30","120891"
"1589","Weightless. It is also, unfortunately, without much point at all... A movie of random effects and little accumulative impact.","30","100150"
"1590","The director gives us not just a pop Holocaust but a prettified, palatable Holocaust.","30","118799"
"1591","A sci-fi confection that, at best, momentarily recalls the dystopian whimsy of the director’s best-loved effort, “Brazil,” but ends up dissolving into a muddle of unfunny jokes and half-baked ideas, all served up with that painful, herky-jerky Gilliam rhythm.","30","2333804"
"1592","The few halfway decent ideas in the story (by John Skip, Craig Spector, and Leslie Bohem) and production design (by C.J. Strawn) are mercilessly and fatally crushed by the inept direction of Stephen Hopkins and the flaccid editing.","30","97981"
"1593","Clocking in at just 96 minutes, Sword of Destiny feels heavily truncated, lacking in narrative substance. Scant characterisation and timid action choreography don’t help matters, while an over-reliance on simple sets and CGI landscapes mean Grant Major’s (The Lord of the Rings) production design lacks the resonance of the previous film.","30","2652118"
"1594","The actual movie is the cinematic equivalent of cheap Chinese egg rolls: all flour and cabbage shreds, maybe half a nibble of pork.","30","271367"
"1595","The movie, directed by Gavin O’Connor (“Tumbleweeds”), makes little sense. The screenplay, by Bill Dubuque, is so determined to hide its cards that when the big reveal finally arrives, it feels as underwhelming as it is preposterous.","30","2140479"
"1596","Director Robert Luketic telegraphs every dismal comic beat from Venus and Mars, then reinforces them with a twinkling, leering score.","30","1142988"
"1597","The whole picture is edited and scored as if it were a lollapalooza of laughs. And, with Murphy busting his sides guffawing in self-congratulation, and the camera jammed into his tonsils, damned if the audience doesn't whoop and carry on as if yes, this is a wow of a comedy. [24 Dec. 1984, p.78]","30","86960"
"1598","It's a shame when an actor like Sylvester Stallone, who's always at his most appealing when he just hunkers down and lets himself be a big galoot, feels he has to make a bid for respectability.","30","118887"
"1599","Dismal SF deep think that gave birth to an equally dismal string of sequels and TV spin-offs.","30","63442"

"1604","The first and possibly the last Will Ferrell star vehicle. It's a clumsy, tedious ride that wears out its welcome as it wears out the seat of your pants and the circulation in your lower limbs.","30","319343"
"1605","I’m also guessing Kendrick did not want to come back. I’ve never seen her so flat-out bad — distracted, depressed, conviction-less. Anna, I still adore you, but you should have tried to make it work.","30","2848292"
"1606","The movie has the sense of being embalmed, or pickled. With its stilted dialogue not quite kitschy enough to be funny and not quite authentic enough to be realistic, the whole movie feels as if it's taking place in formaldehyde.","30","297884"
"1607","The state of mind brought on by Speed Racer the movie is more akin to that phenomenon by which young infants, exposed to more stimuli than their systems are equipped to handle, will simply shut down.","30","811080"
"1608","It's camp noir, but the director, Renny Harlin, doesn't allow the jokes, feeble as they are, to take hold. He slam-bangs the action as if he was prepping ""Die Hard 2,"" so that even Clay's self-infatuated strut and bleary leer don't have time to register. The film is pointlessly souped up.

"1609","A lumbering and depressing movie.","30","884328"
"1610","Cage's avenger is named Milton; this reference to the author of Paradise Lost is the sole hint that Old World culture ever existed in Drive Angry's convoy of hyperbolized-unto-parody Americana: bad drawls, obese gawkers, roadhouse demonology, coochie-cutter shorts, and engines revving under guitar stomp.","30","1502404"

"1613","His point here seems to be that voyeurism can induce a trancelike emotional paralysis—a message feminists could appreciate if Body Double took less pleasure in the mechanics of mutilation, and that ordinary moviegoers could ponder if the characters' motivations were not so numbingly nitwit. Upscale sleaze—so what else is new?","30","86984"

"1628","Shyamalan is clearly a director-for-hire here, his disinterest palpable from first frame to last. Nowhere in evidence is the gifted ""Sixth Sense"" director who once brought intricately crafted setpieces and cinematic sleight-of-hand to even the least of his own movies.","30","1815862"
"1629","The Coens are uncharacteristically restrained. Indeed, given that the crime comedy is their preferred genre, The Ladykillers is remarkable mainly for its timidity.","30","335245"
"1630","Plays like one long, slow descent into cloying moralizing and uplift that's well past its expiration date.","30","1349451"
"1631","Plays less like an exposé than a piece of exploitation, its clear divide between good and evil allowing no breathing room for real drama.","30","251160"
"1632","The action sequences reek of drudgery rather than adventure, and with the exception of Chiklis's remarkably soulful performance beneath 60 pounds of orange Thing makeup, all of the characters are flatter than their two-dimensional counterparts.","30","120667"
"1633","Blandly internationalized, generically derivative, drained of any personality, edited as if by computer and bleached of the slightest hint of emotion other than a holiday card-like sympathy for children and allegedly cute animals, The Meg is a one hundred percent inorganic meal, something made from pre-tasted and then regurgitated ingredients.","30","4779682"

"1640","Misogynistic claptrap about a divorced husband (Dustin Hoffman) fighting for the custody of and learning to cope with his little boy (Justin Henry) - a movie whose classy trimmings (including Nestor Almendros's cinematography) persuaded audiences to regard writer-director Robert Benton as a subtle art-house director.","30","79417"

"1650","Redford underacts, Gandolfini overacts, and this movie is directed with the same air of unreality, the same grim passion for cliches, both cinematic and emotional, that Lurie brought to his first film, ""The Contender.""","30","272020"
"1651","Come the end of the year, Above the Law may well rank among the top three or four goofiest bad movies of 1988.","30","94602"
"1652","Blue Jasmine is so relentlessly clueless about the ways real human beings live, and so eager to make the same points about human nature that Allen has made dozens of times before, that it seems like a movie beamed from another planet.","30","2334873"
"1653","The so-called long take serves as a mask—a gross bit of earnest showmanship that both conceals and reflects the trickery and the cheap machinations of the script, the shallowness of the direction of the actors, and the brazenly superficial and emotion-dictating music score.","30","8579674"
"1654","This movie will not find an audience. It's got likable stars, a reliable commercial genre and a decent supporting cast, but nobody will turn out to see it, even if it was a labor of love.","30","1405365"

"1658","Midnight Express is an outrageously sensationalistic movie version of a non-fiction cautionary tale, Billy Hays' account of his imprisonment in Turkey after being convicted for drug smuggling. Parker has upset the book's delicate sense of balance. He uses Hays' dilemma as a springboard for sensationalism, especially sustained depictions of brutality and hysteria. Midnight Express sets a new standard in shamelessness. [28 Oct 1978, p.B6]","30","77928"
"1659","The latest in a numbing series begun in 1978 by John Carpenter, and repeated five times since, with only a few plot and casting changes to detract from the brilliant slice-and-dice work of its masked hero.

"1660","Technically and comedically strained by the demands of its special effects-filled haunted house setting. Worse, the need to top the first pic's outlandish stunts is ghoulishly unfulfilled and terribly ironic.","30","257106"
"1661","Manipulative, feel-good drivel wrapped around a cloying performance by Kevin Spacey.","30","272152"
"1662","This is manufactured sentiment, less interested in provoking thought than in manipulating emotion, constructed of human obstacles overcome, stirring speeches delivered and heart-rending flashbacks unveiled, all suspended like so much Spam in the jelly of its own score.","30","2404425"
"1663","It's just a standard, mediocre horror flick that wants to be taken seriously. The creators missed the point entirely: even teenagers know that there's no audience for this type of film anymore.","30","144814"
"1664","The effort shows in all three performances. Spontaneity is in short supply. The comedy seems willed, the solemnity mechanical, the dialogue rhythms awkward and self-conscious.","30","6018306"
"1665","Their splashy gore is more convincing than this incompetent horror-comedy's attempt to mock bourgeois high school dissoluteness without appearing judgmental.","30","138510"

"1669","A viewer is challenged to guess what the filmmakers thought they were doing. A 1930s screwball comedy with a modern sensibility? A misguided valentine to those who march to the beat of a different drummer?","30","881891"
"1670","Silly, overlong, and bloody as hell, Orphan is likely to turn a sweet profit, money that Leo (DiCaprio), the renowned do-gooder, should spend with shame.","30","1148204"

"1675","Straining to capture artistic frenzy, it descends into vulgar chaos, less a homage to Federico Fellini’s “8 ½” (its putative inspiration) than a travesty.","30","875034"
"1676","Black Rain is the sort of movie where, if you see a motorcycle race at the start, you know you'll get one in the climax. The script is routine formula swill, at best. [02 Oct 1989, p.70]","30","96933"
"1677","Even though She’s Out of My League ends exactly where you think it will, it does so without ever having actually gone anywhere at all.","30","815236"
"1678","This movie feels like it was made by a bank rather than a person.","30","114898"
"1679","Every moment is hyped for maximum visual and visceral impact, but Scott doesn't display the slightest bit of interest (or belief) in the actual characters and situations.","30","92099"
"1680","I’m a pretty easy scare, but I sat through this Pet Sematary mostly unbothered. Which is certainly not the takeaway one should have from an adaptation of a Stephen King novel, let alone the one that King has said frightens him more than anything else he’s written. In this new film, you almost can’t see what he was so afraid of.","30","837563"
"1681","All in all, it's like a bachelor's apartment: a complete mess.","30","308383"
"1682","The Toy, starring Richard Pryor, is a coarsened American remake of a deft French comedy of the same title, which starred Pierre Richard and passed this way five or six years ago. Fluctuating wildly between facetiousness and solicitude, the new version never comes close to reproducing the sane, lightweight charms of the original.","30","84809"
"1683","A totally unnecessary and extremely poor sequel to the original ""Halloween"". Although Dean Cundey's photography goes a long way toward recapturing the look of the first film, director Rick Rosenthal is no Carpenter, and the emphasis here is on graphic blood and gore rather than the skillful manipulation of the audience.","30","82495"
"1684","A well-polished cowpat that will confuse and bore those who know nothing about Shakespeare and incense those who know almost anything.","30","1521197"
"1685","If there are any dadaist cinephiles out there, perhaps they can reclaim Second Act as a multilayered masterpiece of illogic. Certainly the film seems destined to survive all future nuclear winters, enduring as a time capsule of humanity at its most pitiably pedestrian.","30","2126357"
"1686","Focusing almost solely on Lavoe's addictions (drugs and women, ho and hum), El Cantante is a garish, dispiriting bit of work--a mountain of biopic clichés snorted through the lens of a fidgety camera that never pauses long enough for us to get to like (or even know) the man responsible for making the Nuyorican sound a mainstream American commodity in the 1970s and early '80s.","30","458522"
"1687","With Steven Spielberg behind the camera, Ernest Cline’s book had potential to transcend its source material. It’s disheartening that the finished product is little more than the cinematic equivalent of a pop culture mashup tee, which takes cherished icons of film and coats them in garish CGI while clumsily smashing them against one another like a child playing with action figures.","30","1677720"
"1688","Cinematographer Thierry Arbogast is the real superhero; his homage to noir thrillers compensates for the spotty CGI and rescues the movie from sex-kitten kitsch.","30","327554"
"1689","Out of Sight engaged me less and less, until by the end I no longer cared which of the characters lived or died. Not even the engaging Jennifer Lopez, George Clooney, Albert Brooks, Don Cheadle, and Ving Rhames or the talented secondary cast can survive the abbreviations and last-minute shoehorning their characters receive.","30","120780"
"1690","McAdams glows, as always, but Bana looks drained: I guess all that time-shifting leaves its mark on the complexion as well as the soul.","30","452694"
"1691","An unsurprising, undistinguished piece of post-summer, pre-holiday detritus.","30","348836"
"1692","The film’s initial formulaic competence gives way to outright preposterousness rather quickly, hinging on idiot-plot character motivations.","30","3181822"
"1693","Humorless, charmless and flat.","30","117060"
"1694","Sphere, an unfathomable chowder of recycled science fiction and undersea thrillers, briefly bubbles with promise only to plummet into the murky depths. Weighed down by inconsistencies and pretensions, the tale founders like a stinky beluga.","30","120184"
"1695","The story ultimately feels too conventional, and the portrait of the artist is too shallow to stand as a compelling or convincing evocation of a complex mind.","30","102181"
"1696","It's saying something when Tom Arnold's performance is among the movie's highlights.","30","306685"
"1697","Martin Scorsese's obsession with a dubious mystique of masculinity turns Raging Bull into a ponderous work of metaphysical cinematic bull.","30","81398"
"1698","Strictly for the birds.","30","310357"
"1699","Of the star-studded cast, only Mark Ruffalo (playing Bruce Banner) and Robert Downey Jr. (as Iron Man) bring any personality to the place-holder dialogue. Overlong, monotonous, violent, and simple-minded, this is like one of those ""World's Biggest Gang Bang"" videos, except that no one onscreen appears to be enjoying himself.","30","848228"
"1700","An orgy of bloodletting and dismemberment that's more monotonous than shocking. Aja and Levasseur are to splatter what Liberace was to rhinestones: practitioners of gaud.","30","454841"
"1701","It feels thin. It's an empty tour de force, and what's dismaying about the picture is that the filmmakers... seem inordinately pleased with its hermetic meaninglessness.","30","101410"
"1702","Even the imaginative gore can't hide the musty scent of Todd Farmer's screenplay.","30","211443"
"1703","Miner doesn't linger over the multiple throat-slashings and skull-splittings. Comparatively speaking, he seems less bloodthirsty than the directors of Friday the 13th, The Exterminator or Mother's Day, to name only a few competitors of grosser gruesomeness. [13 May 1981, p.B6]","30","82418"
"1704","This slavishly faithful update... fails to tap into anything culturally specific or uniquely funny in its Pasadena setting or its theoretically looser, livelier black cast. And because the characters are so flat, we couldn't care less about the blows to their sense of propriety.","30","1321509"
"1705","A very well-made genre exercise, but I can’t understand why it’s been accorded so much importance, unless it’s because it strokes some ideological impulse.","30","477348"
"1706","Lorraine Gary has some affecting moments as Ellen, but Jaws the Revenge is mild and predictable, the very things an adventure movie should never be.","30","93300"
"1707","Generally I don’t mind a little recreational fascism as long as it’s deep-fried in savory violent vengeance, but this overwrought mess gives vigilantism a bad name.","30","1197624"
"1708","Such soft fare that it makes your eyes feel gummy. Andrew Bergman's script has no comic tension and no thrills. [3 June 1985, p.65]","30","89155"
"1709","BlacKkKlansman isn’t wrong about the evils of white supremacy. But it’s pretty sure you, out in the audience, aren’t going to get it unless it spells out the message in blinking neon lights. And even then, the film seems to fear you might miss the point.","30","7349662"
"1710","In The Hunger Games it's both a feast of cheesy spectacle and a famine of genuine feeling, except for the powerful - and touchingly vulnerable - presence of Jennifer Lawrence.","30","1392170"
"1711","Desperation is the project's principal quality, characterizing everything from the misfiring jokes to the surprisingly distinguished cast.","30","317640"
"1712","The enjoyable moments are limited to Alison Brie, funny as Sidney's publicist, and the final recasting of the movie as a backstage diva drama. As ever, the self-reflexive horror stuff is superficial, loveless, and constant-a ladled-on sauce to disguise what you're eating.","30","1262416"
"1713","Green Lantern was meant to be a sci-fi adventure, but it proves to be a genuine mystery. How could its megamoola budget have yielded a production that looks almost as tacky as ""Flash Gordon"" (which had the good grace to deprecate itself at every turn)?","30","1133985"
"1714","There are a few pretty good design effects en route, but not enough to compensate for all the embarrassments.","30","183523"
"1715","This kind of reverence kills what it seeks to preserve. The movie is embalmed.","30","409459"
"1716","The result is a mess. Kym, in Hathaway's unsympathetic performance, is an annoyingly sour observer of the proceedings, a time bomb everyone hopes will not explode before the marriage is completed.","30","1084950"
"1717","In the end, Unfaithful leaves you dispirited and grumpy: All that money spent, all that talent wasted, all that time gone forever, and for what? It's an ill movie that bloweth no man to good.","30","250797"
"1718","A deeply stupid and offensive action comedy-romance.","30","356910"
"1719","Logic, motivation, suspense -- anything that might make the film frightening or resonant -- is buried under Dolby blams, medulla-shaming dialogue, and a rain of overdubbed hunting-knife schwings that grate like a 3 a.m. car alarm.","30","134084"
"1720","Forty-five minutes in, I was already glancing at my watch and wondering why the only lively actress in this film was playing the dead girl. Go figure.","30","387877"
"1721","Despite Stallone's bantamweight attempts to insert, like, character into the fifth Rocky, it's the same old fight with the same old round of regulars. It seems silly wasting money on actors when the same could be achieved with Muppets. Rocky has little to do except shuffle around and mutter ""cute"" Rocky t'ings.","30","100507"
"1722","Thomas's fleet-footed approach suggests the anxious embarrassment of a director in an awful hurry to get it over with.","30","191754"
"1723","Despite Mr. Brosnan's best efforts to be lethally debonair, the Bond franchise has sacrificed most of what made this character unique in the first place, turning the world's suavest spy into one more pitchman and fashion plate. This latest film is such a generic action event that it could be any old summer blockbuster, except that its hero is chronically overdressed.","30","120347"
"1724","Consider this yet another nail in the Eighties coffin.","30","1231587"
"1725","Emits the embarrassing aura of a filmmaker desperate to be considered cool, yet utterly inept at finding original ways to reach that status.","30","208092"
"1726","The studio certainly needn't hire any brilliant writers; they have only to repeat the plot of the first film in every sequel.","30","87298"
"1727","Strip Star Wars of its often striking images and its highfalutin scientific jargon, and you get a story, characters, and dialogue of overwhelming banality, without even a “future” cast to them: Human beings, anthropoids, or robots, you could probably find them all, more or less like that, in downtown Los Angeles today. Certainly the mentality and values of the movie can be duplicated in third-rate non-science of any place or period.","30","76759"
"1728","What's lacking is the sense of emotional balance and urgency that the original Terminator, though just a B movie, was blessed with--the quality that earned it fans in the first place.","30","438488"
"1729","Snow White and the Huntsman, the first feature from British commercial director Rupert Sanders, has its work cut out for it if it wants to be a truly dull piece of junk - but it manages.","30","1735898"
"1730","A convoluted psychosexual thriller that promises the moon and gives us Bruce's butt.","30","109456"
"1731","After enduring 30 minutes of awful slapstick, shit jokes, gags revolving around used condoms, cholo caricatures, and women who are all psychos, sluts or Latina fuck-dolls, I walked.","30","195945"
"1732","Mimic is static, highhanded, and confused, wasting most of its 105-minute running time simply spelling out the premise.","30","119675"
"1733","Allen Coulter (Hollywoodland) directed this morose and sluggish drama, which gets more mileage from Pattinson's anguished profile than from Will Fetters's thunderously overwritten screenplay.","30","1403981"
"1734","Very much the cheap knockoff of its prototype, but not half as visceral.","30","95271"
"1735","A vaguely absurd epidemiological thriller filled with elaborately superfluous setups and shamelessly stale James Bond riffs.","30","120755"
"1736","It's exasperating watching so much top-drawer talent wasted in a film that wraps itself up with one of the most preposterous (not to mention obvious) endings the genre has ever seen.","30","368447"
"1737","The picture starts off slick and amusing, gets convoluted, draggy and strange round about the midway point, and ends up just plain ludicrous.","30","118971"
"1738","This mean-spirited invisible man movie tries to hide its poverty of fresh ideas behind a load of state-of-the-art special effects.","30","164052"
"1739","A triple-cross plot with Harris's superiors doesn't help the movie's clarity--neither does the clattering sound design. Shouldn't throwing stars be silent? If they're gonna sound like gunshots, why not just use guns?","30","1186367"
"1740","Neither the contemplative Zhivago nor the flux of events is intelligible, and what is worse, they seem unrelated to each other...It's stately, respectable, and dead.","30","59113"
"1741","In Troy, and in overreaching, underachieving productions like it, digital imagery is fast becoming both a Trojan horse and Achilles' heel.","30","332452"
"1742","A waste of a decent premise.","30","195714"
"1743","Summertime popcorn pictures don't get much goofier than this silly sequel, which is everything you'd expect and nothing you wouldn't.","30","266915"
"1744","The performers have little to do besides spill and drink blood in this tedious, inconsequential B picture. The sun doesn’t rise nearly fast enough.","30","389722"
"1745","By the end the movie audience, like the electorate, is less satisfied than strung-out and exhausted.","30","131369"
"1746","Any movie whose computer-generated effects are more believable than its actors is asking for trouble. A frustrating combination of the magical and the mundane, Dragonheart has less difficulty creating a creditable dragon than a recognizable human being. [31 May 1996, p.F1]","30","116136"
"1747","Following the lead tendered by the credited screenwriters, Steve Koren and Mark O'Keefe, the director Frank Coraci struggles to push the character toward the kind of age-appropriate complexity lost on Mr. Sandler, forgetting that his star only works when, as all those ponderous bosoms suggest, he's un-weaned.","30","389860"
"1748","Director Arthur Penn have elected to tell their tale of bullets and blood in a strange and purposeless mingling of fact and claptrap that teeters uneasily on the brink of burlesque. Like Bonnie and Clyde themselves, the film rides off'in all directions and ends up full of holes...The real fault with Bonnie and Clyde is its sheer, tasteless aimlessness.","30","61418"
"1749","A tearjerking romantic confection that, thanks to a reliance on unrestrained psychobabble and melodramatic one-upmanship, is only partially digestible.","30","225071"

"1752","You might call this the scattershot school of film making... The result of being pushed and pulled through the confusing styles of Near Dark is simple exhaustion.","30","93605"
"1753","There's no pea soup, but sketchy effects, cheap jolts, swirling cameras, and buckets of blood surround Exorcist: The Beginning with the potent aroma of cheese.","30","204313"
"1754","Loud, shiny, and critic-proof, this franchise launcher is basically Transformers minus the humanity. Dennis Quaid provides some ballast as grizzled patriarch to the troop of sexy young lock-and-loaders.","30","1046173"
"1755","Where Young's book was a slap in the face, this movie is a kick on the backside, all hokey humor and quaint lovability.","30","455538"
"1756","It exchanges the police subplot that gave the earlier film its steady pace for a lot of pointless backstory about the mother-fixated stalker.","30","454082"
"1757","Unfortunately, as the opening title might suggest, the filmmakers have punted on the hard cinematic work of making the incredible seem credible; instead they've turned Russell's story into a broad farce with one wocka-wocka gag after another.","30","1045772"
"1758","It’s all so glancing and superficial that the movie doesn’t seem to have a present tense. It goes by like coming attractions. It is, however, a treasury of bad biopic dialogue.","30","1129445"
"1759","After suffering through two screenings of Dr. Strangelove, I would sooner drink hemlock.... To me, Dr. Strangelove is an evil thing about an evil thing; you will have to make up your own mind about it.","30","57012"
"1760","What's most memorable about this plodding thriller are the copious amounts of foundation and lip gloss.","30","1265990"
"1761","Did I laugh? Yeah, I did, half a dozen times. Not a great percentage for a film with something close to 300 quote-unquote jokes.","30","175142"
"1762","But clever casting, and inspirational dieting, can't make up for this poor little rich girl's shortcomings as a comedienne. Under Mr. Benjamin's vulgar tutelage, she portrays Connie's coarseness coarsely, with an accent that seems to have come from Ida Lupino by way of Madonna. [19 Apr 1996, p.A11]","30","117104"
"1763","The really relevant defect of this thriller is that it isn't scary.","30","266697"
"1764","J. Michael Straczynski's disjointed script manages to ring false at almost every significant turn (Collins' psychiatric-hospital stay has grown into a latter-day version of ""The Snake Pit"") and Clint Eastwood's ponderous direction -- a disheartening departure from his sure touch in ""Letters From Iwo Jima"" and ""The Bridges of Madison County"" -- magnifies the flaws.","30","824747"
"1765","There’s ultimately too much strained seriousness in The Song of Names' dramatically flimsy and symbolically heavy episodic narrative, making Girard and Caine’s already dated feel-good historical drama seem especially tacky.","30","1657517"
"1766","Not a bad picture, just utterly banal.","30","174480"
"1767","Ends up leaving you starved for a single moment of unhyped emotion. You can barely see the characters for Luhrmann screaming.","30","203009"
"1768","This mumbo-jumbo plays like The X Files on Prozac. No wonder the actors look narcotized.","30","265349"
"1769","Call me the sarcastic sister, but the only things screaming in any convincing way here are the cheap look, epileptic direction and off-key, “edgy” humor. It’s all so ‘80s, I could die.","30","1232783"
"1770","When a movie wrenches you with the deaths of children then leaves you with nothing to take home but your confusion, it can make you thirsty for the blood of directors.","30","285742"
"1771","It's grave, lumbering, arrhythmic, and bloated, an emotional hogwallow of catchpenny insights and easy sentimentality...In short, a real bagful.","30","91738"
"1772","After introducing a provocative opening, the movie settles in for some pretty cheap scare effects, as well as by-the-numbers computer graphic imagery for the actual marauder.","30","263488"
"1773","Surely something more original than this could have been mined from the history of North America’s largest and most professional police force. As it is, though, Johnson’s film is just firing blanks.","30","257076"
"1774","It's the flat, self-exposing dud that fate often keeps in store for the initially overpraised. [26 Jan 1998, p.24]","30","119396"
"1775","There's a basic flaw in Malick's method: he has perceived the movie--he's done our work instead of his. In place of people and action, with metaphor rising out of the story, he gives us a surface that is all conscious metaphor. Badlands is so preconceived that there's nothing left to respond to. [18 March 1974, p.135]","30","69762"
"1776","An offering so endearingly lame it seems to have missed the past 10 years' worth of special-effects breakthroughs.","30","253754"
"1777","Trudging nobly under a mantle of impeccably earnest intentions and a fussy, too-quaint-by-half production design, Honeydripper lags and drags to its utterly predictable end. There's not a spark of spontaneity or soul about it.","30","829193"
"1778","You don’t appreciate the art of a good genre contrivance until you see one pulled off poorly.","30","2737304"
"1779","This abattoir of a movie boasts sledgehammers, meathooks and chainsaws, and the result, though not especially visceral, is noisy, relentless, and about as subtle as having your leg sawed off without anaesthetic. It's notable only for taking woman-in-jeopardy about as far as she can go.","30","72271"
"1780","Unrelentingly grim, unremittingly gross and unforgivably unattractive, 28 Days Later is an orgy of troubling images and bestial sound effects.","30","289043"
"1781","Deception would be laughably bad if it weren't so rotely inert.","30","800240"
"1782","Allan Loeb’s script is glib and grating.","30","460890"
"1783","Reasonably well-made and all, but it's simply too familiar, too derivative and too inferior to its predecessors to have any reason to exist.","30","245120"
"1784","The premise is admittedly a killer--fun to think about, fun to see realized, not so fun to see screwed up in the last half-hour.","30","183649"
"1785","Though Hard Candy clearly believes pedophiles should be chopped into little pieces and buried in an unmarked grave, its only purpose is exploitative. Sure, it's a cautionary tale for all those sicko wolves out there, but it's nothing more than an unabashed lurk-and-dread fest.","30","424136"
"1786","Meant to be funny, but it only swells the sinus passages. It is a painfully inept comedy.","30","96928"
"1787","Mean-spirited.","30","480687"
"1788","As always, the teen actors are disposable, and even Robert Englund seems to be sleepwalking through Freddy. In the best Nightmares, Parts 1 and 3, the bad dreams not only made sense, but reinforced the idea of pattern psychosis and brought viewers into the dreamscapes. In 4 they're just cold splashes in the face.","30","95742"
"1789","Charlize Theron has charm and skill, but no actress could survive this role, which has the gravity and verisimilitude of a sketch from a late-sixties Nancy Sinatra TV special.","30","230838"
"1790","A brain-dead version of a dark and complex work.","30","120681"
"1791","Just about the only good thing you can say about Spike Lee's pointless, didactic The 25th Hour is that it's filled with strong performances, albeit of stock characters.","30","307901"
"1792","A saga of static set pieces and strenuously clever notions, this is a fiasco of a film if ever there was one.","30","368709"
"1793","Big, cruel, stupid actioner.","30","493464"
"1794","This movie is a predictable, gruesome piece of business.","30","328107"
"1795","The movie is so disturbing that it seems nearly blasphemous. I wouldn't wish it on an anthrax spore. After all, anthrax has feelings, too.","30","264616"
"1796","Icky, nasty, calculatingly odd and a little funny, though more often strained and inadvertently absurd, After.Life changes its mood and apparent intentions from scene to scene, sometimes minute to minute.","30","838247"
"1797","I hated this movie; I wish I could unsee it and will it out of existence. But that’s not the same as thinking it’s worthless or corrupt or entirely inept. It’s more like a massively self-indulgent prank, inflicted on the world by some reasonably intelligent young men, which makes it the most bro-tastic project of all time. Mo’ bro than this, no es posible, amigos.","30","1700841"
"1798","A pretty woeful affair...a sitcom disguised as a movie.","30","122933"
"1799","The tediously convoluted plot involves the foursome’s attempt to pay him back, a labored venture that involves crooks with names like Dog and Plank, a man on fire, some fine cinematography, plenty of gore though no real point.","30","120735"
"1800","We don’t ask for much from this kind of movie, but Knight and Day tramples on our desire for just enough plausibility to release the fun. It makes us feel like fools for wanting to be entertained by froth.","30","1013743"
"1801","Marshall is the very definition of a hack; his one and only desire is to play to the lowest common denominator. This is the secret of his success: He aspires to mediocrity. With Runaway Bride, he has scored another bull's-eye.","30","163187"
"1802","With this odd mixture of elements the film's tone is gloomy, portentous, and hysterical, yet at the same time strangely earnest and square, as if David Lynch had tried to somehow make a movie version of Scientific American.","30","138704"
"1803","There is no purpose to the film other than random blood splattering amid scenes of bondage, primitive savagery and S&M eroticism. The film is numbing and dumb with its hero indistinguishable from its villains.","30","816462"
"1804","Written and directed by Tom Six--who doesn't seem to realize that movie theaters rely on popcorn sales--this nasty stuff plays like a cross between ""Saw,"" ""Naked Lunch,"" and ""Bride of the Monster.""","30","1467304"
"1805","This animated-live action hybrid is really more 3-D disaster than family comedy. Even Neil Patrick Harris, who has proved he can save just about any sinking ship, cannot make this boat float.","30","472181"
"1806","There's neither intricacy nor surprise in the narrative, and these dopes are tedious, witless company. Mostly you find yourself thinking, ""How long until dinner?""","30","120324"
"1807","As usual, though, the Coens have more venal satisfactions in mind. ""The fun of the story for us,"" they crow in the notes for this loathsome movie, ""was inventing new ways to torture Larry.""","30","1019452"
"1808","Sadly, the whole affair is little more than ennui with a pedigree.","30","465551"
"1809","More concerned with attitude than character and too moralistic to be much fun.","30","375173"
"1810","There are many ways for a movie to go wrong, and Tomb Raider goes wrong in many of the most obvious: It has a generic story, bad writing, a miscast lead, the wrong director and no fun.","30","1365519"
"1811","All the sound and fury in the world can't disguise the fact that yowling music, typing montages and computer animation do not a gripping finale make. This movie megabytes.","30","113243"
"1812","Screenwriter Akiva Goldsman has written quips, not characters and Joel Schumacher still seems miscast as a Bat-action director: he stages the mayhem confusingly and the comedy too broadly.","30","118688"
"1813","Airy, pseudo-folkloric gibberish at best.","30","241303"
"1814","Jarhead virtually begins with a rip-off of the basic-training sequence that opens Stanley Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket.""","30","418763"
"1815","There's some sort of gross egotism involved in linking great music to visuals that are so unabashedly kitschy.","30","120910"
"1816","Wears off in about 10.8 minutes.","30","443274"
"1817","Not enough to keep this celluloid ship from sinking under the weight of its own stupidity.","30","325980"
"1818","Well, it could have been good. But this goofy homage to Kiss fans gets dry mouth pretty fast.","30","165710"
"1819","It might even have made a good film, but it hasn't. In the hands of stars in denial about their stardom and a director who can't be bothered to take things seriously, it has come out implausible and unsatisfying, a comic thriller that is not especially funny or thrilling.","30","118883"
"1820","My real problem with Matchstick Men is that it didn't con me well enough: I saw every trick up its sleeve in the first 20 minutes. If everything had been what it seemed--now, that would have been a stunning twist.","30","325805"
"1821","They try to get 'real' about strange occurrences. Instead they get ludicrous.","30","1220198"

"1823","Biographical stinker that insists on remaining unreasonably disjointed for 2 1/2 hours. [28 Jan 1983, p.D1]","30","83967"
"1824","One could watch Honey Boy musing that it must be nice to have someone finance a movie of your 12-step qualification. That assessment is actually too generous.","30","8151874"
"1825","Tobe Hooper's remake of Invaders from Mars is an embarrassing combination of kitsch and boredom.","30","91276"
"1826","A bad movie that a lot of people will like... Though director Jerry Zucker wants his necrophiliac romance to be sensitive, he pumps up its feelings fortissimo so the dimmest viewer will get the point. [16 July 1990, p.86]","30","99653"
"1827","The New World is a disaster, moans Queen Isabella. Yes, that's about right.","30","103594"
"1828","A low-voltage drive-in movie, made strictly by the book.","30","146336"
"1829","There are a couple of entertaining action sequences, including the climactic battle between the cop and the Predator. The special effects, all shot on film, and the makeup effects, are top-notch for the time they appeared, so as a historical record the movie is interesting. But it just doesn't have enough meat to sate a hungry hunter.","30","100403"
"1830","The perceptive dramatic touches of Fonda and Redford take the stereotypical edge off the stock characters of ""cowboy"" and ""career girl."" But these serve ridiculous story making a mushy, if not disreputable, moral point. [21 Dec 1979, p.32]","30","79100"
"1831","The murder-mystery board game becomes a frantic, unfunny spoof (1985) under the direction of British TV writer Jonathan Lynn. The script recycles Agatha Christie's Ten Little Indians, with six guests invited by a mysterious host to spend the night in a creepy mansion, but instead of parodying the material Lynn simply surrounds it with extraneous pratfalls and wisecracks.","30","88930"
"1832","As scripted by Craig Titley, this first in a presumptive franchise is a dull, scattershot affair that owes much to both ""X-Men"" and Greek mythology, but which never seems to slow down enough to make any sense whatsoever.","30","814255"
"1833","You wonder what he has up his sleeve in The Hateful Eight, but gorgeous as that sleeve might be, what’s up it is crap. The movie is a lot of gore over a lot of nothing. I hope that won’t be Tarantino’s epitaph.","30","3460252"
"1834","In the end, everything about this glum and self-important adaptation of Anne Tyler's upper-cute novel is dim. [26 Dec 1988, p.83]","30","94606"
"1835","Manic energy is the term that comes most readily to mind when describing Ace Ventura.","30","109040"
"1836","The film is often unintentionally silly, and it might have been better if it tried to be.","30","120647"
"1837","Tedium overwhelms caring well before this endless film finally concludes.","30","280707"
"1838","Overall, though, the flashes of competence just emphasize the extent to which the film has no idea what it's doing.","30","1131734"
"1839","By embracing the Roman pageant so openly, using all the emotional resources of cinema, Gibson has cancelled out the redemptive and transfiguring power of art. [1 March 2004, p. 84]","30","335345"
"1840","It's apparent that someone connected with They Came From Within has an impertinent sense of humor even though the film is so tackily written and directed, so darkly photographed and the sound so dimly recorded, that it's difficult to stay with it.","30","73705"
"1841","What audiences end up with word-wise is a hackneyed, completely derivative copy of old Hollywood romances, a movie that reeks of phoniness and lacks even minimal originality.","30","120338"
"1842","Most of the actors seem to have been issued one facial expression at the beginning of the film, along with pain-of-death instructions not to change it under any circumstance.","30","142688"
"1843","This may not be as ill considered as it sounds--some of the sharpest material in Rock's last concert special, ""Never Scared,"" dealt with the eternal conflict between men and women--but his crowd-pleasing gags tend to clash with Rohmer's sly moral comedy.","30","770772"
"1844","Coming so close on the heels of another clumsy female-led spy adaptation, ""Atomic Blonde"" (which at least had the good grace to be stylish in its stupidity), Red Sparrow plummets to Earth.","30","2873282"
"1845","But the screenplay for this deliberately over-the-top (under-the-bottom?) farce—about Carrey's unwitting retrieval of some ransom money and his effort to return it to his dream gal (Lauren Holly) in Aspen—doesn't pass muster as a string of moronic skits (studded with urine and fart jokes) or as a lampoon of buddy movies.","30","109686"
"1846","Slack direction from Walt Becker (National Lampoon's Van Wilder) sullies this formula comedy, but the cast is agreeable.","30","486946"
"1847","Everyone learns a lesson by movie’s end: Don’t put work before family. Curiously, no one learns that all this could have been avoided with a good method of birth control.","30","349205"
"1848","Shot after shot photographed at wobbly, off-center angles for no particular reason, weigh every action sequence down with super-slo-mo in lame imitation of ""The Matrix"" or end every single scene with a vertical wipe.","30","185183"
"1849","Which would be fine, were the characters not a punchable quintet of overdrawn saps, the acting (Ringwald and Hall excepted) overplayed and unsympathetic, and the script the wrong side of the line that separates smart from smart-arse. Its continuing cult popularity is mystifying; as teen movies go, this is a long way off, say, Fast Times at Ridgemont High or Pretty in Pink. Hughes: stay behind for detention afterwards. And write me four sides on why this, uh, sucks.","30","88847"
"1850","As performers, they both are so aggressive, so creepy and off‐putting, that Harold and Maude are obviously made for each other, a point the movie itself refuses to recognize with a twist ending that betrays, I think, its life‐affirming pre tensions.","30","67185"
"1851","Likely to appeal only to undiscriminating nudity-- and gore -- starved adolescents.","30","288477"
"1852","Alejandro González Iñárritu is a pretentious fraud, but it’s taken some time to understand the precise nature of his fraudulence.","30","2562232"
"1853","The role requires Wahlberg to run the gamut of emotions from A to A.","30","467197"
"1854","The very idea of handing him over to professional lad Guy Ritchie (who directed Snatch, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels), to be played as a punch-throwing quipster by Robert Downey Jr., is so profoundly stupid one can only step back in dismay.","30","988045"
"1855","Cowboys versus aliens is a concept that may make you smile in anticipation, but wipe that smile off your face before buying your ticket.","30","409847"
"1856","Considering the void at the center of his character, Reeves isn't bad. He's worked up some tricky robotic movements but his dialogue can't match their invention. [26 May 1995, p.F1]","30","113481"
"1857","Class, a sexual disillusion acted out at the prep school level, would be represented far more accurately by the one-word title ""Crass."" [22 July 1983, p.C4]","30","85346"
"1858","It's an English movie doing its best to masquerade as the shallowest kind of Hollywood romantic comedy, as if somewhere along the way someone had made a calculated supposition that would be the only kind of comedy American audiences would buy.","30","125439"
"1859","Crowe has made a meretricious weepie that rouges the facts and defeats the attempts of Matt Damon, with his considerable charm and skill, to breathe some emotional truth into it. There's a word for the strenuous, shameless plucking of an audience's emotions that this movie traffics in: cornography.","30","1389137"
"1860","Since none of the characters makes sense even on the movie's own terms, Highlander keeps on exploding for almost two hours, with nothing at stake.","30","91203"
"1861","Ultimately, the plot-point overload dilutes any palpable sense of dread, excitement or empathy, and it doesn't help that all the dialogue acts in service to either patronizing exposition or turgid interpersonal drama.","30","881320"
"1862","Like the dead dog that it is, though, Pet Sematary deserves to be buried very, very deep.","30","105128"
"1863","Once the film devolves into teary hospital scenes and courtroom shtik, you might pine for Thelma and Louise's daring road to oblivion. [20 Feb 1995, Pg.72]","30","112571"
"1864","It's all a bit of overkill.","30","185371"
"1865","Lars and the Real Girl wobbles in a slow, toneless no-man's-land between mawkish and schmaltzy while trafficking shamelessly in heartland stereotypy.","30","805564"
"1866","After 9/11, few of us look at terrorist acts casually. It's insulting to watch this grandiloquent pornography, using shock value and Hollywood cliche to evoke poignancy.","30","453467"
"1867","Good-natured fun when it isn't stale, which is most of the time, this talky comedy set in a Chicago barber shop is a sitcom pilot disguised as a movie.","30","303714"
"1868","This comedy is an ill-fated attempt to remake ""Risky Business"" (1983) for the 21st century, complete with a wind-chimey score, the hero posing in his underpants, and a cynical happy ending.","30","265208"
"1869","Steve and Doug's story just isn't funny, and it would take far better writing than Kattan, Ferrell and Steve Koren can muster to make it less than an ordeal.","30","120770"
"1870","Marc Forster takes a maximalist approach to this mumbo jumbo, which means that in addition to lots of wacky angles, shiny surfaces, seemingly endless stairs, and sets of twins, triplets and quadruplets, he deploys the unsettling vision of three talented actors - Ewan McGregor, Naomi Watts and Ryan Gosling - straining credulity and neck tendons in the service of serious claptrap.","30","371257"
"1871","A thoroughly bland and mediocre movie about the Cuban missile crisis.","30","146309"
"1872","Like much of Ms. Cody’s work, Paradise plays out in quippy sound bites, only this time they feel entirely unsuited to Lamb’s sheltered background.","30","1262990"
"1873","If you can get past the goofy writing, there's lots of noisy action in The Punisher, but little of it is particularly exhilarating. In fact, it's more of an endurance test. If you can sit through it, you should consider yourself duly punished.","30","330793"
"1874","Brown and now Ron Howard have added an incendiary element to trash--open hostility toward the Catholic Church.","30","808151"
"1875","Even though the target of satire in Jojo Rabbit is clearly the Nazis, the movie sharply but unintentionally satirizes itself, as well as its makers and the movie industry at large that saw fit to produce, release, and acclaim it.","30","2584384"
"1876","The film has no discipline, but that's okay because it has no suspense, either.","30","120399"
"1877","Psychologically thin, artistically flabby, and symbolically opaque.","30","120684"
"1878","There are several requirements for you to enjoy Sister Act. Your love of Whoopi Goldberg must be infinite. The thought of her in nun's habit must be an automatic scream. Finally, your ability to forgive bad comedy needs to be celestial.","30","105417"
"1879","The screenplay is priceless (funny) and it's Mr. Reeve who sets the film's tone. Unfortunately, his unshadowed good looks, granite profile, bright naivete and eagerness to please - the qualities that made him such an ideal Superman - look absurd here.","30","81534"
"1880","Carpenter spends so much time turning the screws on the next scare that he completely forsakes his actors, who are already stranded with a shoddy script.","30","93777"
"1881","Depending on your taste, either much hilarity or a tedious barrage of tasteless, juvenile pranking ensues. Trust your instincts.","30","118689"
"1882","While director Aronofsky pistol-whips your attention with his style, the characters (mostly relegated to human mannequins in Aronofsky's visual schemes) suffer big time.","30","180093"
"1883","Caruso and Spielberg probably thought they were reviving the paranoid style of 70s political thrillers, but their story is so implausible it barely provokes a tremor.","30","1059786"
"1884","Director Adrian Lyne has encapsulated the cliches of three decades in a single dreadful and hysterical movie.","30","99871"
"1885","But humans who live above ground, including horror fans, will find themselves only fitfully entertained and more consistently appalled.","30","387564"
"1886","This kind of wheel spinning comes from having the desire to speak but nothing much to say, and Smith, who's made a slight movie about his being a slight filmmaker, seems to know this.","30","261392"
"1887","The script, by Nolan and his brother Jonathan, takes a few vague pokes at Wall Street and the financial elite but mainly revives the ponderous psychodrama of the first movie.","30","1345836"
"1888","Summer is like an episode of the religious children's series ""Davey and Goliath,"" without the entertainment value of animation and a talking dog.","30","286162"
"1889","Apatow has drifted further and further from comedy with every film, but This is 40 is the first where he hasn't even bothered to write any jokes. Instead of snappy dialogue, we get lazy exchanges.","30","1758830"
"1890","The failures of White Squall are dismaying as well as perplexing. Director Ridley Scott serves up some ravishing images along the way: the stark geometry of the ship's riggings against an azure sky, crew kids scampering along a verdant ridge toward a volcano's silvery crater lake. But the script is a shambles. [06 Feb 1996]","30","118158"
"1891","Audiard himself might have benefited from a simple reminder of left from right; his rudderless film confuses a pileup of preposterous, sentimental scenarios with genuine emotion.","30","2053425"
"1892","Friends, Washingtonians, countrymen, I come not to praise Gladiator but to bury it.","30","172495"
"1893","What's most troubling about this witless mishmash of whiny, infantile philosophizing and bone-crunching violence is the increasing realization that it actually thinks it's saying something of significance.","30","137523"
"1894","It's hard to tell whether Spielberg and Lucas are trying too hard or trying at all--the thing's such a mess, such an unmitigated disaster, that damned is the scholar stuck with the unfortunate task of deciphering this cynical, clinical gibberish in decades to come.","30","367882"
"1895","Goofy and gee-whiz when it isn't being post-apocalyptic glum, it is such an earnest hodgepodge that only by imagining ""Mad Max"" directed by Frank Capra can you get even an inkling of what it's like.","30","119925"
"1896","Passionately anticipated and much ballyhooed, the film, alas, is little more than a foppish, fang de siecle costume drama. Its pulse barely registers.","30","110148"
"1897","Scorsese designs his own form of alienation in this mistimed, empty movie, which seems to teeter between jokiness and hate.","30","85794"
"1898","As ""Saw"" demonstrated, Wan and Whannell have a carnivalesque sense of fun and a sure instinct for recycling classic horror tropes, but their characters are so flat and their plotting so listless that this low-budget feature fails to generate much suspense.","30","455760"
"1899","Amusing premise, not-so-amusing execution.","30","372532"
"1900","Dead Men Tell No Tales is the sort of sequel that’s so bad it makes you retroactively wonder why you liked the original film so much in the first place.","30","1790809"
"1901","West (Con Air) saturates his imagery in a sickly, sulphurous stew of rotten-egg yellows and oranges, making a mediocre picture downright repellent at times.","30","472399"
"1902","Too long winded and dull.","30","119381"
"1903","Never comes close to making the case that its subject is worthy of the viewer's interest.","30","125664"
"1904","The endless hidden connections and coincidences eventually become ridiculous.","30","1536437"
"1905","Despite its noir references and evocations, this slick film, directed by Tony Scott from Quentin Tarantino's script, is a preposterously bloody mess, as is the plot.","30","108399"
"1906","Considerably less of a thrillgasm than playing ""Frogger"" blindfolded.","30","1034032"
"1907","Big, dull and empty -- nobody associated with this production appears to have thought hard about storytelling.","30","295297"
"1908","The script, written by the actress, is downright wretched at times.","30","3760922"
"1909","Cronenberg is a master of creating and sustaining a mood of insinuating cool and dark allure, but while the director remains firmly behind the wheel for the first hour or so, he cracks up toward the end with sequences that send the film and the audience into a ditch.","30","115964"
"1910","It feels at once overwritten and thematically thin, coasting on a cutesy concept before descending into relentless, and therefore meaningless, violence.","30","2091935"
"1911","The lameness of the gags and dialogue and the film's frequent deep dives for the bottom at the expense of real comedy speak to desperation in Hollywood to figure out the audience for contemporary naughty comedy.","30","1499658"
"1912","Unfortunately, Ms. Faris has neither an adroit script -- House Bunny is a stale collection of dumb bunny jokes -- nor Ms. Witherspoon's wily charm. And the filmmakers do Ms. Faris no favors by inviting comparisons to Marilyn Monroe.","30","852713"
"1913","A roaring snooze that should by all rights be edge-of-your-seat, compelling cinema, Mark Felt lives and dies by Landesman’s laborious script, which revels in the minutiae of the scandal without ever managing an iota of passion.","30","5175450"
"1914","If claustrophobia's your style, The Jacket is a perfect fit.","30","366627"
"1915","Villeneuve is trying like hell to elevate what turns out to be a dumb genre picture.","30","1392214"
"1916","Everything he (Nolan) does is forced and overthought, and Inception, far from being his ticket into hall-of-fame greatness, is a very expensive-looking, elephantine film whose myriad so-called complexities -- of both the emotional and intellectual sort -- add up to a kind of ADD tedium.","30","1375666"
"1917","About an hour after you've seen it, you'll already be fuzzy on just who was screwing who, and why","30","184858"
"1918","Made me laugh precisely once, as a magazine editor let fly with a Diane Arbus gag. It is no coincidence that she is played by Candice Bergen, who gets just the one scene, but who is nonetheless the only bona-fide movie star on show.","30","1000774"
"1919","V for Vendetta is a dud - far too long at nearly two and a half hours, with flat, grungy visuals, choppy editing and no sense of urgency. But as a political work, it's something else - heavy-handed, reactionary and flat-out stupid. (For the record, Moore has publicly distanced himself from the film, saying it bears precious little resemblance to his original creation.)","30","434409"
"1920","The Happening is both too incoherenly weird and too narratively ambitious for its own good.","30","949731"
"1921","Mr. Emmerich, who has often conjured with cosmic themes, sometimes wittily, achieves something new this time around — a level of indifference to the genre and its fans that amounts to a cosmic shrug. What does it matter if the absurdity is slovenly, the whimsy leaden, the extravagance squalid?","30","2334879"
"1922","A slapdash, poorly acted, paint-by-numbers teen horror comedy, the sequel is too frenetically edited to build any suspense, and its special effects are strictly bargain basement.","30","118604"
"1923","The canniest moments in the three-plus hours of Nixon, Oliver Stone's dense, ultimately disappointing biopic, capture Nixon at his most pathetically endearing--the Commander in Chief as klutz.","30","113987"
"1924","Even die-hard Trekkies may be disappointed by Star Trek V. Coming after Leonard Nimoy's delightful directorial outing on Star Trek IV, William Shatner's inauspicious feature directing debut is a double letdown.","30","98382"
"1925","A lumbering, self-important three-hour melodrama that defies credibility at every turn.","30","120689"
"1926","Perhaps vice isn't what it used to be, or maybe Crockett and Tubbs just aren't all that interesting when removed from their appropriate time slot, but this may well be the dreariest and most monochromatic time you'll have at the movies all summer.","30","430357"
"1927","Lacks the sexy elan of ""La Femme Nikita"" and suffers from infinitely worse culture shock. [18 Nov 1994, p.C18]","30","110413"
"1928","It’s contrived at every turn and talky like a French film, though 100 percent American indie in its earnest conviction that it’s saying something of substance about the unpredictable roller coaster of life and love.","30","5989218"
"1929","What’s lost in comedy is not matched by a gain in emotional engagement.","30","6663582"
"1930","Ordinary moviegoers, on the other hand, may wonder what they're supposed to feel, apart from bored.","30","243133"
"1931","The best thing that can be said about this lethargic coming-of-age tale, noticeably undernourished at 78 minutes, is that it's better than the even more pathetic ""Stolen Summer.""","30","357470"
"1932","Cruise pedals hard through The Last Samurai, and the exertion shows. In fact, the whole picture is belabored and lumbering.","30","325710"
"1933","A mean-spirited little movie, investing its limited charms in all the wrong characters.","30","1196141"
"1934","The premise for this sci-fi actioner makes sense for about four seconds, after which you begin to wonder why everyone on the planet would willingly become a shut-in.","30","986263"
"1935","Less extraordinary and considerably more banal, given the sci-fi/comedy subject matter, is Men in Black 3's story, which jumps the ectomorphic shark in high style but with a deficit of actual belly laughs.","30","1409024"
"1936","The lesson here is simple: In the digital realm, the bigger the worse. What looks distinctive and believable in short takes and small doses can turn blatantly phony and deadly familiar when the scale is pumped up. Prince of Persia pumps itself up to the bursting point, and bursts.","30","473075"
"1937","There’s not much to say about Halloween III that hasn’t already been said about either of the other two Halloween pics or a slew of imitators.","30","85636"
"1938","Game ride that makes the two previous installments look like models of classic filmmaking.","30","163025"
"1939","Under the Skin falls in love with its bleak monotony. It is a melodrama with all the thrills surgically excised.","30","1441395"
"1940","It's so laden with foreboding, you want to get out from under it and gasp for air.","30","315733"
"1941","Labor Day is so self-conscious and phony, it must be the work of a pod person. Humans, film lovers, and fans of Reitman's till-now-flawless filmography: We've gotta fight back.","30","1967545"
"1942","Rated PG, which must stand for ""particularly gullible,"" it's ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" for people who slept through American history class.","30","368891"
"1943","Lost Highway, David Lynch's first movie in five years, is a virtuoso symphony of bad vibes.","30","116922"
"1944","For all its video-game bedazzlements, Attack of the Clones suffers from severe digital glut, periodically relieved, if you can call it that, by amateur theatrics.","30","121765"
"1945","Resisting the temptation to invest its characters and storytelling with any particularly winsome, distinctive qualities, the film quickly devolves into an infernally busy and overextended chase sequence crammed with desperately unfunny comic patter and noisy, pointless action.","30","2709768"
"1946","It's a damn shame when the dreaded third leg in the franchise feels like a pale imitation of an already pale imitator.","30","859163"
"1947","A good cast led by Miles Teller gets swallowed up in a narrative that grows progressively more muddled and tedious.","30","1502712"
"1948","Ironically, the stars didn't get it together either. The Blues Brothers offers the melancholy spectacle of them sinking deeper and deeper into a comic grave.","30","80455"
"1949","If it's all supposed to be in fun, why does it feel so much like an insult?","30","118715"
"1950","Crazy? Crazy is too mild a word by far to describe the twisted worm at play inside the skull of the Canadian director DavidCronenberg -- And that craziness is given full vent in the vomitorium called eXistenZ.","30","120907"
"1951","A violent cartoon that trivializes apartheid. If there's any justice, the birds of loneliness will be circling the box office.","30","105159"
"1952","The few good lines go to Kristofferson and the ever-amusing Kier, but Snipes's considerable energy is buried under an affectless, Terminator-style demeanor.","30","120611"
"1953","If you see it, the sequel will be your fault.","30","343818"
"1954","There's a clumsiness here, a succession of setups and awkward payoffs that are so on-the-nose, so cringe-inducingly earnest, that it's hard not to laugh. Even the story behind Grace's name is more likely to trigger guffaws than the kind of sentimental welling-up intended.","30","7985692"
"1955","This film lacks even the inadvertently buoyant awfulness that makes some bad movies fun. It's just plain dull.","30","83642"
"1956","Despite all the anguished huffing and puffing, there isn't a single authentic moment in it, and all you're left with in the end is the fading memory of two overscaled, Oscar-bait performances.","30","88683"
"1957","Time travels, but it sure doesn't fly by in this debacle.","30","300556"
"1958","Wolverine is a noisy mess, an origin/prequel that's nicely full of Jackman's ace glare as Wolverine and seriously killer snarl – The Boy From Aaarrrgh! – but utterly devoid of any of the borderline subversive smarts that made Bryan Singer's ""X-Men"" outings so contemporarily resonant.","30","458525"
"1959","It's an eroticism of nastiness -- triple-X fare for dirty old men in raincoats. If you resist this sleazy gorefest, you'll be right to feel proud of yourself.","30","106582"
"1960","And next time around... show the courage of your lowbrow convictions and get back to the gonzo, unapologetically senseless mayhem that made this saga so much fun in the beginning.","30","144964"
"1961","In crudest terms, there's no one to root for, and unlike Mamet or Pinter, for instance, the story isn't remotely strong enough to thrive without such a center… [The film s]trains hard to be smart and is ultimately repellent. [11 May 1992]","30","105151"
"1962","Bateman, as both director and star, digs his heels in too hard to make the movie's points, using lots of ho-hum close-ups and wriggly camera work along the way.","30","2170299"
"1963","What finally undoes the struggle to maintain suspense is Goyer's dialogue, which is consistently hokey.","30","1139668"
"1964","To attempt a critical evaluation of Orion's new Caddyshack is a little like describing the esthetic qualities of an outhouse.","30","80487"
"1965","SEVERAL of the characters in Dune are psychic, which puts them in the unique position of being able to understand what goes on in the movie.","30","87182"
"1966","The effects are just as delirious this time around, but the nightmare poetry has vanished, along with the sense of archetypal purpose and narrative inevitability that held the jack-in-the-box original together.","30","92991"
"1967","Director Howard is so mesmerized by the flames, he squirts formulaic lighter fluid over everything. A conflagration of hyped-up movie cliches, courtesy of George Lucas's Industrial Light & Magic special effects shop, scalds your face.","30","101393"
"1968","LaBute is some kind of find: an auteur for people who don't like movies.","30","171580"
"1969","So, to sum it up, Superman IV: The Quest For Peace is only slightly better than being trapped in a bear hug with Jan DeBont, and several steps below having an esoteric conversation with the Ghoulies.","30","94074"
"1970","What isn't so fascinating is this movie's absurdity of motivation. No one does anything that makes sense. No one seems real. When the actual perpetrator is uncovered, there is no enlightenment as to why the killing occurred.","30","103772"
"1971","The sort of thing that makes you wish you were playing a video game instead.","30","1188729"
"1972","The Bodyguard isn't a good movie, but it's often enjoyably bad, and that's no small achievement. So many talented people had a hand in it, starting with director Mick Jackson and screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan, that you stare at the screen in a state of rapt bewilderment. Just about everything that can go wrong with this film does, and yet it's compulsively watchable. (So is a train wreck.) [25 Nov 1992, p.F1]","30","103855"
"1973","McAvoy and Radcliffe are actors with charm to burn, but it’s only in brief moments that their characterizations cut through the film’s pandemonium, while the jokes they’re called upon to deliver land with a thud.","30","1976009"
"1974","A grim disappointment for grown-ups, and far too violent for young kids. I found it to be clumsy, misanthropic and intractably lifeless.","30","212720"
"1975","Would have proved the point if it weren't so mechanically scripted.","30","207201"
"1976","This is moviemaking for people who don't much like movies unless they are -- you know -- ""serious."" It is visually inert. It appears to be taking up small-scaled, yet emotionally resonant issues, but does not actually define them sharply or bring them to firm conclusions.","30","757361"
"1977","A film adaptation should, of course, treat its source material as inspiration rather than dogma. But did Burton have to get the books so ENTIRELY wrong?","30","1014759"
"1978","The screenplay just isn't funny: Most jokes fall flat and just lie there in a pool of their own sick. And while Zwigoff's deadpan pacing was perfect for the wry, sophisticated humor of ""Ghost World,"" here it's a comedy killer; that extra beat after each new outrage is just long enough for viewers to realize just how sad and disturbing it all is.","30","307987"
"1979","The Grudge plods on as if it were something more than formula gunk, cutting back and forth among the thinly written unfortunates who’ve been touched by the curse of that house.","30","3612126"
"1980","A flimsy premise to begin with, it’s been punctured beyond repair by an amateur script from Bill Kelly and director Hugh Wilson (The First Wives Club), and by Wilson’s shocking ineptitude with dialogue, framing and pace.","30","124298"
"1981","I wasn’t much scared by anything in Final Destination 2 which is silly and illogical.","30","309593"
"1982","My Girl may well have been intended as a tender way for parents to explain difficult subjects to their kids, but this botch of a movie explains nothing. Its fake nostalgia and cod compassion are as painfully awkward as adolescence itself and about as funny as a corpse.","30","102492"
"1983","I've observed this Seth Rogen comedy, and I can report that it's not very good.","30","1197628"
"1984","The surprise is that a picture made to be exciting for 136 minutes is so unexciting most of the time. It starts with a bang and keeps banging, so there's little suspense and no crescendo. [12 Aug 1991, p.28]","30","103064"
"1985","Once the terror ends and the credits roll, we finally get to the best part: a merciful escape.","30","204626"
"1986","Rarely has a film with such a great cast and so many moments of terrific writing and such high dramatic goals been so messy and disorganized and fundamentally bad.","30","466893"
"1987","More in the dumb and dumber tradition of ""Halloween"" and ""Friday the 13th"" sequels.","30","130018"
"1988","The first Lynch film in which his motives -- to hang a haberdashery of bizarre incidents on the merest hook of plot -- are apparent... What's lacking is the old sense of delicious, disturbing mystery. [20 Aug 1990, p.63]","30","100935"
"1989","Not many actors could do justice to the vanilla story presented by Grogan and screenwriters Scott Frank and Don Roos, but Wilson and Aniston – two of the blandest, most uninteresting actors working today – are just the actors to pull it off.","30","822832"
"1990","It's not a total wipeout: Czuchry embodies the Tucker Max(-ims) to a self-obsessed fault, and there are moments of rough comic brilliance scattered throughout, but really, this particular antihero is all anti- and zero hero.","30","1220628"
"1991","Malibu's screenplay inexplicably required the creative efforts of four screenwriters (including Kennedy), which works out to about half a funny gag apiece.","30","328099"
"1992","Heavy Metal is the bummer version of ""Star Wars,"" an expression of adolescent revenge against the world. What gives the movie its thoroughly unpleasant integrity is the suspicion it arouses that the guys who dreamed this stuff up mean business. If only they'd saved it for their shrinks. [10 Aug 1981, p.69]","30","82509"
"1993","I suspect the unconverted will want to be beamed up pronto.","30","92007"
"1994","Possibly one of the dullest takes on a real-life murder mystery, this gutter’s-eye-view of the waning days of Los Angeles porn king John ""Johnny Wadd"" Holmes is barely as interesting as one of the big man’s films, and a lot less revelatory.","30","335563"
"1995","Of the many comic book superhero movies, this is by far the lamest, the loudest, the longest. Good Lord, what an epic sit. My rear end deserves a medal...I wish I could say it wasn't so, but for most of us, this ""X"" marks a splat.","30","290334"
"1996","A dull, tired mess.","30","489235"
"1997","Dismally lurid stuff, ham-fistedly directed and low on credibility.","30","68408"
"1998","I'm usually a sucker for courtroom dramas, but Rob Reiner's highly mechanical filming by numbers of Aaron Sorkin's adaptation of his own cliched and fatuous Broadway play kept putting me to sleep.","30","104257"
"1999","The moody images and Michael Nyman's score aren't enough to salvage this banal 1997 science fiction story.","30","119177"
"2000","If you tune out the dialogue, which is packed with raunch that has neither rhyme nor story reason, there are passable moments. The interludes of Nick shifting gears as he tries to beat the clock on another pizza run are nicely managed and say something about a character whose talent behind the wheel is a kind of grace note.","30","1622547"
"2001","It’s built on such a void of insight and experience, such a void of character and relationships, that even the first level of the house of narrative cards can’t stand.","30","8772262"
"2002","There's the scene in which Jacques, the French Canadian proprietor of the Power and Glory, tells Laura, ""I am the Great Went,"" to which she responds, ""I am the muffin."" Jacques returns, ""I'm as blank as a fart."" Maybe all Jacques is saying is ""I am full of gas."" Certainly Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me seems to be.","30","105665"
"2003","What happened to the Kubrick who used to slip in sly, subtle jokes and little editing tricks? This may be his worst movie. He probably believes he's numbing us by the power of his vision, but he's actually numbing us by its emptiness. [13 July 1987, p.75]","30","93058"
"2004","As a big sci-fi entertainment, it hardly feels like a movie about the problems of two emotionally desperate people in a crazy situation, and therein lies the problem.","30","1355644"
"2005","Fouad Mikati's tawdry psychological thriller features the talented actress in a film that bears no small resemblance in theme, if not quality, to the hit movie version of Gillian Flynn's best-seller.","30","2948790"
"2006","Ostensibly about the banality of youthful evil, Kids is simply about its own banality. At best, it's a misplaced aesthetic experiment. At worst, it's glossy exploitation—with enough controversy to launch a thousand trite radio and television talk shows.","30","113540"
"2007","With a running time of 78 minutes, Awake is relatively painless, playing a little like a lesser story from one of EC Comics Shock SuspenStories – or a lot like Joseph Cotten's ""Breakdown"" episode of Alfred Hitchock Presents – updated for the Fangoria generation.","30","211933"
"2008","Rob Cohen, who last directed ""The Skulls"" --ouch! -- can consider this one another career-killing skid mark.","30","232500"
"2009","What's worse, some mysterious movie curse has turned the three once-lively adventurers into wood.","30","926084"
"2010","Ironically, the filmmakers don't seem to realize that their movie is even shallower and sillier than its targets.","30","157503"
"2011","Gives you the creeps, the giggles and the groans in almost equal measure.","30","492044"
"2012","Quite shameless in imitating its predecessors.","30","134847"
"2013","None of the principals is remotely likable--although Kingsley does appear to enjoy swanning around the great Southwest like a low-rent Anthony Hopkins.","30","324127"
"2014","An astonishingly awkward marriage of ancient Norse mythology and 21st-century nonsense, Thor, directed by Kenneth Branagh, works too hard at simply functioning to assert why it, or we, should bother.","30","800369"
"2015","The movie spreads bad vibes like a virus.","30","1625346"
"2016","The faux-doc foundation simply doesn’t work here.","30","2114461"
"2017","Duffy tamps down his best instincts -- occasional wry humor and the appealingly oddball supporting character (Willem Dafoe last time, a bug-eyed Clifton Collins Jr. here as the MacManus' admiring Latino cohort) -- and doubles up on his worst: homophobic gags, tedious '90s-era slo-mo shootouts and overwrought gangster tropes.","30","1300851"
"2018","This may be one of the most sluggish sports comedies ever made -- even the supposedly rousing final sequence feels belabored and chubby.","30","839980"
"2019","A leviathan bore, big, clunky and ponderously overplotted.","30","99810"
"2020","Crudely remaking the 1932 Universal original.","30","120616"
"2021","An astonishingly lazy and perfunctory effort that does little to realize his (Carrey) comic potential.","30","110475"
"2022","A godforsaken (possibly literally) mess.","30","448157"
"2023","You’ll find beatings, shootouts, car crashes, awkward analogies and a measure of buddy badinage in “Bright,” but true enchantment is in short supply.","30","5519340"
"2024","When the movie isn't hitting us over the head, it's spooning out the material to us like broth to an invalid, drop by flavorless drop. The excruciating pace mirrors the sluggishness of Morrison's sonorous prose.","30","120603"
"2025","The tenuous conclusion is that all this metaphysical hugger-mugger was divinely ordered to reconcile Costner and his father. All those dead players were summoned from that Great Locker Room in the Sky in a painfully false move. [9 May 1989, p.26]","30","97351"
"2026","The collapse of Office Space's second half is so egregious that one can't help but suspect Judge's Achilles heel may be his writing. It's not that he can't write -- it's just that his ideas tend to shine better within a pool of fellow scribes, as proven in his television career.","30","151804"
"2027","The film, which opens today at the Sutton and other theaters, is composed of a prologue, written for the movie, plus four separate stories, each of them either based directly on a script from the television series or suggested by one. A lot of money and several lives might have been saved if the producers had just rereleased the original programs.","30","86491"
"2028","The Coens have deliberately cut themselves off from their best subject. Try as they will to create a vision of corporate (and urban) hellishness through sheer stylishness, theirs is a truly abstract expressionism, at once heavy, lifeless and dry.","30","110074"
"2029","The jokes are relentlessly crass and objectionable; the song'n'dance routines have been created in the cutting-room and have lost any sense of fun; Fellini-esque moments add little but pretension; and scenes of a real open-heart operation, alternating with footage of a symbolic Angel of Death in veil and white gloves, fail even in terms of the surreal.","30","78754"
"2030","The wallpaper emotes more than Ryan Gosling does in Only God Forgives, an exercise in supreme style and minimal substance.","30","1602613"
"2031","The Nines is the feature-film-directing debut from screenwriter John August (Go, Big Fish), but it feels much more like some Bizarro World collaboration between Jean-Paul Sartre and Charlie Kaufman, and not in a good way, either.","30","810988"
"2032","It's a classic fantasy scenario, overflowing with creative possibilities, but Carrey's Nolan isn't charmingly misguided or comically loathsome enough to deserve the lesson; he's just a big, inconsequential crybaby.","30","315327"
"2033","Even generally sympathetic adults may eventually find their minds wandering, if only because of the characters' continual, annoying hopping; being vegetables, they have no legs, you see.","30","298388"
"2034","It is about as diverting as having a porcelain sink broken over your head.","30","2975590"
"2035","The most sterile of bodice-rippers, a genteel soap opera in which the sex and intrigue are so muted, so tasteful, that they practically blow off the screen in a scattering of dust.","30","467200"
"2036","In lieu of tension, the film is stuffed with crazed musical crescendos, amateurish structural feints and pregnant pauses that cry out for the familiar “chu-CHUNG” of a “Law & Order” scene change.","30","2304953"
"2037","I didn't mind the preposterousness of the premise nearly so much as the general ineptness with which it's presented. After all, good trash has its place. [8 Dec 1994, p.A16]","30","109635"
"2038","Part comedy, part family drama, part romance, part special-effects mystery-adventure, and not entirely satisfying on any of these levels, this hodgepodge suffers from the conflicting sensibilities of its three credited scripters: Robin Swicord, who has done good work before, Akiva Goldsman, who has not, and Adam Brooks.","30","120791"
"2039","Rodrigo Cortes keeps the action bound to the box, limiting his lighting to naturalistic approximations, so that much of Reynolds's performance consists of him grunting and heaving in the dark.","30","1462758"

"2044","This means that for one ticket price, you get three shoddy Friday the 13th movies packed into one, which might constitute entertainment value if any one of them constituted entertainment.","30","758746"
"2045","The movie's chief crime against the planet, other than the sheer wastage of time, is the trivializing of the great Freeman. This actor has such dignity and depth and humanity, he almost makes the film watchable.","30","120696"
"2046","It's an utter waste of Watts; there's not a trace here of the talent on display in Mulholland Drive, perhaps because the script doesn't bother to give her a character.","30","298130"
"2047","The Iron Lady is, to put it kindly, a shambles.","30","1007029"
"2048","But by the time Willis's character saves this considerably long day, it's filmgoers who will no doubt feel like prisoners, as a movie that promises to be a taut nail-biter devolves into the kind of silly, overblown climax parodied so beautifully by Robert Altman in ""The Player.""","30","340163"
"2049","Two things come to mind as you watch the first act of Street Kings, the first is how fresh and exciting the movie would’ve been if it was released in 1984, the second is the question, “James Ellroy wrote that?”","30","421073"
"2050","Olympus Has Fallen is a disgusting piece of work, but it certainly hits its marks — it makes you sick with suspense.","30","2302755"

"2052","In a role hardly larger than a cameo despite the fact that he's ostensibly the male romantic lead, Segel never tries to hide that he's only here to pay his mortgage - which makes him the most likeable presence on-screen","30","1284575"
"2053","Jennifer Lopez's butt? Alas, the moment is over all too soon; the movie, sadly, is not.","30","209958"
"2054","The film is alive with bad rock bands and dizzying bit parts, the standout being Kieran Culkin, in the role of Scott's gay roommate, but we feel them gyrating around a hollow core.","30","446029"
"2055","It's an uninspired blend, integrating the boys from ""Porky's"" and the girls from ""Foxes"" into a vehicle resembling the worst of ""American Graffiti"" and the best of ""Rock and Roll High School."" [13 Aug 1982]","30","83929"
"2056","In its eagerness to drag us through the lower depths of human experience, Precious leaves no space for the audience to breathe or to draw our own conclusions. For a film about empowerment and self-actualization, it wields an awfully large cudgel.","30","929632"
"2057","The project would have been much more palatable as a TV special; as it stands, it's just another symptom of the American cinema's addiction to facile mythmaking.","30","87957"
"2058","Lone Survivor just reads like a quasi-political exaggeration of a slasher film: the cellphones that don't work, the rescuers just out of reach, the killers chasing our victims through the woods.","30","1091191"
"2059","Even though Carrey is a bit mellower these days, the schtick feels dated. He's doing material from the '90s.","30","1068680"

"2061","When the story finally collapses in a heap at the end, you'll probably want your money back, but that's where the title comes in: ""Next!""","30","435705"
"2062","Despite the sophistication of the source material, this 1984 film isn't particularly successful: Petersen insists on forcing the superficial moral lessons, and the half hour removed from the film by its American distributors leaves it with a harsh, choppy rhythm.","30","88323"
"2063","The story -- is just what fills in the gaps between slow-motion fireballs, Matrix-style frozen mayhem, and Halle Berry's notoriously undraped breasts.","30","244244"
"2064","Sayles speaks the language of cinematic formula so automatically -- his reunited lovers slow dance to a jukebox in a dark, deserted cafe and wait unannounced outside each other's workplaces when they want to talk -- that he's forgotten that real people don't do this stuff.","30","116905"
"2065","Gary Dauberman’s haphazard screenplay merely piles on the cheap scares, with director Leonetti cranking the volume up to 11 to accentuate the frequent jolts. It all adds up to a compendium of horror movie clichés.","30","3322940"
"2066","Ploddingly paced (it runs nearly 20 minutes longer than the 1977 film, to detrimental effect), poorly scripted and featuring largely amateurish performances and cheesy special effects, this Rabid strives to emulate the striking body horror of the original but mainly comes across like a half-baked imitation.","30","5628902"
"2067","Computer technology may be the actual phantom menace, after all.","30","120915"
"2068","When the head-scratching impossibilities are more irritating than intriguing, does the last-second explanation outweigh the two hours we've spent rolling our eyes?","30","2343793"
"2069","In the end you have to wonder why the highly reputed director Michael Apted (""Coal Miner's Daughter"") and the gifted screenwriter Nicholas Kazan (""Reversal of Fortune"") chose to go slumming in territory like this. They must have been offered wads of money to do the dirty job.","30","278435"
"2070","Michael Caton-Jones' pompous and coarsely stupid inflation of what remains a superior thriller, Fred Zinnemann's The Day of the Jackal (1973).","30","119395"
"2071","The movie is very loud. It is pointlessly loud, arbitrarily loud, assaultively loud.","30","119081"
"2072","Director Paul W.S. Anderson (who also directed the original) can hardly manage a hint of suspense or excitement. And excitement is exactly what the film ought to have in excess.","30","1220634"
"2073","As written and directed by newcomer Troy Duffy, The Boondock Saints is all style and no substance, a film so gleeful in its endorsement of vigilante justice that it almost veers (or ascends) into self-parody.","30","144117"
"2074","For much of the movie, the kinetic furor of the game sequences helps camouflage the weaknesses of a screenplay that is a mechanically contrived series of power struggles.","30","146838"
"2075","He is meant to be brooding, I think, but Tatum’s vague features read more “meathead” than anguished young lover. He has to carry the film, but he’s the least interesting thing going on here.","30","989757"
"2076","While its audacity is laudable, the film ultimately has all the thrill of watching someone else play a first-person-shooter video game.","30","3072482"
"2077","Instead of gold-medal-winning, last-minute heroics, the movie weirdly becomes about the scandal of arbitrary gymnastics judges. Is it a movie or an episode of ""Real Sports""? It veers into fresh territory but not dramatically satisfying territory.","30","430634"
"2078","They are also bloody and sadistic. There are two basic gore effects: In one, heavy chains fly through the air to impale people with sharp hooks, which then separate those people from their skin, or worse. Elsewhere, flesh crawls and melds with nearby flesh. There are also close-ups of various bloody, flesh-dripping tools and assorted maggots. All this is decidedly gross but not particularly frightening. [9 March 1996, p.H03]","30","116514"
"2079","In addition to all else, and it's a lot, The Losers wastes the riches of Hollywood technology in hot pursuit of nothing.","30","480255"
"2080","Two ridiculous blood-soaked hours.","30","146675"
"2081","James Jones's antiwar novel was blandly realized by the usual bunch of Hollywood do-gooders in 1953...Sominex is cheaper and probably safer.","30","45793"
"2082","He hardly bothers with the characters; the movie is a ventriloquial harrangue. He thrashes around in messianic God-love booziness, driving each scene to an emotional peak.","30","74958"
"2083","There's absolutely nothing to it, beyond Ms Beals cavorting in a leotard, lots of sheeny backgrounds courtesy of Lyne the former adman, and a Joe Eszterhas screenplay mixed through with cliché concentrate as female blue-collar worker proceeds from showgirl at a men's club to the big audition for the Pittsburgh ballet school. The star, it has to be said, is not at her most convincing as a welder (how does she afford an apartment the size of an aircraft hangar?), nor should we forget that most of the serious terpsichorean gymnastics were done by uncredited French dancer Marine Jahan.","30","85549"
"2084","This is basically sloppy, all-over-the-map filmmaking with few hints of self-criticism and few genuine laughs.","30","215545"
"2085","An overgrown hybrid of disaster epic, can-do combat adventure and '50s sci-fi movie, this craft has visited our world many times before. And while she's a beaut, the sticker on her titanium bumper reads: ""Been There, Done That, Beam Me Up, Scotty.""","30","116629"
"2086","What possessed Liv Tyler to take a role in this sadistic, unmotivated home-invasion flick.","30","482606"
"2087","Written and directed by Walter Hill, who once wrote and directed a good movie, Hard Times, with Charles Bronson. This one is not good. It is Awful Movie. It is Pretentious Movie. It is Silly Movie. It talks just like this.","30","77474"
"2088","If you admired Bette Midler in The Rose and Down and Out in Beverly Hills, you may want to bash you head against the wall...The director, Garry Marshall, shows no feeling for the material - not even false feeling.","30","94715"
"2089","It's not the worst film in the series -- ""Halloween III"" will never be unseated -- but there's not nearly enough scares, or humor, to make Halloween: Resurrection worthwhile.","30","220506"
"2090","If you consider what the exalted quartet of Branagh, Pinter, Caine and Law might have done with the project, and what they did to it, Sleuth has to be the worst prestige movie of the year.","30","857265"
"2091","Awash in hackneyed old-time secrets and hydrophobic metaphor, never consumes us as it should.","30","120824"
"2092","With the exception of Carrie and The Shining, the novels of Stephen King have not made the transition to film particularly well, so it should be little surprise that Pet Sematary is another DOA -- Dog on Arrival.","30","98084"
"2093","Kin never feels like more than uninspired borrowings from other, better genre films; it’s a story about family without any heart.","30","6017942"
"2094","Not clever or polished enough to be successful as farce, unwilling to supply any reason to care about any of its characters, unable to make the points about the role of fashion in society it thinks it is, ""Ready to Wear"" is madness without the usual Altman method.","30","110907"
"2095","Overblown melodrama, as muddle-headed as it is palpably sincere.","30","361127"
"2096","Despite a few lighter touches, the film is still a gory waste of time that plays its murders for all the blood and guts they're worth. There are plenty of cliched reaction shots of faces in terror, more than enough frames filled with bloody knives and severed heads. There is not, however, any suspense about Jason or his victims. He stalks, they scream, he kills. None of it is enough to make you jump out of your seat, though it may be enough to make your stomach churn. [2 Aug 1986, p.9]","30","91080"
"2097","You want to know if The Running Man is a good-time macho show, right? Stay at home and watch professional wrestling. Or Miami Vice (same director -- Paul Michael Glaser). Sure there's blood spattering and bullets riddling and Big Boys Banging Biceps. But through the dry-ice haze, Running Man is surprisingly boring.","30","93894"
"2098","To introduce an archetype like this to western audiences -- as the world weathers culturally and religiously demonizing times -- may have been worth this whole flawed movie. Too bad the story didn't just start with him.","30","320661"
"2099","Delectably vulgar for 20 minutes or so, almost too bad to be true, but because it lacks the demented conviction of real camp, the glint of madness that keeps a bauble like ""Valley of the Dolls"" afloat, it soon loses its cheap-thrills appeal.","30","425253"
"2100","The body-swapping premise, which is stale to begin with, isn't explored with any depth, unless you find meaningful Freudian subtext in the movie's relentless anal fixation. But the premise at least sets up a farce that surpasses ""The Hangover"" in gleeful crudeness and profanity.","30","1488555"
"2101","Made me feel like a Christmas goose being fattened for slaughter. Its force-fed diet of whimsy cloyed long before the eagerly anticipated romantic payoff arrived to put me out of my misery.","30","128853"
"2102","Stuck in that no man's land between comedy and banal movie mob action, and it delivers on neither of these impulses with any force.","30","289848"
"2103","Diesel himself has the personality of a golem and a knack for dialogue delivery that suggests recent oral surgery.","30","295701"
"2104","It's sad when a bit of grim futuristic silliness like Repo Men falls short on all counts, down to the most basic level of entertainment value.","30","1053424"
"2105","""The only thing that matters is the ending,"" Mort declares in the closing seconds, just as the director is serving up a colossal (and literally corny) stinker. But for Depp, it's yet another daunting mission accomplished with wit and ingenuity.","30","363988"
"2106","It's a campy, juiced-up ker-splat, busy with clumsy pyrotechnics and never nearing the vicinity of satire.","30","133152"
"2107","It’s a comedy that seems perpetually in search of laughs it almost never finds, as if the filmmakers showed up on the first day of production, looked at the script, and realized they’d forgotten to write any jokes, and then had to scramble to find some on set.","30","2702724"
"2108","Emmerich’s main achievement is to take a bunch of excellent actors, including Danny Glover, Thandie Newton, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Woody Harrelson, and to prevent all of them--with the exception of Oliver Platt and a pair of giraffes--from giving a decent performance.","30","1190080"
"2109","This big-budget bore looks lovely but is so miscalculated that you can't help but wonder whether anyone involved had ever seen the original.","30","118661"
"2110","Oblivion never transcends its inspirations to become anything other than a thin copy.","30","1483013"

"2112","Proves that the Disney people can sell just about anything--including a misogynistic celebration of big business and prostitution.","30","100405"

"2114","Terminally boring.","30","101917"
"2115","Coppola decided that he really wasn't making a horror film after all, but rather a love story, a comic burlesque, a costume drama, a piece of erotica, whatever. But no matter what else you do with it, a Dracula that cannot manage to be more scary than silly is as pitilessly doomed as that elegant old Transylvanian himself. [13 Nov 1992]","30","103874"
"2116","Peaks early with a vertiginous dogfight; thereafter, spotty CGI and a bamboozling plot conspire toward a colossal anticlimax.","30","253556"
"2117","Fans of the book will despise it, others will just find it tries too hard. If you want to see the masters of the universe chastened, see ""Wall Street."" This is a story of redeemed white guys.","30","99165"
"2118","All of the nonsense piled on nonsense does provide some measure of pleasure. Unknown gets better by getting worse.","30","1401152"
"2119","There are gaping holes in logic throughout this sloppy, cheap-looking mess from ""Disturbia"" director D.J. Caruso.","30","1464540"
"2120","First-time feature filmmaker Dave Wilson and cinematographer Jacques Jouffret (“Mile 22”) can manipulate the speed of combat scenes all he wants (the stylistic crutch of a slo-mo point of contact is evergreen) but dull choreography, CGI overuse and Cuisinart editing are still the bane of today’s action sequences.","30","1634106"
"2121","No Strings Attached is so palpably calculated that you know if the camera had pulled back a foot from the bed in which Portman and Kutcher were pretending to have sex, you'd have seen their agents standing by beaming: proud parents, proud pimps.","30","1411238"
"2122","It’s so derivative that it isn’t a thriller—it’s a crude, ghoulish comedy on thriller themes. The director, Joel Coen, who wrote the screenplay with his brother Ethan, who was the producer, is inventive and amusing when it comes to highly composed camera setups or burying someone alive. But he doesn’t seem to know what to do with the actors; they give their words too much deliberation and weight, and they always look primed for the camera. So they come across as amateurs.","30","86979"
"2123","Arthur overextends its welcome and relies too much on prop comedy.","30","1334512"
"2124","If Napoleon Dynamite really is, as reported, a semiautobiographical exercise, it is one of the most astoundingly self-hating such exercises in memory.","30","374900"
"2125","The co-directing brothers Goetz prove adept at building escape-the-bad-guy action sequences, but they continually run up against the story's Marquis-de-Sade underpinnings.","30","1663655"
"2126","It takes at least a sliver of human interest to make a noir pastiche more than the sum of its influences, and anything resembling authentic feeling has been neatly airbrushed away from this movie’s synthetic surface.","30","458481"
"2127","A vicious anti-Catholic diatribe disguised as an audition tape for MTV.","30","145531"
"2128","It’s a chaotic jumble of movie references, cellphone footage, emojis, trigger warnings and edgy teen content. But it’s the fumbled “feminist” commentary that is just embarrassing to watch.","30","6205872"
"2129","A stiff drink or maybe some pharmaceutical assistance might have made me overlook the film's sour tone, or the unremarkableness of its direction.","30","396269"
"2130","This graphically violent film suffers from cursorily developed characters whose primary function is to advance the creaky plot.","30","804461"
"2131","Ninety minutes of Shock Treatment feels like a week in ""Mister Rogers' Neighborhood,"" a Quaalude interlude, a quart of Sanka laced with Valium. No jolt...Despite flashy lights, splashy sets and plump girls in tight white corsets, ""S.T.'s"" a bore -- a blatant try for teeny-punk bucks. It's a lesson for filmmakers: You can't force a cult film, they just happen. [28 May 1982, p.13]","30","83067"
"2132","The clammy eccentricity on display -- is like a wet blanket, while Colin Friesen's lazy screenplay has all the wit of a slushball. ""March of the Penguins"" was funnier and edgier.","30","402850"
"2133","As Frank Galvin, the misbegotten inspirational hero of Sidney Lumet's imbecilic courtroom melodrama The Verdict, Paul Newman takes sanctimonious satisfaction in impersonating the sorriest excuse for a crusading attorney since Anne Bancroft misrepresented Margaux Hemingway in ""Lipstick.""

"2134","The 20th-anniversary sequel to the groundbreaking horror film-and the sixth in an increasingly awful series about the bulletproof murderer Michael Myers-is a styleless and predictable affair.","30","120694"

"2137","Doesn't progress or deepen, it just gets weirder, and to no good end.","30","90756"
"2138","Okja takes the worst impulses of Walt Disney, Wes Anderson, Tim Burton and Michael Moore and rolls them into one movie.","30","3967856"
"2139","Quite an achievement: the American director Todd Haynes revisits the world of London glam rock and manages to make it look dull.","30","120879"
"2140","The general insensitivity of the atmosphere gets one down after a while. None of these people go together: Friends don't seem like friends, lovers don't seem like lovers. In brief, it's not enough just to have bad taste. You have to have talent, too.","30","129387"
"2141","Let's start with the obvious: Olyphant just isn't that intimidating an assassin. Think of some of cinema's more memorable button men: Léon, Luca Brasi, Frank Nitti...that's right, not a pretty boy in the bunch.","30","465494"
"2142","After the first five minutes of the Music Hall's new show - we needed those five to orient ourselves - we were content to play the game called ""the cliche expert goes to the movies"" and we are not at all proud to report that we scored 100 per cent against Dudley Nichols, Hagar Wilde and Howard Hawks, who wrote and produced the quiz. Of course, if you've never been to the movies, Bringing Up Baby will be all new to you - a zany-idden product of the goofy farce school. But who hasn't been to the movies?","30","29947"
"2143","Secretariat stumbles along beneath the weight of leaden life lessons. They're dispensed at frequent intervals by Diane Lane, who does better than anyone had a right to expect, since she is saddled with dialogue of exceptional dreadfulness.","30","1028576"

"2146","The Wachowski brothers have rendered their chronicles into banality, as if trying to imitate the qualitative tailspin of the ""Star Wars"" series.","30","242653"
"2147","Writer-director Abe Sylvia slathers on the cartoonish characterization and neon-colored '80s pop - Benatar! Joan Jett! The Outfield! - for an easy-bake mood-setting, which is tedious enough. But his attempts at situational humor on the road - including a stripping scene for Dozier as coming-out metaphor - fall embarrassingly flat.","30","1107319"
"2148","Dawn pummels the viewer with a series of ever-more-grisly events - decapitations, shootings, knifings, flesh tearings - that make Romero's special effects man, Tom Savini, the real 'star' of the film - the actors are as woodenly uninteresting as the characters they play. Romero's script is banal when not incoherent - those who haven't seen Night of the Living Dead may have some difficulty deciphering exactly what's going on at the outset of Dawn.","30","77402"

"2151","Producer-for-Life George Lucas puts his awesome creative machinery to work in Willow, a would-be adventure of little people, big people, good guys and bad. But the fantasy wheels grind to a halt, bogged down in Lucas' flat, derivative story, and not helped in the least by director Ron Howard's clumsy steering.","30","96446"
"2152","The overall mood created by the crummy, pinched visuals and logic-strained rhythm is of something scanned and discarded, like a tabloid article or a Lifetime movie.","30","3631112"

"2154","Appallingly violent.","30","187738"
"2155","The grad student and her boyfriend (Marc Blucas) are blandly written and the story never develops any psychological depth; the paranormal explanation for what's going on is equally slight.","30","283632"
"2156","(It doesn't hurt that Ms. Redgrave gets to play opposite Franco Nero, who was once the love of her life and is the father of her son.) Not even she can transform lines like ""Destiny wanted us to meet again.""","30","892318"

"2158","Not only are none of these characters particularly fun to be with, but the inevitable violence that enters their lives is strong and unpleasant. [03 Sep 1993]","30","107302"
"2159","This ersatz portrait of American big-top tent impresario P.T. Barnum is all smoke and mirrors, no substance. It hammers pedestrian themes of family, friendship and inclusivity while neglecting the fundaments of character and story.","30","1485796"
"2160","The ultimate cliché of plot-twist implausibility, the crucial revelation is so outlandishly fatuous it might have given Donald Kaufman pause.","30","309698"
"2161","Any message about the need for open-mindedness in life and love, however, is muddled by a slapdash plot that ultimately cares less about taking a stand in favor of progressive values than it does in superficially employing such feel-good ideas for unimaginative, hyperactive adolescent slapstick.","30","2510894"

"2164","While not entirely successful, at least deserves points for creativity.","30","229260"
"2165","An accidental entertainment, Equilibrium is a science-fiction pastiche so lacking in originality that if you stripped away its inspirations there would be precious little left.","30","238380"
"2166","Connery didn't want to play Bond anymore, and it shows in this forgettable picture. From a stirred, not shaken, martini to the ninja training school to the ""surgery"" to make Bond Japanese (by shaving his chest hair), there's nary a moment of this film that doesn't make any viewer cringe.","30","62512"
"2167","I'm genuinely of two minds about the picture. I want to say it's subtle, but I also want to say it's heavy-handed. I want to say it's incisive, but I have too many problems with its psychological elisions to let it off the hook.","30","120646"
"2168","The picture's attempt to satisfy the aggressive fantasies of a graying white-male audience is weirdly fascinating. It's something you don't see every day: a geriatric comic book.","30","118571"

"2170","In this bizarrely discordant mixture of ultraviolent action footage, bad acting, crisp special effects and futuristic camp, the remnants of Heinlein's rhetoric of military pride stick out like a grimy Marine uniform at a high-toned Hollywood party.","30","120201"
"2171","We should not be surprised, then, if this bellowing beast of a movie looks and sounds like the extended special-edition remix of a Duran Duran video.","30","293508"

"2173","No one would mistake the Benzini Bros. Circus for the greatest show on earth – the Depression-era traveling troupe is a junker compared to the gold-standard Ringling Bros. – but still, a film has to try pretty hard to render lions and tigers and trapeze artists so uniformly underwhelming.","30","1067583"
"2174","Not a movie, just one gigantic commercial for Hasbro.","30","418279"
"2175","Pop has always drawn energy from the lower floors of respectability; this movie, in which fan-boy cultism reaches new levels of goofy chaos and sexual confusion, draws energy from the subbasement.","30","416449"

"2181","The film is a burdensome two hours.","30","968264"
"2182","Irish director David Caffrey and English screenwriter Jeremy Drysdale have, respectively, zero sense of pace and a tin-eared grasp of period speech, and together fail either to let us care about their characters or to create any sense of a living era.","30","338075"
"2183","Abysmal thriller.","30","289879"
"2184","It's hard to tell if this thing's serious or parody and, if it is parody, whether or not it's intentional. Is it a winky joke, for instance, to have lightweight performer George Hamilton as Pacino's business attorney, or just ridiculous casting? Hamilton's performance points to the latter.","30","99674"

"2187","The key to Seuss' tales, as with all good fables, is not only their cleverness but their surpassing elegance and simplicity, qualities that this busy, over-cluttered contraption of a movie seems entirely uninterested in replicating.","30","1482459"
"2188","Chill to the core, Haneke presents human cruelty not to make us empathize with the victims or understand the oppressors but to rub our noses in the crimes of our species. He thinks he’s held on to the subversive ideals of punk, but all I smell is skunk.","30","1149362"
"2189","Like a half-remembered dream, the movie's often so overwhelming that even its dull, dead moments (of which there are many, unfortunately) leave you wondering what you're missing and what you've just forgotten.","30","166276"

"2191","The best things in the production are the garishly absurd sets. The costumes, including the gold lame athletic supporters worn by the members of Ming's palace guard, suggest an adolescent's fever dream. The pacing is so funereal that this Flash Gordon seems far longer and far less funny that the 15-chapter serial, Flash Gordon's Trip to Mars (1938), which starred Buster Crabbe.

"2196","The only reason to see it is Riz Ahmed's performance as Omar, the supposed brains of the operation. Mr. Ahmed reminded me a bit of Robert Carlyle. He's dynamic, quick-tongued and intense. And much too classy for this tatty room.","30","1341167"
"2197","Swaddled in the posh vulgarity that passes for awards-season elegance, Memoirs is deluxe orientalist kitsch, a would-be cross between ""Showgirls"" and ""Raise the Red Lantern,"" too dumb to cause offense though falling short of the oblivious abandon that could have vaulted it into high camp.","30","397535"
"2198","Roll past this casino.","30","112641"
"2199","There’s more flab than muscle packed on this galumphing franchise reboot, which, as it lumbers from scene to scene, reminds you of what a great action god Steven Spielberg is. Too bad he didn’t take the reins on this.","30","369610"
"2200","This 1979 movie adaptation of the cult TV series is blandness raised to an epic scale. Robert Wise's bloodless direction drains all the air from the Enterprise.","30","79945"
"2201","At the last, we're left with a film that tries to doll up a conventional genre with hints of depth, hoping to disguise the cross-dressing by putting it in the shape of an epic. Murnau, Mizoguchi, Ford, even you authors of the Book of Genesis, rest easy. [12 Oct 1992]","30","105695"
"2202","Unfortunately, director Richard Donner doesn't pay much attention to text, subtext, or anything else; his 1986 film is empty glitz in search of a style, with arbitrary action substituting for ordinary narrative coherence.","30","93409"
"2203","As creator and head writer of ""The West Wing,"" Aaron Sorkin had a gift for making policy debate seem sexy, but what worked in the context of that liberal fantasy founders badly amid the realpolitik of this cold war drama.","30","472062"
"2204","Overdresses and ultimately abandons what drew us to its 1998 predecessor in the first place: an intimate embrace with history.","30","414055"
"2205","Between bad hair and tonal irregularity, the movie doesn't give you much to like.","30","188453"
"2206","Ms. Weisz is always a strong presence, but her talents are wasted here on a naive heroine - the fictional Kathy is exceedingly slow to grasp the extent of the corruption - and a narrative style that turns the horror of the prostitutes' plight into harrowing melodrama.","30","896872"
"2207","If you like ""Maxim,"" you will love The Island. It is glossy. It is expensive. It has lots of slick ads for Aquafina and Cadillac.","30","399201"
"2208","The movie is shot as if Bigelow wanted to take her audience to the very edge of sensory overload. Her pulsing, super-psychedelic images are edgy and invasive. They burn as they hit your retina. After a while, however, Bigelow's careening camera, the heavy-metal music and the flash cutting begin to make you feel hammered and abused. Though the movie is jammed with plot, nothing seems to happen. [13 Oct 1995, p.F01]","30","114558"

"2218","THERE'S Big Trouble in Little China all right, as Kurt Russell wrestles his way through this kung-fu comedy adventure. It might have been a Raiders of the Lost Wok, but instead it's a bad marriage of martial arts and action spoofery, bungled by director John Carpenter working from the world's worst screenplay.

"2219","The new film stars The Rock, but The Wood might be a better description of his performance.","30","351977"
"2220","Writer Kevin Williamson, who's also responsible for the overrated ""Scream,"" sets cleverness above emotional impact in a poorly conceived 1997 thriller with plenty of empty references.","30","119345"
"2221","Offering no hint of the backbreaking drudgery and mental strain of their predicament, this gauzy picture (produced by the couple’s son, Jonathan Cavendish, and directed by his friend, the actor Andy Serkis) is a closed loop of rose-tinted memories.","30","5716464"

"2235","Does boast, as a major plot point, a dog's bowel movement. And things do go 'boom!' quite spectacularly and frequently enough to distract from the truth that there is virtually nothing going on in this whole movie that Nintendo hasn't done better.","30","187078"
"2236","Nichols must have a cummerbund around his head: the directing is constricted – there's no visual inventiveness or spontaneity. And in his hands the script has no conviction. [9 Jan 1989]","30","96463"
"2237","As reformulated by the aggressively mediocre director Raja Gosnell and screenwriter James Gunn, this Scooby-Doo is entertainment more disposable than Hanna-Barbera's half-hour cartoons ever were.","30","267913"
"2238","In the spirit of that world, I cannot tell a lie: The Invention of Lying, which the English comedian both directed and wrote with Matthew Robinson, soon loses altitude and eventually falls flat.","30","1058017"
"2239","A blandly twisting plot with no meaningful revelations or substantial themes.","30","139654"
"2240","The new facetious depressant from Colin Higgins -- the screenwriter and now director who has parlayed ""Harold and Maude,"" ""The Silver Streak"" and ""Foul Play"" into one of the more baffling winning streaks on record -- runs a merely weak comic premise into the ground with coarse, laborious execution. [19 Dec 1980, p.E1]","30","80319"
"2241","It seems as if it was made by people who have never actually watched an episode of Star Trek. So all the old poke-fun-at-Trekkies cliches are here.","30","177789"
"2242","DeLillo felt he needed a plot, and he invented one that is shockingly bad for a novelist of his accomplishment. It isn't the use of a plot that degrades the picture: it is the degrading plot itself--which isn't even a good cartoon of a too-busy plot.","30","425055"

"2248","Straining to put his own stamp on this stale-from-the-crypt material, Zombie falls back on the twitchy visual grammar of his videos, splicing in dream sequences and grainy porno-snippets apparently purchased at Bob Crane's estate sale. The violence eventually becomes more inhuman than human.","30","251736"
"2249","In a time of darkness, under the evil reign of John Malkovich -- who sits upon a throne in a different sound stage from the rest of the cast -- a hero shall rise. But lo, there will be little rejoicing, for this dragon rider (newcomer Edward Speleers) is but a nancy boy, about as imposing as Lance Bass, and somehow in possession of the only soap and clean clothes in all the land.","30","449010"
"2250","Fascinating in the way only a wrongheaded film by a great filmmaker can be, Legend lends beauty to such imagery, but the story keeps dragging it back to the mystical land of kitsch.","30","89469"
"2251","Dramatically and philosophically void and unprovocative on the grand scale of apocalyptic speculative fiction, this low-budget indie is somber and dreary on a moment-to-moment basis and leaves its talented cast stranded with few opportunities to alleviate the sense of stasis.","30","6169694"
"2252","Either the Coens failed, or I didn't figure out what they're attempting. I must be like Harry or Osborne, pretending to a sophistication I lack. Burn After Reading is a movie about stupidity that left me feeling stupid.","30","887883"
"2253","Stanley Kubrick's production of The Shining, a ponderous, lackluster distillation of Stephen King's best-selling novel, looms as the Big Letdown of the new film season. I can't recall a more elaborately ineffective scare movie. You might say that The Shining, opening today at area theaters, has no peers: Few directors achieve the treacherous luxury of spending five years (and $12 million-$15 million) on such a peerlessly wrongheaded finished product.","30","81505"
"2254","Poops out before it ever really gets going.","30","218817"
"2255","Beyond the dazzling ""first contact"" sequences seen in the trailers, Skyline is a spasmodic and incoherent shambles hampered by an astoundingly stupid screenplay.","30","1564585"
"2256","Despite a certain grace in the dialogue and casual plot construction, this is positively reeking of a desire to be cheerful in the face of adversity.","30","114478"
"2257","A dull, routine action-adventure in which the suspense is mechanical at best. Although there are a couple of gory moments, those expecting the jolts director Sean Cunningham brought to the original ""Friday the 13th"" are sure to be disappointed.","30","97179"
"2258","It would be destined for the trash heap of Shakespeare adaptations, if not for its female lead, and its heart, 17-year-old Claire Danes.","30","117509"
"2259","As messy and flat-footed as its predecessor is nimble and shapely. It's an ugly, bloated, repetitive movie that builds to a punch line that should have come an hour earlier (at least).","30","234215"

"2262","This extremely plot-thickened tale finally offers little more than the usual genre elements pushed to the kind of extremes that recall the acrid ""The Way of the Gun.""","30","235737"
"2263","It's worth recalling here that Carpenter made two of the better horror films of the modern era (Halloween and the vastly underrated The Thing), but career-nadir Body Bags is best zipped up quickly and abandoned along the comeback road. [07 Aug 1993, p.F16]","30","106449"
"2264","A movie that keeps jumping the gate and finally unravels all over the floor.","30","134273"
"2265","This is an impersonal and rather junky piece of moviemaking. It's packed with torture scenes, and it bangs away at you. And every time there's a possibility of a dramatic climax - a chance to engage the audience emotionally with something awesome - the director Richard Marquand trashes it.","30","86190"
"2266","It pretends to examine how self-absorbed we are as a culture, only to be consumed by its own self-absorption. It's also badly constructed, humorless and emotionally sadistic .","30","1060277"
"2267","What's most crushing is witnessing what should have been the dream pairing of Kunis and Timberlake - both foxy, loose, confident performers - here generating zero chemistry.","30","1632708"
"2268","Maybe taking a cue from his namesake dish, that much-maligned Scottish pudding concoction made with sheep innards and root vegetables, Haggis presents a mishmash of genres in this redo of Fred Cavayé's 2008 French film ""Pour Elle.""","30","1458175"
"2269","This ponderous, didactic weepie aspires to ""Titanic"" stature even if the only ship it sinks is itself.","30","119643"
"2270","When bad movies happen to good people, the first place to look for an explanation is the basic idea. That certainly applies to My Week With Marilyn, a dubious idea done in by Adrian Hodges's shallow script and Simon Curtis's clumsy direction.","30","1655420"
"2271","Pale by comparison to an action thriller like ""Children of Men"" or gross out eco-catastrophe like ""Land of the Dead,"" squandering its ready-made zombie scenario.","30","898367"
"2272","So inept you can't even get angry; it's like the imitations of sophisticated entertainment that high-school kids put on.","30","75223"
"2273","At first fascinating and never less than bonkers movie is eventually sunk by its own theological overreach.","30","7984734"
"2274","The chemistry between the leads is nonexistent. Cavill unsuccessfully tries to channel Cary Grant, while Hammer’s Kuryakin has so much inner conflict, it becomes a joke that isn’t funny.","30","1638355"
"2275","There's some cute stuff involving Hanks and some teenagers who tool around campus on scooters, but an utter lack of chemistry between him and Roberts dooms the movie.","30","1583420"
"2276","A big disappointment.","30","217869"
"2277","Gomez-Rejon has erected a gleaming shrine to adolescent narcissism.","30","2582496"
"2278","The failure lies not with the film's director, Marc Forster, nor with its impressive star, Gerard Butler, but with Jason Keller's dreadfully earnest script, which charts the hero's spiritual journey, and his Rambo-esque exploits, without offering a scintilla of mature perspective on his state of mind.","30","1586752"
"2279","Emily Blunt’s Victoria and Rupert Friend’s Albert come across like museum mannequins – utterly devoid of any genuine passion.","30","962736"

"2283","There's no doubt we need more movies for grown-ups, with jokes that don't hit us over the head, but The Men Who Stare at Goats doesn't fit the bill. At best, it might hypnotize you into a stupor.","30","1234548"
"2284","The plot is twisty in a perfunctory way, the action predictably explosive, the sought-after exhilaration nonexistent.","30","4532826"
"2285","What's intractably wrong with the film is that there's no reality to heighten; it's a spectacle in search of a soul.","30","1343092"
"2286","It’s largely a frustrating clone of the original movie — same songs, same script, often even the exact same shot choices — but it replaces every moment of authentic or moving emotion with bombast and hyperbolic overemphasis.","31","2771200"
"2287","Lacking appealing characters (or character design), this misfire will, with any luck, eventually become a forgotten footnote among the output of a production company that has, up until now, shown real promise at making films that defy the usual tropes and storytelling mechanisms in contemporary family-friendly animation.","32","787474"
"2288","Every creative problem White gives himself receives the most boring, trite solution, each chance for artistry stifled by mediocrity.","32","5884230"

"2290","No worse than any disease-of-the-week TV movie, and no more moralistic than any Lifetime drama. But it's no better, either, and it ought to be.","33","264796"
"2291","The second movie, Dead Man's Chest, is everything you feared the first would be: a theme-park spectacle lasting 2 1/2 hours.","33","383574"
"2292","A screaming, silly cliche -- and somehow not a bit scary.","33","160484"
"2293","The end result, at best, is high-toned pulp.","33","476964"
"2294","It's loud, relentless, and difficult to endure, capturing the experience of ground-level alien warfare with woeful verisimilitude.","33","1217613"
"2295","The first major problem with Slender Man is that it’s not anywhere near as scary as many of the fan-made mockups that can be found online right now, but the second and arguably bigger one is that it’s barely a Slender Man story.","33","5690360"
"2296","As broad as Williams goes in these scenes, it’s not really his fault. He’s acting out a screenplay, credited to Daniel Taplitz, that’s peppered with bad writerly flourishes.","33","1294970"

"2305","It's now a straight-up crime and retribution flick, capped off by the dumbest wolf-feeding coda a 13-year-old ever dreamed up.","33","844708"
"2306","While we can perhaps be grateful that the superficiality of Brightburn probably kept it from opting to exploit elements of disturbed-kid narratives that have been all too common in our more tragic news stories, what remains is still never terribly entertaining as either popcorn or a bent take on superhero myths.","33","7752126"
"2307","Campy and cartoonish, Burton’s Big Eyes is not the return to form many were hoping for. It is another phony and hollow piece of sugary kitschploitation masquerading under the guise of an “important true story” that places a nearly grotesque premium on style over any traces over substance.","33","1126590"
"2308","Even the film's one ""original"" twist is just a desperate attempt to link it up to Ghost Rider, the only lousy Nicolas Cage action film that is actually spawning a sequel.","33","1502404"
"2309","As a movie that has positioned itself as the first in a hypothetical wave of representation, Crazy Rich Asians is blatantly diminished by its status. Such a burden is too much for almost any movie, especially one as intellectually, aesthetically, and sociologically featherweight as this, but its flaws are magnified in the face of its goals.","33","3104988"
"2310","A yawn-by-numbers romper-room dud.","33","395699"
"2311","While there are some glittery bits in it, the film is frustrating, cluttered, inelegant and garish.","33","268695"

"2313","A cartoonishly grim supernatural thriller that could stand a lot less talk and a lot more thrills.","33","1038686"
"2314","Fans of either Smith will be sorely disappointed. The elder never before appeared this listless on screen, and the younger misplaced his unforced rapport with the camera that made the Karate Kid reboot so impressive. Only Shyamalan delivers what moviegoers expect from him, and that's a shame.","33","1815862"
"2315","Self-righteous and smug in its use of heartland stereotypes, the movie backfires by assuming that its intended liberal audience is just as intolerant and condescending as the conservative opposition insists it is.","33","1349451"

"2318","Jump scares are all Sandberg seems to have in his bag of tricks, and each is clunkily executed and met with an agonizing, ear-piercing shriek.

"2334","Get On Up is the Hollywood biopic at its near-worst — a formless, extravagant assortment of historical incidents and lip-synched musical numbers, which ultimately amount to little more than a 138-minute showcase reel for Chadwick Boseman’s technically impressive and utterly opaque James Brown impression.","33","2473602"

"2360","Like his (Carrey) early work, it's not a particularly good film -- insipidly staged, inanely plotted, too weak to withstand the weight of any inquiries into logic or continuity -- but Carrey's energetic mugging, particularly early on, makes it relatively painless.","33","315327"
"2361","The all-description storytelling leads to other problems, too, the worst being that ""Boleyn"" suffers from the same affliction as ""The Golden Compass,"" where you're told about interesting stuff happening elsewhere in another movie you'd much rather be watching.","33","467200"
"2362","Wingard’s film is an incoherent mess of tones and styles, confused character motives, and murky narratives.","33","1241317"

"2365","Best laugh at the movies all autumn.","33","146675"
"2366","No doubt the list of talent involved in this remake sounded great, but the project hasn't been thought through as anything more than an arch exercise in style. And even in that trifling end, it fails utterly.","33","857265"
"2367","Most of this just seems, you know, so three years ago, so ""Bourne"" again.","33","758774"
"2368","David Dobkin's film has the faults of raucous recent scatological comedies like ""Bad Teacher,"" ""Horrible Bosses,"" and ""The Hangover Part II"" with none of their redeeming facets. It's scattershot, sexist, and vulgar without being funny.","33","1488555"
"2369","Subplots go nowhere, and characters -- many played by well-known actors -- barely get screen time. Willem Dafoe, Salma Hayek, and Jane Krakowski are among those who are there and gone.","33","450405"
"2370","Whitaker and Schreiber, both of whom are capable of brilliance, are stuck in one-dimensional roles. It’s not only the characters who have mechanical organs; the film itself is equally lifeless and cold.","33","1053424"
"2371","A superficial tale about the casualty at the center of the story, Extremely Wicked, rings hollow and false and is really just as interested in the sensational and salacious as any other reductive thriller.","33","2481498"
"2372","The Avengers is too enervated to qualify as even a full-scale disaster.","33","118661"
"2373","This entire film is like someone raised a kid in a room, cut off from all contact with the outside world, and all he had was a stack of Hustlers, a stack of Soldier of Fortunes, and a bunch of black-and-white stills from old detective movies, and at the age of 14, that kid gets turned loose and spends two hours screaming in your face about these stories he's been writing.","33","458481"
"2374","Ultimately, only Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen, as slacker sidekicks Timon and Pumbaa, make much of an impression; their funny, possibly ad-libbed banter feels both fresh and true to the spirit of the characters—the perfect remake recipe. Just don’t look too hard at their character designs. They’re realistic, hideously.","33","6105098"
"2375","The movie has nothing to offer except titillation.","33","804461"

"2377","By the time Olyphant leaves an enemy in the most ridiculous deathtrap since the '60s ""Batman,"" just because it looks kinda neat, the whole project has started to feel like ""Ultraviolet 2: The Further Stupidening.""","33","465494"
"2378","The people who made Year One seem to think that all you have to do to make a hit comedy is get a bunch of jokesters together. But where are the jokes?","33","1045778"
"2379","Cage has some fun with the role, making Blaze a kind of Zen Elvis with a strange fixation on Carpenters songs, but the film's priorities lie with the digital effects and not the story, and even the effects aren't that hot.","33","259324"
"2380","No matter how basic Hawkins’ book might be in comparison to some of the ones that came before it, it’s hard to argue that it didn’t deserve better than this, that any story so smartly attuned to the need for women to hear themselves and each other should be reduced to such flavorless swill.","33","3631112"
"2381","How could a movie about a great screenwriter have such a terrible screenplay?","33","3203606"
"2382","Bogusly wholesome six-gun dud.","33","244000"
"2383","The movie is a true folly, yet there's no denying that Gilliam has gotten some of the hallucinogenic madness of Thompson's novel on screen.","33","120669"
"2384","Bettany's performance consists entirely of a purposeful frown paired with a menacing glare: He goes about his godly business with solemn, no-frills intensity. The film follows suit.","33","822847"
"2385","So instead of history and drama, we get images, many of them striking but none of them memorable, and noise that deafens until no sense can escape. The events beg for Shakespearean gravity, but the only tragedy here is that so little could be made of so much.","33","414055"
"2386","Woefully inauthentic, milquetoast as a mild breeze and far too tidy for any of its sweeping resolutions to have even the faintest hint of staying power, The Hollars takes 88 minutes to inspire the same warm and fuzzy feeling that a Hallmark card can deliver in a heartbeat.","33","3714720"
"2387","Darkest Hour is pure, uncut Oscar bait that goes through every bullcrap great man biopic platitude imaginable in its two-hour runtime. The reason to rush to such a harsh judgement is perhaps because it’s so damn hard to understand the actual reason for making this film in the first place other than racking up gold statues.","33","4555426"
"2388","Without any of the patented Farrelly insight into the insecure, horndoggy teen in every man, and without a grown-up setting in which Harry and Lloyd can transgress like dum-dum geniuses,Dumb and Dumberer is dumberest.","33","329028"
"2389","The movie doesn't so much extend Schwartzman's antic outsider persona from ''Rushmore'' as uglify it, reducing him to the ultimate Uncool Anti-WASP.","33","240900"
"2390","If Crowe's eyes are open, he seems to have directed most of Vanilla Sky with his mind wide shut.","33","259711"

"2392","The once-talented Mr. Polanski is hard to spot.","34","142688"
"2393","The overused homages and a tacked-on twist ending are just failed attempts to save Repo Men from its own shallow blood lust.","34","1053424"
"2394","Joy has neither comedy nor nuance going for it. Every character feels like a half-sketched first draft, awaiting development that never comes.","35","2446980"

"2398","Aside from a few arresting visuals, Red Riding Hood is just a slog through the woods.","35","1486185"
"2399","Searching is so smart about how we interact with computers that it's surprising how lame it is about moviemaking basics like characters and plot.","35","7668870"
"2400","So what does Guadagnino’s version convey? Boredom, mostly, with confusion and a dollop of disappointment and irritation.","35","1034415"
"2401","The sound is great, the explosions are great, the look and feel could have been turned into something special. It’s the words and plot that are huge negatives here.","35","438488"
"2402","There’s Bullock, doing something good and interesting. Though it does ultimately prove frustrating and sad, watching her so desperately grasp for a finer film—one that lies just beyond what Bird Box allows us to see.","35","2737304"
"2403","Neither intelligent enough to be involving nor fun enough to be trashy, this is a movie that would only work if it were a little worse or a lot better.","35","2873282"
"2404","This movie is little more than a vibrant-looking tableau, a two-dimensional take on an intricate piece of history. It’s a tale that’s been told better before, and Willimon’s modern updates are less enlightened than they initially seem.","35","2328900"
"2405","Shallow characters the audience cares little about, an unbelievable situation rather than a potent plot, and, for those who don’t find men-in-pantyhose or poodle-poop jokes hilarious, not many funny lines.","35","207201"
"2406","The Grudge 2020 is a prestige drama sidelined by lackluster, incoherent horror, ruining the scares and undercutting the humanity of its characters.","35","3612126"
"2407","Whichever side of the aisle you inhabit, you will leave The Iron Lady feeling disgusted; you will also feel cheated - of information, insight or even an identifiable point of view.","35","1007029"
"2408","Feels from start to finish like a throwback to the action cinema and military thrillers of decades past.","35","2302755"
"2409","Sorry to disappoint the fanboys, but this is the first film in the Resident Evil series in which Milla Jovovich neither begins nor ends the movie stark naked.","35","1220634"
"2410","Blanchett, as you’d imagine, is riveting, even when she’s saddled with the movie’s on-the-nose dialogue, not to mention a handful of fairly contrived domestic scenes.","35","3859076"
"2411","Flanagan’s sister piece ensures that its underlying meaning is as close to the surface as the shallow grave discovered in the second act. Flanagan chose to make Doctor Sleep utterly banal. Through means straightforward and blunt, he’s turned a surreal simulation of succumbing to insanity into a plainly stated reminder to always be true to yourself.","35","5606664"
"2412","The Hollars feels so painfully familiar and so dramatically undernourished that even the great Margo Martindale can only do so much with this cliché-riddled script.","35","3714720"
"2413","Batman v Superman addresses Man Of Steel's problems in words without learning anything from it in tone. Instead, the new film doubles down on the grimness, the ugliness, and the indifference to human life.","36","2975590"
"2414","It's not even that the film shifts wildly in tone as much as the fact that none of those tones work at all: the horror parts aren't scary and, surprisingly for Smith, the comedy bits aren't funny.","36","3099498"
"2415","It’s John Goodman who steals every scene. As a scary loan shark who might cough up cash to get Jim out of his pickle, Goodman elevates the material, showcasing the dark humor that Wyatt was clearly going for. But, overall, that comedy just doesn’t land.","37","2039393"
"2416","Even at its lamest and most entitled, this sequel will most likely please fans of the first installment, chiefly because Bateman, Sudeikis and Day are, admittedly, often very funny together.","37","2170439"
"2417","As Above, So Below is inherently absurd, but it would be somewhat less so had it fully committed to just one of its ridiculous premises.","37","2870612"
"2418","The real problem, when all is said and done, isn’t the movie but the man with the microphone in its spotlight. Despite two comedy consultants who worked on the film, De Niro’s Jackie never comes across as especially funny on stage (or especially likable off).","37","1967614"
"2419","Say what you will about Dan Brown’s books. They may be, as some have noted, poorly written, formulaic and pretentious. But at least they hold a reader’s attention, in ways that this excursion — as sleep-inducing and rigidly predictable as a train ride — does not.","37","3062096"
"2420","In all it wastes time, talent -- not least of all Reynolds's -- and money on an obscure mission. [30 Jul 1997, p.C02]","37","118531"
"2421","Lazy humor and familiar plotting aside, Pixels at least gets a little mileage out of its affection for the 1980s.","37","2120120"
"2422","Ultimately, the movie just doesn’t justify its outrageous bid to turn a solemn tale of self-sacrifice into swaggering global-marketplace entertainment.","37","1335975"
"2423","The Zero Theorem doesn’t fully earn the elaborately conceived scaffolding on which its relatively tame ideas are hoisted.","37","2333804"
"2424","The Predator comes across like it’s too timid to fully commit in any one direction, perhaps for fear of alienating some potential segment of the fanbase, and ends up feeling like the least inspiring combination of all possible elements instead.","37","3829266"
"2425","What Polar Bear really lacks is hindsight. It is a little girl’s valentine to her father, without the benefit of bittersweet wisdom that comes with age.","37","1969062"
"2426","The picture seems deliberately trite, blunt, and manipulative, as if the producers didn't trust their audience to respond to anything else.","37","89880"
"2427","It's a kill movie, the filmic equivalent of a hate crime.","37","102266"
"2428","The Boy Next Door plays best as unintentional comedy.","37","3181822"
"2429","Another product from Industrial Light & Magic, this fire-breathing, soaring creature is a technical wonder to behold. But they've skimped on everything else. The script douses the movie's fiery potential and director Rob Cohen soaks all remaining embers with his cheap, made-for-TV direction.","37","116136"
"2430","In the end this “Song” — whose payoff may leave you thinking, “Are you kidding me?” — doesn’t so much crescendo as collapse in on itself, an orchestral work that peters out in a trickle of silly, sour notes.","37","1657517"
"2431","I Saw the Light isn’t just incohesive, but ultimately — and far more frustratingly — incoherent.","37","1490785"
"2432","There are certain pleasures here, mostly in the cast of characters. Malkovich’s misanthropic egoist is chief among them. And Bullock makes for a fierce and relatable Mama Bear. But as for tension, there’s precious little.","37","2737304"
"2433","How ironic then, in a movie about wordsmithing, that The Only Living Boy in New York is tripped up not by tawdry behavior, but by terrible writing.","37","460890"
"2434","Norwegian director Roar Uthaug has had past success with nail-biting suspense, as in his well-received 2015 disaster movie “The Wave.” He can’t quite replicate that same tension here, however. Watching a tiny-but-tough woman survive one danger after another tests not only our credulity, but our patience.","37","1365519"
"2435","Presumably, Scott is giving the audience what it wants, but purists may wonder whether simply re-watching “Alien” would have provided scarier, more genuine jolts.","37","2316204"
"2436","Jessica Lange brings so much energy and personal involvement to her portrayal of Frances Farmer that you can't help but feel sorry for her; nothing else in the film remotely matches her talent and dedication, and she seems alone—and even slightly absurd—in her feverish creativity.","37","83967"
"2437","Easily one of the most gimmicky films of all time, Clue must be the only movie in history to be adapted from a popular board game.","37","88930"
"2438","The Hateful Eight never lives up to its intriguing opening minutes and provocative premise, its wide-screen canvas wasted on a talky, claustrophobic chamber piece that descends, in due Tarantino fashion, into a mean-spirited slough of bloodshed and mayhem.","37","3460252"
"2439","Victoria and Abdul might have aimed for poignancy — and at times it almost strikes that tone — but for the most part, it plays like broadly clownish comedy, treating crusty British prejudice with all the subtlety of “The Benny Hill Show.”","37","5816682"
"2440","With pulpy material to begin with, the film's ham-fisted, novice director Robert Longo seems to be the major incompetent. [25 May 1995, p.M24]","37","113481"
"2441","Director Leonard Nimoy does not use his ears for comedy -- nor his eyes, even. His three leads recite their lines as though they wanted to take their jumbo-sized salaries and run -- which, given this movie, maybe isn't such a dumb idea.","37","94137"
"2442","The film by the stylish fantasist Guillermo del Toro looks marvelous, but has a vein of narrative muck at its core.","37","2554274"
"2443","Goldberg's performance does have its moments, especially once she gets past the frenzy of the movie's first half. But like such accomplished fellow cast members as Maggie Smith and Harvey Keitel, Whoopi is wasted in this godawful nunsense. [29 May 1992, p.17]","37","105417"
"2444","The real trouble with Transcendence is that it just isn’t all that scary — at least not in the way that it wants to be.","37","2209764"
"2445","With so many warmed-over jokes, you’d think that the delivery would at least be on point. But everything, including the timing, feels off.","37","3760922"
"2446","White House Down never quite seems to decide what kind of movie it wants to be, although by firepower alone it qualifies as this summer’s most cartoonishly bombastic exercise in sensory overload (so far).","37","2334879"
"2447","I mean, homage is one thing, but this reeks less of nostalgia than sweat. There is so little tolerance for spontaneity, in a film that feels calibrated to the millimeter to be magical, that reactions like delight and surprise — when they occur at all — feel manufactured.","37","5028340"
"2448","You're obliged to take your fun where you can find it during this coyly coarse-minded, near-wreck of a musical, and there's precious little to be found watching the costars gather moss in each other's uneasy company. [23 July 1982, p.D3]","37","83642"
"2449","Even McAvoy’s reincarnation-obsessed Frankenstein can’t breathe vitality into this shallow adaptation, which careens from moments of horror to serious drama to attempts at comedy that don’t quite land.","37","1976009"
"2450","Only the most committed Aster-pologists are likely to enjoy Midsommar at its fullest; others, meanwhile, may admire its handsome visual design and bravura performances without completely buying in to the alternately diseased and fuzzy fable at its core.","37","8772262"
"2451","Tyldum...isn’t a dynamic stylist as much as a competent executor of what’s on the page. He gets Passengers to where it needs to go, which is a resolution in keeping with a movie that wants to have its cake and eat it too, no matter how much credibility it strains, or how many political and ethical quandaries it elides.","37","1355644"
"2452","Strip away the trite character beats, rote plot points, random dream sequences and other narrative padding, and “Batman v Superman” comes down to the actors, their characters and whether they can sustain interest over the long haul. The answer is yes, if they wind up in the hands of filmmakers blessed with authentic imagination rather than serviceable technical chops.","37","2975590"
"2453","What’s missing here is something, or rather, someone, to care about.","37","1091191"
"2454","As is true with so much of Haggis’s work, Third Person suffers from an airless, too-neat lack of connection with organic life.","37","2343793"

"2456","The Aeronauts is the second film this year by Harper to get a U.S. release, after “Wild Rose.” That film was excellent, with strong music and an effervescent star turn from newcomer Jessie Buckley. This one is, at moments, exhilarating — but not much else.","37","6141246"
"2457","One is hard-pressed to isolate any feature of Now and Then that isn't stale from movie overtime and sentimentality. [20 Oct 1995, p.C17]","37","114011"
"2458","Although her charisma is still undeniable, there’s also no denying that McCarthy is capable of much more than she’s allowing herself to do here. There comes a point when every force of nature starts to look just plain forced.","37","2702724"
"2459","As the years flash by, Mr. Holland ultimately discovers that he has given the world something much more valuable than a symphony; he has touched thousands of lives with the gift of music . . . blah, blah, blah. It almost makes you wanna hurl.","37","113862"
"2460","The movie is presented as the story of a man who hasn’t figured out who he is yet. But that’s not quite right. Instead, it’s a movie that doesn’t seem to know what it wants to be when it grows up.","37","1634106"
"2461","Harper (STARDUST MEMORIES; MY FAVORITE YEAR), a vastly underrated actress, clearly exhibits more talent than this film deserves, its only real standout. Rather than maintain the level of crude, campy fun in the original, SHOCK TREATMENT deteriorates into lame, humorless nonsense that bores rather than amuses.","37","83067"
"2462","Even viewers who are mildly diverted by the whodunit angle are unlikely to find themselves emotionally engaged in the outcome.","37","3631112"
"2463","A bustling, overly busy mess.","37","2226417"
"2464","Tusk seems to harbor no grander ambitions than to create a gross-out gag.","37","3099498"
"2465","The failure of director-writer Peter Hyams to put any weight whatever behind the moral issues (crude as they are) makes this merely violent nonsense.","37","82869"
"2466","On the plus side is the eye-popping production design, although that is also, like the plot, too, too much, dazzling the eye with more fantastical Atlantean technology and — inexplicably — underwater fire than a Las Vegas edition of Cirque du Soleil. Like the frequently shirtless Momoa, it’s pretty at first, then it just hurts.","37","1477834"
"2467","To divulge the plot would spoil the experience -- you'll be shocked to discover, and maybe even surprised to learn, just how lame the damn thing really is.","38","144214"
"2468","On the whole, the film is content to lumber awkwardly between the condemned man on death row and the intrepid reporter on his save-a-life beat -- there's about as much rhythm in the style as there is sense in the plot.","38","139668"
"2469","The filmmakers bite off far more than they're able to chew, resulting in an odd blend of touched-upon topics.","38","1477855"
"2470","Absolutely no one—Oscar voters included—should find Mortensen’s performance anything other than excruciating. From the hand gestures to the accent, it’s as if he jumped out of a vintage photo at The Olive Garden shouting, “Unlimited breadsticks for everahbody!”","38","6966692"
"2471","Neither (Bullock/Reynolds) brings out anything good in the other, and watching them try hurts the eyes, the tummy, and the libido.","38","1041829"
"2472","The tacky and loose means by which the platitudinous screenplay dances around what ails the story's football players is just one cog in a whirligig of pat representations.","38","3322364"
"2473","Kline will break your heart, while the rest of the movie will just make you sick.","38","264796"
"2474","A noisy and lazy stopgap movie that goes absolutely nowhere and takes 2 1/2 hours to get there.","38","383574"
"2475","The net result is a few shaky laughs and one unwavering sensation -- that The Terminal is interminable.","38","362227"
"2476","This is a slick con, all flash and no substance. Now You See Me seems awfully sure of itself, with self-important, intrusive music, sweeping tracking shots and actors chewing up the scenery.","38","1670345"
"2477","It's a nine days' wonder, a geek show designed to win a weekend or two at the box office and then fade from memory.","38","118583"
"2478","It's a good thing this third and presumably final Highlander film will appeal only to those who've bothered to see the first two, because an uninitiated viewer wouldn't be able to make even the slightest sense out of it. [28 Jan 1995, p.C5]","38","110027"
"2479","Considering that the original story managed to be scarier without people's hair spontaneously restyling itself into dragons, it's worth asking why this kind of film has become the norm. Is it because filmgoers demand it, or is it because filmmakers leaning on technological crutches can't be bothered to learn their craft? More and more, I'm leaning to the latter. [23 July 1999, p.C3]","38","171363"
"2480","Even if The Bounty Hunter is more plot-driven than your standard romantic comedy, it's never quite as funny as it should be.","38","1038919"
"2481","Dark and murky, grainy and grim.","38","160484"
"2482","There's nothing worse than a boring behemoth.","38","800320"
"2483","It's a warmed-over suspense thriller that's more disturbing than it is surprising or scary.","38","880578"
"2484","Between fights, the film can't even rely on the luxury of Lindo, Isaiah Washington, Russell Wong, Rottweiler rapper DMX or the scary Henry O as Han's father to make it watchable - the dialogue is wreaking more havoc than Li.","38","165929"
"2485","Planet 51 is cute, but it's no ""Shrek.""","38","762125"
"2486","Neither Scrooged nor Murray, who is front and center throughout, is particularly funny.","38","96061"
"2487","The Gambler is a hollow, overwrought and glibly cynical remake of a '70s drama about a self-destructive academic.","38","2039393"
"2488","Franco can be exhilarating in movies -- tremulous, unhinged, a little wild. Here his jaw never stops quivering and his eyes stay welled up, advertising a breakdown that never comes. Not that Myles has a presence a man would fall apart over. She's too professional to drive anybody crazy.","38","375154"
"2489","The story's appeal is lost in all the fights between the monsters and robots.","38","1663662"
"2490","It contains no poetry. It simply conjures up a horrible feeling -- and then sits back awaiting congratulation.","38","935075"

"2492","The Thing Called Love, Phoenix' final movie, should not be used as a memorial to his career; ""Stand By Me,"" ""Running on Empty"" and ""My Own Private Idaho"" are much better examples of his talent, which was considerable. [12 Nov 1993, p.3G]","38","108327"
"2493","What Amenabar offers here is an unconvincing, pretentiously artsy pastiche of just about every hoary old gothic thriller you can think of.","38","230600"
"2494","Every once in a while there’s an inspired montage, or a one-liner that made me laugh out loud. But how can you have the great Christoph Waltz playing a villain in a comedy, and you get almost nothing out of it?","38","2170439"
"2495","An inferior product. It is not well written, well acted, or well directed.","38","167404"
"2496","It’s more unpleasant than scary, and ever so slow in getting up to speed.","38","2870612"
"2497","H.G. Wells did it better. This movie spends so much yawn-inducing time on variations of the same combat scenario that its final showdown feels rushed.","38","1217613"
"2498","Abbott, Petroni and director Michael Rymer do exploit the visual and aural cliches of vampire movies from the last 20 years: The creatures wear tattoos, shave their heads, listen to blistering rock and dress in black leather. For a band of societal outsiders, they're pathetically conformist.","38","238546"
"2499","Jacques Rivette's film is full of painstaking historical detail, but the behavior of the two nonlovers is mired in inaction and emotionally incomprehensible.","38","781435"
"2500","It's got cheesy special effects, a muddy visual look, and characters who say obvious things in obvious ways.","38","120738"
"2501","Birke's script is plainly straightforward, a simple supernatural chase story. It doesn't plumb the depths of what might make Slender Man scary, so Slender Man isn't scary at all.","38","5690360"
"2502","Angelina Jolie is definitely worth her salt as an action hero, but Salt is never worth its Angelina Jolie.","38","944835"
"2503","The sequel doesn't develop the characters, interject any warmth into its frenetic story or take us anywhere we haven't been.","38","1216475"
"2504","We'd really like to crawl into William Hurt's head and experience whatever movie he thought HE was making.","38","780571"
"2505","In trying to straddle both the grown-up and kiddie worlds with this inappropriately sexualized effort - their first theatrical release since 1995's ""It Takes Two"" - the Olsens have lost their footing.","38","363282"
"2506","Well, it's pretty bad, a long way from the dash and satisfactions of the earlier picture.","38","386140"
"2507","Most of The Fog will seem drearily perfunctory even to those viewers who don't know Carpenter's version, which itself emulated the elegant gloom of Val Lewton's horror pics of the 1940s.","38","432291"
"2508","There is an occasional sense of self-awareness that this is all pointless and silly, but 139 minutes is a long time for a film to forgo even delayed gratification.","38","5691670"
"2509","Ben Stiller's aesthetics blend overly manicured imagery with soaring rock songs that underline every emotion, lest the film's corporate logo-driven message-making didn't get the point across clearly enough.","38","359950"
"2510","If you're the kind of person who goes to the movies primarily to watch faces melt to pulp, you won't be disappointed.","38","163579"
"2511","Every scene in this film, which stars Robert De Niro as the washed-up title character, is dragged out — kicking and screaming — far longer than it needs to be.","38","1967614"
"2512","This is a franchise with lead weights tied around its ankles.","38","3062096"
"2513","In what is surely a tribute to the dazzling mediocrity of director Luis Llosa, the real jungle looks as bland as the fake jungle.","38","118615"
"2514","Its centerpiece is 40 minutes of redundant special effects, surrounded by a love story of stunning banality.","38","213149"
"2515","Allen's laziness is startling, even in so mechanical a filmmaker. He uses a monotonous narrator to tell us what the characters think and do, though he then shows them performing the actions that have just been described.","38","497465"
"2516","A slasher movie about gay panic, a nasty piece of homophobic angst for the age of AIDs. [25 Feb 1986]","38","91209"
"2517","There's still time, but for now, Fogler gets my vote for the worst performance of the year.","38","452625"
"2518","The Critic's Code of Honor forbids me from explaining in detail why the storytelling is so inept, because I'd have to spoil the silly surprises. So I'll say only this: You can interpret the climax two ways, and both will probably infuriate you.","38","1243957"
"2519","A mess. It lacks the sharp narrative line and crisp comic-book clarity of the earlier films, and descends too easily into shapeless fight scenes that are chopped into so many cuts that they lack all form or rhythm.","38","359013"
"2520","The 3D adds little, and the hallmarks of the Chris Columbus directing style are unevenness and luck. With a little of the latter, this could be a huge hit. But with a better star, sharper script and more Dinklage, it could have been a champ.","38","2120120"
"2521","Rarely connects with reality.","38","166943"
"2522","For all the wacky, taboo, parodic situations that MacGruber plunges into, the film seems content to simply point at its hero, yell ""What a schmuck!"" and leave it at that.","38","1470023"
"2523","Blessed with some outstanding performances, among them Ribisi's.","38","181984"
"2524","I would not take very young children to see The Goonies - too intense. I would also discourage any adults who are borderline in their liking of children from seeing this film. The Goonies could easily turn a lot of otherwise tolerant grownups against children, and I'm assuming that would be a terrible thing. [7 Jun 1985, p.75]","38","89218"
"2525","The script doesn't revel in Amy's quite harmless flaws, or at least examine them in the spirit of benevolence.","38","3152624"
"2526","It feels as shopworn as a dusty VHS tape of ""Less Than Zero.""","38","1407084"
"2527","The dull Suburbicon lacks in witty dialogue, interesting characters, or even visual flourishes. It is as flat as the well-manicured lawns in the idyllic neighborhood that gives it a name.","38","491175"
"2528","No amount of youthful charisma can alter the fact that, in the light of ""Dangerous Liaisons"", Cruel Intentions is a feeble and dissatisfying shadow.","38","139134"
"2529","Anthony Hopkins still does elegant menace better than anyone.","38","780653"
"2530","The Search for Spock should be great fun for Trek fans; it's splendid junk when it works. But if you can't hum the theme from memory, Trek III is likely to be just another way to kill two hours. [1 June 1984, p.D1]","38","88170"
"2531","An oppressively cute Manhattan time-travel romantic comedy that’s lost in time, space and cliches.","38","35423"
"2532","Enough can't be said about how the late James Gandolfini comes so close to saving writer-director Nicole Holofcener's latest articulation of white suburban anxieties.","38","2390361"
"2533","Death to Smoochy? Yes, please.","38","266452"
"2534","What it is, distressingly, is a mess - a ragbag of promising ideas and failed narrative, of good acting and plain old bad filmmaking.","38","258153"
"2535","In the hands of some Eastern European masters, stop-motion animation has created some fine adult animated films, like Jan Svankmajer's spooky version of ""Alice in Wonderland."" But The Nightmare Before Christmas is basically a charmless and muddled tale that aims at a target somewhere in the vast gulf between Franz Kafka and Walt Disney and hits nothing. [22 Oct 1993, p.3E]","38","107688"
"2536","The picture only comes alive at the end with Robin and his Moorish helper (Morgan Freeman in a typically strong performance) turning into a medieval Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid in hand-to-hand combat with the sheriff. Otherwise, Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves is an entertainment without a particular point of view.","38","102798"
"2537","For the story of a man who made his mark on pop culture by being a likable buffoon, the irritatingly arch Confessions of a Dangerous Mind takes itself way too seriously.","38","270288"
"2538","Aiming for a piece with the raw impact of ""Precious,"" on which he served as executive producer, he (Perry) ends up with 134 minutes of misjudged intensity.","38","1405500"
"2539","Never achieves the exhilarating feat of exemplifying the types of Hollywood movies it wants to unpack.","38","1092026"
"2540","This is the kind of tearjerker that will cause audience members to cry, but only because they paid hard-earned money to see it.","38","120686"
"2541","End of Watch is pure frat-boy fantasy, the video game to Southland's great American novel.","38","1855199"
"2542","For a movie that aims to make four artists' last spotlit hurrah a revel-worthy moment, Quartet shouldn't urge the viewer to welcome the closing of the curtain.","38","1441951"
"2543","Wild Wild West isn't just a bad adaptation of a TV series; it's a bad film.","38","120891"
"2544","Terry Gilliam has imposed a mix tape of his greatest hits, whose greatness was debatable to begin with, on a whiff of a story that might've flourished under the maxim ""less is more.""","38","2333804"
"2545","John Tucker Must Die is toothless. The jokes are obvious and unfunny, the storyline goes nowhere that's interesting or unexpected, and the only chemistry happens in a science lab.","38","455967"
"2546","Director George Cosmatos brings nothing new to this Wyatt Earp saga except leftover bullets from previous films Cobra and Rambo: First Blood Part II. [23 Dec 1993, p.5D]","38","108358"
"2547","Inherent Vice, meandering even by Anderson’s standards, is easily the worst of his movies, a soporific 2½-hour endurance test.","38","1791528"
"2548","But The Ugly Truth can't escape its own ugly truth, that the central characters are written to extremes both ludicrous and tiring.","38","1142988"
"2549","The film preaches the gospel of unpredictable change, of ironic metamorphosis, of a psychological ebb and flow from love to lust, hope to despair, good to evil. But if the message is fluid, the medium is static at best and chaotic at worst - there's very little controlled motion in this picture. [19 June 1992]","38","103776"
"2550","Ultimately, the film's self-censoring will to sweetness and innocence is even more fatal than the flimsiness of the plot. [22 Nov 1991, p.33]","38","101272"
"2551","There isn’t anything in the bleeding-heart positions espoused by Jorge Bergoglio that complicates Pope Francis’s public persona.","38","8404614"
"2552","With great power comes the responsibility to make a decent movie, but the mysterious force running through Chronicle is the power to supersuck.","38","1706593"
"2553","Fury is a war movie with balls of steel and marbles for brains.","38","2713180"
"2554","What could have made Noah work is the same sense of urgency – of fateful craziness – that made ""Pi"" so memorable, and which also factored into the fatal obsessions of ""The Wrestler"" and ""Black Swan"" (two very flawed movies that admittedly benefited from stronger lead performances than the one here).","38","1959490"
"2555","This booming, cartoonish confection is a transparent attempt to take a property Disney owns rights to, and to try and create a Harry Potter-like franchise.","38","963966"
"2556","The only creepy things about Brightburn, though, are its labored, derivative narrative, its giddy sadism (it gets off on Brandon’s adolescent power trip, and expects its audience to do the same), and its cynical built-in branding.","38","7752126"
"2557","Forgive the fact that actress turned writer-director Elizabeth Chomko is bad at history and math. Dad is driving around in a ’60s GTO with a broken convertible top in the middle of a Chicago winter. No, he’s not driving the Camry.","38","6662736"
"2558","Unfortunately, it isn't until the final scene -- a spoof of the horror genre's false-ending cliché -- that Bats really takes wing.","38","200469"
"2559","In style as in content, it offers neither the granular detail of more subtle period pieces nor enough of Tim Burton's spirited eccentricity to register as anything other than what one character derides as ""that representational jazz.""","38","1126590"
"2560","The camera bobs and weaves like a drunk, frantically. So you have hammering close-ups, combined with woozy insecurity each time more than two people are in the frame. Twenty minutes into the retelling of fugitive Valjean, his monomaniacal pursuer Javert, the torch singers Fantine and Eponine and the rest, I wanted somebody to just nail the damn camera to the ground.","38","1707386"
"2561","What's the message: that women must remain vigilant about poundage to keep husbands from chasing taut-thighed secretaries? That's a charitable Christmas thought.","38","314331"
"2562","Regardless of whatever ephemeral entertainment this production may offer to some, it is not by any reasonable definition a good movie. It is badly written, inexpertly directed, poorly acted, erratically paced, and features music of dubious worth.","38","2848292"
"2563","The movie wields its mockery with the subtlety of a power tool.","38","7043012"
"2564","American Ultra tries to combine a sweet, slacker romance with a slick, super-violent action flick. If that sounds jarring to you, that’s probably because it is.","38","3316948"
"2565","It's the oddest case yet of the Emperor's New Clothes. After all, the Emperor in the fairy tale was naked. This movie has tons of fabulous clothing. The people disappear within their wardrobes.","38","297884"
"2566","Speaking of that middle-finger finale, there is one redeeming trait: At least it signals the end credits.","38","1403177"
"2567","The tediously forestalled twists suck away time from what should be the film's focus—its action—and leaves only two scenes worthy of celebration.","38","2406566"
"2568","Yes, it's a candy-colored Day-Glo world, but there's a liveliness missing from this lead-footed Speed Racer.","38","811080"
"2569","Patrick Lussier is listed as The Director, though I saw no evidence of anyone in control.","38","1502404"
"2570","Hanna presents the problem of the well-made diversion that is, at its core, repellent.","38","993842"
"2571","License to Drive takes too much license with its nuttiness, playing wacky moments to the point where the comedy sputters. [06 July 1988, p.D6]","38","95519"
"2572","Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck’s film prioritizes the sentimental over the true, the tidy moral over the messy reality.","38","5311542"
"2573","While computer games can boast an abundance of nifty graphics and odious villains and plucky protagonists on long journeys, they're invariably a tad wanting in the cinematic essentials -- you know, stuff like plot and characterization and theme.","38","120804"
"2574","There's a risk of taking The Brady Bunch too seriously but, please, let's not think of it as funny, then or now. [18 Feb 1995]","38","112572"
"2575","JUST worth your children's time, and hardly worth yours.","38","395699"
"2576","The movie gives us a time machine that resembles a twin-engined Mixmaster and a script that was tossed together inside one.","38","268695"
"2577","Dopey as the film is on a plot level, it’s equally vapid in its psychology.","38","3170832"
"2578","A Monster Calls is both governed and straitjacketed by director J.A. Bayona’s competent impersonality.","38","3416532"
"2579","To the degree that you will want to see this movie, it will be because of the surprise, and so I will say no more, except to say that the ""solution,"" when it comes, solves little - unless there is really little to solve, which is also a possibility.","38","114814"
"2580","A rote home-invasion thriller afraid to be seen as just another rote home-invasion thriller, the film turgidly grasps for profundity by framing bloodlust as patriotic duty.","38","2184339"
"2581","Glenn Close's perennial look of astonishment and resilience commands the action to the point of turning every other screen element into a gratuitous prop.","38","3750872"
"2582","An undemanding, childish adventure picture.","38","1815862"
"2583","Hanks tries his hand at a king-size heartless comic role, and flubs it terribly. He looks slack and pasty and, what's worse, sounds slack and pasty.","38","335245"
"2584","Butter dearly wants to be a hot-button social satire that plays rough with sacred cows: Midwestern power-moms, the religious right, race, sex, you name it. Mostly, it wants to be an Alexander Payne movie from the 1990s. ""Citizen Ruth,"" say, or ""Election."" Instead, it's a shrill, cartoonish mess.","38","1349451"
"2585","The kind of movie Mad magazine prays for. It is so earnest, so overwrought and so wildly implausible that it begs to be parodied.","38","251160"
"2586","It needed a star like Clooney at its center, and a character actor like Alan Rickman as Dr. Doom. You don't expect realism from a comic-book movie, but you do want the characters to seem larger than life.","38","120667"
"2587","The makers of The Meg may have gone to school on Spielberg, but the big-budget deep-sea thriller is nothing but bloodless summer filler. Unsure if he wants to have some fun and jump the Sharknado or make a seriously gory fish fest, director Jon Turteltaub has surfaced with nets empty.","38","4779682"
"2588","The story is so slight, a low-wattage hair dryer could blow it away.","38","382561"
"2589","An exhaustingly pushy, phallocentric and witlessly smutty spoof of early '80s medieval fantasies such as ""Krull"" and ""The Beastmaster.""","38","1240982"
"2590","Sorta-kinda based on the true story of astronaut Lisa Nowak, Noah Hawley’s directorial debut may have started out as a feminist-forward film decrying the fact that women have to work five times as hard to succeed in the workplace, but it ends up being a movie whose message boils down to, “Ladies be crazy.”","38","4682804"
"2591","Clumsy urban thriller.","38","179626"
"2592","Jonah Hill constantly falls back on providing vague justification for his characters' behaviors, along with spoonfuls of sentiment to let the more dour moments go down easier.","38","5613484"
"2593","The film is a gloomy special-effects extravaganza filled with grotesque images, generating fear and despair.","38","113497"
"2594","The first hour of Die Hard 2 is pretty good, despite consistent improbability. It's the second half, with its consistent impossibility, that looks like ""Tom 'n' Jerry"" or ""Roadrunner."" [6 July 1990, p.E3]","38","99423"
"2595","One smart thing Green's character Ezekiel does is split from Sex Drive as soon as his two scenes are over.","38","1135985"
"2596","Sad to say, poor old Nightbreed fails even as failure - it's bad, but it's not memorably bad. The odor it emits is less the stench of an eternal hell than the stink of a passing purgatory. If nothing is forgiven by the time you've done your time in the theatre, all is certainly forgotten. [20 Feb 1990]","38","100260"
"2597","For a 99 percenter movie, then, Elysium is kind of a head-scratcher. It throws away its best opportunity for drama. It’s as if Han and Leia parked on the Death Star and started asking, “How much is a two-bedroom around here?”","38","1535108"
"2598","Admittedly, I’m far from a fan of Korine’s “Gummo,’’ “Julien Donkey-Boy’’ and the absymal “Trash Humpers.’’ But that he is proud of making intentionally sloppy and tedious movies doesn’t make them any easier to watch. Or all that much fun, for that matter.","38","2101441"
"2599","This rambling, overproduced, tone-deaf melange of romance, comedy and drama is only slightly more engaging than Brooks' other feature this century, the unfortunate Adam Sandler vehicle ""Spanglish"" (2004).","38","1341188"
"2600","Candy and Moranis are real talents, but they're completely wasted, like everyone else here, sacrificed to the grade-school inanities of that self-indulgent script. [26 Jun 1987, p.D6]","38","94012"
"2601","This is film noir for the MTV generation: fast-paced, slick, flashy, gleefully mindless, and hollow to the core.","38","120890"
"2602","A cheap exploitation picture wrapped in miles and miles of stale would-be Oscar scenes.","38","1291584"
"2603","What Raising Arizona needs more than anything else is more velocity. Here's a movie that stretches out every moment for more than it's worth, until even the moments of inspiration seem forced.","38","93822"
"2604","It's a mishmash of ""The Bridge on the River Kwai,"" ""From Here to Eternity"" and ""The Great Escape,"" with everything complex and entertaining siphoned off.","38","272020"
"2605","The movie doesn't do anything with these viney bastards. There's no back story, no satire, no allegory, no implications beyond what's happening on the pyramid.","38","963794"
"2606","A nose-bleeding mass murderer wears a mask that suggests Roger Ebert is knocking off a group of lifelong female friends.","38","242998"
"2607","The only truly graspable notion the film can be said to put forth is one of increasingly tedious sci-fi-romantic genre busy-ness.","38","485947"
"2608","The film finds no treasure of gleaming originality in its energetically told but crushingly clichéd anti-capitalist parable.","38","1800302"
"2609","It essentially uses a major global issue to cheaply dress up what is two hours of hit-and-miss erection jokes.","38","2788710"
"2610","This installment is essentially the same mix as before, with only a better-than-average cast to recommend it. [30 Sept 1995, p.F7]","38","113253"
"2611","Scary Movie 2 has something for potheads and the potty-mouthed alike. Anyone looking for a true sequel, however, will be disappointed.","38","257106"
"2612","Vox Lux has such snarky contempt for pop music—or at least the star-making machinery that governs it—that you wonder why writer-director Brady Corbet bothered to make an entire movie about the subject.","38","5960374"

"2614","This is noir as costume party.","38","7040874"
"2615","The sequel is about nothing more profound than an awkward teenager's desire for a really cute boyfriend. [12 March 1999, Friday, p.N]","38","144814"
"2616","This briefly inspired bit of surreality quickly descends into gratuitous bondage, mayhem and dumb humour, marking the usual progression from mildly absurd premise to gratingly idiotic conclusion.","38","138510"
"2617","If only half as much attention had been paid to story and character as to set design, the cast wouldn't be playing second banana to a gut rehab.","38","245674"

"2619","The entire undertaking feels like a waste of time and talent.","38","825232"
"2620","Struggles mightily to find its loony essence. But Bullock's apple-cheeked larkishness is all flailing limbs and bug-eyed reaction shots - there's no there there. Cooper's character is woefully underwritten, Church's is yet another vain anchorman-wannabe cartoon.","38","881891"
"2621","Orphan is being marketed as a horror movie, but that's misdirection. It's more of a standard thriller in the ""evil amongst us"" mode, about a group of people who inadvertently admit a psychopath into their midst.","38","1148204"
"2622","The Last Boy Scout is no worse than Lethal Weapon, and it's slightly more tolerable than Hudson Hawk. The action scenes deliver, the storyline is efficiently handled (if utterly unoriginal), Wayans is an appealing foil, and Willis' wiseacre personality fits the character he's playing. [13 Dec 1991, p.35]","38","102266"
"2623","Far more grim than ""Grimm,"" and not nearly as much fun as it should have been.","38","1486185"
"2624","In the clumsy hands of director Rob Marshall, this tacky, all-star botch more closely resembles a video catalog for Victoria’s Secret.","38","875034"
"2625","John Hughes pours his usual slickness and sentimentality all over everything. [27 Feb 1987]","38","94006"
"2626","A misfiring black comedy oddly reminiscent of all those bad 1990s movies about strippers getting killed at bachelor parties.","38","144084"
"2627","The story has enough pathos to fulfill the expectations of a great tragedy, but the film feels like a commercial for something else entirely.","38","837563"
"2628","It's problematic enough that the movie's lead characters are unlikable. But worse is the blackening of The Human Stain with a trite and forced plot, uninteresting digressions and clunky direction.","38","308383"
"2629","Motherless Brooklyn feels altogether too tidy, a film that revives many of the touchstones of noir, but never that throbbing unease that courses through the classics of the genre.","38","385887"
"2630","I've seen a lot of rip-offs of ""The Truman Show"" and a lot of rip-offs of ""Scream."" I guess I have to give credit to The Cabin in the Woods for ripping off both at once.","38","1259521"
"2631","Anonymous leaves one bereft of any meaningful knowledge of these personages or the theatrical energy of their age, and earns the obscurity it figures to acquire even if the war between Team Edward and Team William blazes on.","38","1521197"

"2633","Ichaso seems far too interested in what led to Lavoe's downfall rather than what made him great.","38","458522"
"2634","It aspires to Stanley Kubrick's ""2001"", but in its maddeningly unresolved plot threads and cornball cosmic mysticism, it lands closer to ""Mission to Mars"" -though Prometheus lacks any action set piece as gripping as the Brian De Palma film's sentient sandstorm.","38","1446714"
"2635","Watching [Berry] run around in that getup I felt embarrassed, the way I do for people who put on makeup before climbing a StairMaster -- it's too much.","38","327554"
"2636","The purpose of Lynne Ramsay's hodgepodge approach is to distract us from the flimsiness of a story that suggests a snide art-house take on ""The Omen.""","38","1242460"
"2637","Portraying Tubman above all else as a vessel for a higher power ironically only makes her appear less tangible.","38","4648786"
"2638","The movie doesn't really begin or end. Whether the lights have just gone down or the credits have begun to roll, things are pretty much the same for Henry.","38","452694"
"2639","It's just a spectacularly lazy movie that's content to trod the same well-worn ground as its predecessors.","38","413267"
"2640","For most of the movie, however, Halle sprints, Halle swims (55 laps!), and Halle screams. It's a two-hour fitness video -- a portrait of the Oscar winner as personal trainer.","38","348836"
"2641","Lopez is a gorgeous woman with the same mousy voice she came into the movies with 20 years ago. She’s all about the makeup, the hair, the clothes. She plays the part like someone imitating a TV teacher, from her classroom posture to her delivery.","38","3181822"

"2645","The film makes a few starts in many directions but doesn't go very far in any, and that's disappointing to those of us who thought so much of Soderbergh's previous effort. Oh, well, everyone's entitled to a clunker now and then. [7 Feb. 1992, p.3F]","38","102181"
"2646","The best audiences can hope for is that they, too, get amnesia and forget they ever saw this movie.","38","258463"
"2647","Luca Guadagnino's Suspiria is a funereal pseudo-realist drama about political upheaval and the violence of systems that's at odds with itself.","38","1034415"
"2648","Would be a perfectly decent B-action movie if it weren't shipwrecked in the last act by laughably ridiculous plotting and a lazily executed climax.","38","306685"
"2649","A few of the sequences are bad enough to be funny, especially the ones involving Sheen skulking around alien central in a red jump suit, falling down a lot, as if directed by Ed Wood. [31 May 1996, p.52]","38","115571"
"2650","The ratings board gets all twisted up about sex and skin, yet it cannot give you or your kids enough ax blades to the cranium. This week's evidence: the remake of the old Wes Craven horror item, The Hills Have Eyes, which should not be rated R. It should be rated NC-17, or ITTS-OW, which stands for Is This Thing Sadistic, Or What?","38","454841"
"2651","I don't mind that Nights is a potty-mouth benchmark; crude verbiage is appropriate to the leads, as well as the film's subject matter. This is, however, an amazingly mean two hours. Even the funniest gag involves Murphy's fatal shooting of three men. [17 Nov 1989, p.6D]","38","97481"
"2652","Superhero comic book movie with a script so feeble it might have been written with crayons.","38","120903"
"2653","This time the action takes us out of the usual campgrounds and girls in underwear into the realm of outer space, where no one can hear you screaming ""Enough already.""","38","211443"
"2654","Even with Cecil B. Demented, which fails on just about every level, you've got to hand it to him (Waters): The idea for the film is kind of inspired.","38","173716"
"2655","Jeez, did the ""surprise"" climax have to be this eye-rollingly stupid?","38","1197624"
"2656","Ritchie, who shoots and cuts everything in RocknRolla like an ad for a particularly greasy brand of fragrance for men, delivers the beatings and killings in his trademark atmosphere of morally weightless flash.","38","1032755"
"2657","It's a fitfully amusing, not remotely scary slasher picture.","38","1262416"
"2658","Well, Green Lantern isn't ""Jonah Hex"" bad. But it's silly enough to be part of the same ""silliest Warner Brothers comic book summer movies of all time"" conversation.","38","1133985"
"2659","Tim Burton's sense of playfulness feels forced throughout, and as the film progresses, any humor or inventiveness takes a backseat to tumultuous set pieces that reference Frankenstein.","38","1142977"
"2660","Feels like an especially grisly Twilight Zone stretched to five times its length, features Das Boot's Jurgen Prochnow as missing author Sutter Cane and such screen-schlock reliables as David Warner, John Glover and Bernie Casey. None remotely remedies Mouth's bad breath. [03 Feb 1995, p.4D]","38","113409"
"2661","A $100 million production of a 10-cent script, is so clunkily written, so bereft of any engaging ideas or emotions, you'd think De Palma would have sneered at it on first reading and passed","38","183523"
"2662","The film's storytelling and image-making lack originality and vitality. Nothing sticks to your memory unless you come in with recollections of the book.","38","409459"
"2663","Heavy-handed symbolism permeates the picture, down to the leading lady's name.","38","250797"
"2664","It's hard to know what these stars are ready for after this fiasco. Maybe a fitness video.","38","356910"
"2665","A lame little flat liner.","38","134084"
"2666","A ludicrous mishmash undermined by ghastly performances and a hopelessly convoluted screenplay.","38","387877"
"2667","By now, Rocky of the drooping eyes and damaged brain has turned guru, emphasizing heart, soul and family ties when the evil promoter starts goading him and playing mind games with his protege. Stallone, said to be following Arnold Schwarzenegger into comedy, is starting earlier than anyone realized. [16 Nov 1990, p.78]","38","100507"
"2668","If there's anything more tiresome in film today than hip irony, it is forced irony, and here comes a boatload with Wes Anderson's The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou.","38","362270"
"2669","Bullock's character goes through some changes, but she never turns into some unrecognizably serious actress.","38","191754"
"2670","Would somebody please pull the plug on James Bond? It's not that Tomorrow Never Dies is inconceivably bad. What with dashing Pierce Brosnan cavorting as 007, nifty Michelle Yeoh playing chop-socky on bad guys' heads, and a nearly-sentient BMW in Bond's bag of tricks, it's got at least as much going for it as, oh, a good Steven Seagal film. [19 Dec 1997, p.19]","38","120347"
"2671","One could argue that ''Lock, Stock'' and Snatch are essentially the same movie - crime comedies marked by an outlandish visual style. Which raises the question of whether Ritchie has the range to do anything else.","38","208092"
"2672","The movie independently bungles everything it tries, like a Central Park busker who simultaneously sucks at juggling, harmonica playing and skateboarding.","38","1213663"
"2673","This script, this leaden direction ensures that even as the teen wish-fulfillment fantasy, complete with young women playing dress-up, Monte Carlo fails.","38","1067774"
"2674","Nolan pushes the twilight-zone atmosphere so hard that it loses its capacity for mystery. When it's not assaulting us with jolting audiovisual expressions of fatigue, this movie plays like a pedestrian response to David Lynch's effortlessly eerie ""Twin Peaks.""","38","278504"
"2675","Solaris is a film where people...often...speak... like... this, and the camera moves slowly across sterile interiors.","38","307479"
"2676","Hook touches neither fantasy nor soulfulness nor yearning. Mostly, it's benign spectacle in which the actors keep yielding the camera to some expensive playground or other. Hook is neither wistful nor primal. It's film's most expensive wind-up toy. [11 Dec. 1991. p.53]","38","102057"
"2677","In Snow White and the Huntsman, this talented but woefully miscast actress (Stewart) is expected to rally an entire army of soldiers, even though she usually looks like she forgot the combination to her locker.","38","1735898"
"2678","But there is nothing erotic in the coupling between Willis and March, who repeatedly took off her clothes in 1992's ""The Lover"" to much greater effect. The movie is tepid as a thriller, too, since it's not hard to guess the killer's identity and motive. What's worse is that you don't really care about either, though it is fun to see Willis menaced several times by a red - get it? [18 Aug 1994]","38","109456"
"2679","The film disappoints terribly, too. The directorial debut of such an imaginative and clever screenwriter was a highly anticipated event. His ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" are two of the most innovative and intriguing movies of the past decade. Synecdoche is one of the most maddening.","38","383028"
"2680","Ron Howard's by-the-seat-of-your-pants aesthetic makes the slower, darker sequences feel hurried and bland, especially when stacked up next to the racing sequences.","38","1979320"
"2681","A chronic snore. My advice: Roll a fatty and re-rent the first one.","38","195945"
"2682","In attitude, if not aptitude, Robert Pattinson in Remember Me comes across like a latter-day James Dean.","38","1403981"
"2683","Besides the clever name and some striking images from director Dwight H. Little, the only other entertaining bits in Halloween 4 come from Donald Pleasence. [29 Oct 1988, p.C4]","38","95271"
"2684","Con Air has all the signs of a hit. That's depressing.","38","118880"
"2685","The film's annoying glibness is neatly summarized by the line: ""In life, going downhill is an uphill job.""","38","3722070"
"2686","The folks who made this movie apparently had nothing inside their heads, either.","38","164052"
"2687","Ten minutes after you leave the movie, all the battles will have blended in your memory into a ceaseless muddle of sliced-off appendages, jets of blood splashing artfully on walls, gurgling screams and flashing swords.","38","1186367"
"2688","What really wrecks Wolfgang Petersen's Troy is some of the worst casting in recent Hollywood history: The lackluster ensemble hired by the director is overwhelmed by the generally impressive sets and crowd scenes, by the task of playing epic heroes and by David Benioff's rambling, tone-deaf screenplay ""inspired by Homer's 'Iliad.'""","38","332452"
"2689","Starts by cheating death and ends by cheating us.","38","195714"
"2690","Tucker's scenes finally wear us down. How can a movie allow him to be so obnoxious and make no acknowledgment that his behavior is aberrant?","38","266915"
"2691","Lighter on horror than it is on inadvertent humor.","38","389722"
"2692","Satire in a blanket of bland.","38","131369"
"2693","Dragonheart is all dragon, no heart. [31 May 1996, p.3E]","38","116136"
"2694","Childhood: courtesy of Mr. King. Filtered through the pedestrian sensibilities of director Andy Muschietti, who seemingly never met a horror-movie cliché he couldn’t incorporate into his adaptation of King’s thousand-page-plus mega-opus.","38","1396484"
"2695","Rarely have I wanted to fast-forward through a movie as much as Click, a treacly and not-funny-enough Adam Sandler comedy.","38","389860"
"2696","A sentimental and cheerful affair that doesn’t amount to much more than an attempt to tap into their residual good vibes.","38","1086064"
"2697","A movie about healing that makes us want to scream out, """"Hollywood, heal thyself!""","38","225071"
"2698","With some movies, though, it's just the opposite. Like this one. It's a whole lot easier to forget than to forgive.","38","107211"
"2699","The film is one that might have been dreamed up by one of the cynical douche bros from the Hangover during a blacked-out stupor.","38","7286456"
"2700","The Artist neatly sidesteps this unsolvable dilemma by ignoring everything that's fascinating and memorable about the era, focusing instead on a patchwork of general knowledge, so eroded of inconvenient facts that it doesn't even qualify as a roman à clef.","38","1655442"
"2701","The devil is back in Exorcist: The Beginning, and he is more disgusting than ever. Not more scary, just really yucky, in a kind of maggots-on-a-pizza-slice way.","38","204313"
"2702","More toy commercial than movie.","38","1046173"
"2703","Aladdin is ultimately less offensive than patently ridiculous, mostly because its ethnic white noise is really just an excuse for Robin Williams—as a postmodern blabbermouthed genie who grants Aladdin three wishes—to put on the most elaborate, narcissistic circus act in the history of cinema.","38","103639"
"2704","Nothing in How to Lose Friends feels fresh or on target.","38","455538"
"2705","Where the first film was a seminal forerunner of early stalker classics like ""Halloween,"" this version feels as stale as old gingerbread.","38","454082"
"2706","Barrels around in manic fashion much like Carrey does in most of his movies. He's meant to be a fool for love, but mostly he's just bonkers.","38","1045772"
"2707","A blandly middling crowd pleaser.","38","1412386"
"2708","There's so much pluck and gumption on the screen you can smell it. Flesh and blood? Not so much.","38","1129445"
"2709","Might have been funnier if it had been put together with more care.","38","175142"
"2710","Narratively, the film strikes all the sentimental chords that audiences typically find so reassuring, but the music grates here, sounding mechanical and flat, lacking the single ingredient indispensable to any uplifting fable - a charming belief in its own sweet nature. [19 Apr 1996, p. C1]","38","117104"
"2711","The problem isn't that Tarantino's in love with death; it's that he's deadly dull. Even ""Natural Born Killers"" made a stab at social commentary and satire of America?s celebrity-mad media. Kill Bill merely giggles through gore and asks you to smile at its style.","38","266697"
"2712","A brazen title card declares this "" true story."" (Wow, not even ""based on."") However many facts may be accurate, the movie feels contrived, with climax piled upon climax.","38","824747"
"2713","Not only do they (Gere and Ryder) lack chemistry, they lack physics, zoology, botany and geology.","38","174480"
"2714","The film seems almost to have been produced spontaneously, by gears of a larger system as they mesh together right this instant, culled from the ether with the words ""Customers Who Also Liked Dogtooth and Winter's Bone Liked This…""","38","1441326"
"2715","The film is guilty of some of the same quick judgment it clearly doesn't endorse, exploiting Julian Assange's unmistakable appearance to help give itself a boogeyman.","38","1837703"
"2716","May be a spectacularly awful movie, but it's also spectacularly drenched in color, décor and other visual oh-la-la.","38","203009"
"2717","A gaudy yet grim science-fiction horror movie of such surpassing silliness, humorless intensity and stylistic overkill that watching it may actually put you in a state of paranoia.","38","265349"
"2718","In devoting so much time to the dull, counterproductive mechanics of the action assembly, Dunkirk dispenses with nearly all other elements of drama.","38","5013056"
"2719","A flaccidly directed film that basks for two hours in a carefully art-designed simulation of the past.","38","1490785"
"2720","The limp script actually has the characters spout ''Let's get outta here!'' more than once. Or maybe that's just a wise member of the audience talking.","38","263488"
"2721","Lots of buildings and cars explode, but there isn't a spark between any of the characters.","38","257076"
"2722","Glibly put, this challenging time-skipping rumination is the big screen equivalent of watching that ""Tree"" grow.","38","478304"
"2723","There comes a time when the future looks old, and that's where ""Star Trek"" finds itself on the time-space continuum.","38","253754"
"2724","The film takes more than a few pages from the James Cameron playbook.","38","481499"
"2725","It's slick, it has impressive production values and the acting is appropriate to the material. So why did I find myself so indifferent to the movie? Maybe because it never generated any sympathy for its characters. This is filmmaking by the numbers, without soul.","38","93629"
"2726","To succeed, Deception requires viewers to be both inattentive and stupid. There's not a twist in this flimsy and moth-eaten plot that isn't both contrived and transparent and not a character who hasn't been hopelessly manipulated by the needs of the narrative.","38","800240"
"2727","Even the best actors – and this coming-of-age movie boasts a handful of them – can't fight this much tin-eared dialogue.","38","460890"
"2728","Writer-director J.S. Cardone's low-budget mishmash offers precious little in the way of thrills and chills, much less coherent storytelling.","38","245120"
"2729","A high-concept hostage drama of absolutely no value to anyone -- except maybe Bell Atlantic, whose titular street-corner pay phone is on screen for almost every agonizing frame.","38","183649"
"2730","Icky, incoherent thriller.","38","424136"
"2731","Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe attempt light romantic comedy in A Good Year, and the results are as grindingly discordant as a punk band writing a suite of waltzes.","38","401445"
"2732","Painfully dumb. [21 Feb 1989, p.5D]","38","96928"
"2733","Whatever the film's interest may be in the marginalized, writer-director Richard Ayoade never alludes to what would even be worth fighting for in this nightmarish industrial landscape.","38","1825157"
"2734","A rude and seriously crude riff on taking a vacation from marriage.","38","480687"
"2735","In-jokes for horror-film fans abound (the dog is named Jason, the monster in the Friday the 13th series; a cafe is the Craven Inn - Wes Craven directed the first Nightmare on Elm Street), and it's possible that those fans will be satisfied with the expensive, surreal special effects unleashed by director Renny Harlin. Everyone else is apt to agree with the teen-ager who dismisses Freddy by saying, ""We all got better things to dream about."" [19 Aug 1988]","38","95742"
"2736","November is when we eat turkey, and Sweet November is pretty much a fat, juicy gobbler passed off as Valentine's Day date bait.","38","230838"
"2737","What the Hughes brothers have come up with is, to borrow another phrase from that bygone age, a penny dreadful.","38","120681"

"2739","The teen movie The Spectacular Now begins like “Say Anything” but soon turns into “Drink Anything.”","38","1714206"
"2740","Man on Fire is as ludicrous as ""John Q,"" ""Virtuosity"" and ""Out of Time,"" yet substantially more violent, artificial, self-conscious and dull.","38","328107"
"2741","It would also help if they were given some dialogue that was actually funny, or at least more clever than the lines provided to Ashton Kutcher and Katherine Heigl in the distressingly similar ""Killers"" from earlier this month.","38","1013743"
"2742","Other than a few gratuitous montage sequences, plus a patently clumsy echo of the shopping scene in ""Pretty Woman,"" Marshall refuses to pull his share of the load, forcing his beleaguered cast to fend for themselves.","38","163187"
"2743","The opening montage raises expectations of a serious, politically incisive depiction of the region. What we actually get is an offensively pandering, Bruckheimer-esque riff on the real-life Khobar Towers bombing of 1996, a Saudi Hezbollah attack that killed 19 Americans.","38","431197"
"2744","Armageddon may sell tickets, thanks largely to a high-powered marketing machine that's been conducting its own countdown for the past several months. But it's not a pretty picture.","38","120591"

"2746","Like the show, this boring, lazy, clumsily staged, overly lit, unnecessarily 3D-ed contraption even culminates with some half-hearted moral hectoring-in this case, the togetherness of the Smurfs works to validate heteronormative values.","38","472181"
"2747","[Law] talks straight to the camera like the young Michael Caine, but this time our hunk has got zilch to say. That's because a bastard's candour is off-limits in today's politically correct market — it just wouldn't be polite.","38","375173"
"2748","When your set pieces fail to surprise, your dialogue fails to deliver even one decent one-liner and your villain looks like he’s dealing with dysentery on location, maybe 17-18 years isn’t long enough between reboots.","38","1365519"
"2749","Kill Your Darlings presents a minor prelude to a major literary movement.","38","1311071"
"2750","The movie tries to juggle motherly love sentiment with wanna-be snappy ripostes with a violent streak that extends to threatening a grade-schooler with blinding and busted kneecaps. [11 Oct 1996, Pg.03.D]","38","116908"
"2751","Weirdest. Feminist. Movie. Ever.","38","3908142"
"2752","By the time two hours had dragged by, I felt a lot like I had sat through a five-hour wedding.","38","1478338"
"2753","Marines did not play football in full anti-chemical suits in 112-degree weather; men would have been collapsing and perhaps dying because it was so hard to breathe in the gas masks. Do I quibble over details? Details are all the movie offers. There isn't a story.","38","418763"
"2754","The result is a movie that's both clever and stupid - an interesting feat.","38","443274"
"2755","A lot of striking pictures in this would-be feminist ""Braveheart,"" but a film that's pretty flat and earthbound because of the limitations of the figure at its center.","38","151137"
"2756","There are a few laughs at the start of This Is the End, and a couple more at the end of This is the End. As for the endless middle, it’s middling.","38","1245492"
"2757","When “Covenant” is not head-slappingly obvious and perfunctory, it’s just laugh-out-loud ludicrous.","38","2316204"
"2758","The Fourth Kind is a pseudo-documentary like ""Paranormal Activity"" and ""The Blair Witch Project."" But unlike those two, which just forge ahead with their home video cameras, this one encumbers its flow with ceaseless reminders that it is a dramatization of real events.","38","1220198"
"2759","It's a bloated, shockingly tedious trudge that manages to look both overproduced and unforgivably cheesy.","38","903624"
"2760","Unstylized, inconsistent, unconvincing, and familiar to a fault.","38","430308"
"2761","Though saddled with hoary jokes, Goldberg at least pumps some funky life into the bland proceedings.","38","99653"
"2762","Although 1492: Conquest of Paradise is a classier failure than Christopher Columbus: The Discovery, the glum truth is that both are lost at sea. [09 Oct 1992, p.85]","38","103594"
"2763","Predator 2 won't be the worst turkey at theaters this Thanksgiving. But it certainly gobbles loud and often enough.Its makers - whose previous smash-crash hash includes 48 HRS., Die Hard and both Lethal Weapons - go to great lengths to camouflage this bird with ultra-violent dressing. The plot is one bloody showdown after another, on rooftops or in subway cars. [21 Nov 1990, p.2D]","38","100403"
"2764","For a while in the middle, as tentacles began snaking through the ship, the shock value is considerable. But director George P. Cosmatos lets the suspense slide away in ridiculous dialogue and confusing action. By the end, the movie is terrible rather than terrifying. [17 Mar 1989, p.3F]","38","97737"
"2765","The Witches of Eastwick, based on John Updike's novel, takes just about every wrong turn it can find. Perhaps this was predictable, with a wild-driving director like George Miller at the wheel. What's surprising is how many opportunities for vulgarity and stupidity the film invents for itself, even beyond the book's built-in temptations to excess. [12 June 1987, p.21]","38","94332"
"2766","By privileging the white characters in its narrative, Victoria & Abdul exposes itself as insidiously hypocritical.","38","5816682"
"2767","The message of the film is that life isn't neat and predictable like a well-arranged business trip; yet everything in the picture is so calculated that there's no life to it. [23 Dec 1988, A& L, p.19]","38","94606"
"2768","Something in Hutton's wounded puppy look always communicates an untapped intelligence or wasted potential, both of which are perfect for this role.","38","115639"
"2769","From the start, it's obvious that this is a vehicle for his comedy, and it mostly works -- for about ten to fifteen minutes. After that, Carrey's act gradually grows less humorous and more tiresome, and the laughter in the audience seems forced.","38","109040"
"2770","Jennifer’s Body falls into the dispiriting category of dumb movies made by smart people, in this case a glibly clever writer and a talented director who think a few wisecracks are enough to subvert the teen horror genre.","38","1131734"
"2771","Gibson mounts a convincing crucifixion, but his victim is the audience. The Passion of the Christ aims its metallic cat-o'-nine-tails at the viewers' nerves.","38","335345"
"2772","No amount of excellent period costuming and brilliant set decoration can substitute for a good story and decent acting.","38","120338"
"2773","This is a movie that talks endlessly about emotion but displays none of it — and the same can be said for all that destiny chatter.","38","6423362"
"2774","A film that really has no idea what it wants to be, so it tries a little of everything, and does nothing very well.","38","142688"
"2775","One could easily argue that, like many Ed Wood-type bad movies, The Faculty might be headed for the cult classic shelf in the video store. Unfortunately, it's not campy enough, and, worse, it seems to think it's being hip when it's just being dumb.","38","133751"
"2776","The director is James Foley, who is obviously not right for this material.","38","142192"
"2777","Forgetting that French New Wave directors often turned to Hollywood for inspiration, cinema snobs will doubtless be outraged that Hollywood would dare remake such a beloved Rohmer masterpiece, when in fact, tone aside, ""Chloe In The Afternoon"" isn't all that different from ""The Seven Year Itch.""","38","770772"
"2778","Zombies. Nazis. Clichés. Insane violence. Overlord delivers a whole lot of much too much.","38","4530422"
"2779","The cast excels at transcending its material. The script by Justin Haythe matches Francis Lawrence’s direction; it’s workmanlike and steady and pretty flat.","38","2873282"
"2780","At its best, Dumb and Dumber is like an Ernest movie with a scatological bent.","38","109686"
"2781","A germophobe's worst nightmare, Contagion touches on all the dramas big and small, mostly big, we've come to associate with catastrophes such as this, and does so as if it were hurriedly going down and adapting a list of bullet points, never lingering on any one drama in a particularly meaningful fashion.","38","1598778"
"2782","Wild Hogs is more tired, worn out, and sagging than its protagonists - an arthritic comedy whose humor is below mediocre and whose drama is cringe-worthy.","38","486946"
"2783","Can be summed up by the fact that Ashton Kutcher, making a glorified cameo as a narcissistic model-slash-actor, is the best thing in it.","38","349205"
"2784","The script, based on a novel by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard, is deeply dumb, depressingly derivative (ripping off ""Planet of the Apes"" the most) and just plain nonsense.","38","185183"
"2785","Harold is death, Maude life, and they manage to make the two seem so similar that life's hardly worth the extra bother. The visual style makes everyone look fresh from the Wax Museum, and all the movie lacks is a lot of day-old gardenias and lilies and roses in the lobby, filling the place with a cloying sweet smell.","38","67185"
"2786","Although there are several truly jolting scares, there's also an abundance of hackneyed dialogue and more silly satanic business than you can shake a severed limb at.","38","288477"
"2787","The best way to sit through Max Payne is by using minimal brain.","38","467197"
"2788","This ""Holmes"" is just about as silly as it awesome. At times, Ritchie and company try so hard to make sure this isn't your father's ""Sherlock Holmes"" that it comes across as, well, cartoonish.","38","988045"
"2789","The script's jumble of plot asides and family-friendly pandering is enough to make you want to root for a hero.","38","1690953"
"2790","Over on the aliens side, it's hard to make out faces, but there's no doubt about their place of origin: These slimy, growling, bug-eyed and distinctly non-scary things are straight from central casting.","38","409847"
"2791","You may not be able to keep your lunch down after viewing his film, but you'll at least be momentarily intrigued. [24 Sep 1987, p.C6]","38","93177"
"2792","The picture is apparently intended to mimic the bleak futurism of Blade Runner, but with its cheap look, punk styling and dirty-looking restrooms, Johnny Mnemonic looks more likes a bad East Village nightclub. Furthermore, Longo's staging of action sequences is bland, and he doesn't seem to understand character development at all. [26 May 1995, p.36]","38","113481"
"2793","Sniggery sex, adolescent male-bonding, casual drug use, the agonies of growing up, mistrust [to put it mildly] of the adult world, a yearning for material success and a corresponding distaste for anything that smacks of the ""committed"" 1960s - it's all here, supporting a plot so lunatic that it could have been assembled only in the backwards fashion outlined above. [22 July 1983, p.3-3]","38","85346"
"2794","Writer-director Lorene Scafaria's film is an unconvincing character study that plays like a painfully unfunny sitcom.","38","4501454"
"2795","Silly, sadistic and finally a little galling, Kingsman: The Secret Service answers the question: What would Colin Firth have been like if he'd played James Bond?","38","2802144"
"2796","This one is a “different kind of superhero movie,” meaning even more fiercely attached to the mode of artistic expression known as “puberty.”","38","1431045"
"2797","Highlander's flashy style is the cinematic equivalent of a Las Vegas chorus line: always kicking. Without Lambert, who displays an unexpected comic talent along with intensely photogenic passive-aggressive eyes, and Roxanne Hart, whose knowledgeable portrayal of a New York detective is undercut by the symphony of screams extracted from her toward the end, and Connery, who wears a pearl-drop earring and is supposed to be Spanish but still has the burr and brio of James Bond, Highlander would be little more than an everlasting video; it's not much more than that, as it is. [10 Mar 1986, p.C9]","38","91203"
"2798","Sanctum tells the story of a terrifying adventure in an incompetent way. Some of it is exciting, the ending is involving, and all of it is a poster child for the horrors of 3-D used badly.","38","881320"
"2799","Breakdown is the latest in a seemingly endless traffic jam of thrillers that opens strong but finishes abominably.","38","118771"
"2800","If both good and evil characters don't behave in ways that make sense vis-à-vis their circumstances, any sense of terror quickly dissipates.","38","1603257"
"2801","This movie is made by and for people who don't care about good storytelling.","38","477347"
"2802","Fun for less than 30 of the 80-minute running time.","38","185371"
"2803","I find Lars and the Real Girl adorable in the worst way, bailed out only by most every member of its excellent cast.","38","805564"
"2804","Definition of redundant: A formulaic Hollywood pic that calls itself Déjà Vu.","38","453467"
"2805","Board games, threats from Howard and desperate escape planning by Michelle take up most the picture. And then, first-time feature director Dan Trachtenberg and the screenwriters, apparently realizing that not much has been going on so far, ramp up to a full-bore CG explosion extravaganza finale...Too little. Too late.","38","1179933"
"2806","Comes up short when things get serious, resorting to cliches and a whole lot of hooey about ""moral fiber.""","38","265208"
"2807","Gosling's been better elsewhere but delivers an adequate performance. McGregor and Watts seem baffled most of the time, as well they might be. Forster keeps us from drifting off with inventive camerawork; in this case, that's like saying a hideous suit has well-stitched lapels.","38","371257"
"2808","Ghostbusters II is such a lazy effort that the formula machinery is laid bare for all to see. It suffers from writing that is obvious, sloppy, and unimaginative.","38","97428"
"2809","From an audience perspective, the title’s fairly apt as well.","38","330793"
"2810","Astonishingly, Angels & Demons IS the same sort of lumbering mediocrity.","38","808151"
"2811","Juices up the visuals with fancy camerawork and split screens, but it can't distract enough from the vulgarity of the material.","38","292644"
"2812","The Hangover is like an infernal comedy machine. Surrender your soul to its foul mesh of cheap cleverness and vulgarity. and you howl like a delighted demon. Resist, and you feel all sense and sensibility being crushed in its cogs.","38","1119646"
"2813","This is a repetitive, pointless exercise in genre filmmaking--the kind of movie where you distract yourself by making a list of the sources.","38","120399"
"2814","There's no comic edge at all to Sister Act. It's all Whoopi and the three sisters, battling plastic writing and chintzy production values, convincing you that filmmaking this pedestrian ought to be declared the eighth deadly sin. [29 May 1992, p.34]","38","105417"
"2815","What Dick rendered potent, Nolfi renders preposterous.","38","1385826"
"2816","It's two hours of slumming in a vision of hell hatched from bourgeois comfort. That, and not its unsavory subject matter, is what makes it bummer theater.","38","180093"
"2817","Questions: Did everyone involved in this botched thriller OD on speed? Does jimmy-legs director D.J. Caruso think if he slowed down the action we'd figure out how stupid the plot is?","38","1059786"
"2818","A dreary, Carrie-type shocker about a high school student seeking to kill a bunch of classmates on their prom night. Very few thrills. [01 Aug 1980, p.10]","38","81383"
"2819","Bill Forsyth's films are always idiosyncratic, but Being Human is so steeped in the director's interior dialogue with himself as to be incomprehensible to anyone who doesn't happen to be Bill Forsyth","38","106379"
"2820","Don't put yourself through this hell.","38","185431"
"2821","Becomes exceedingly disgusting when it wallows in the psychological torture of a child, a no-no under any circumstances.","38","387564"
"2822","Punch-Drunk Love buries a terrific performance by Adam Sandler under a heap of faux cleverness, meaningless symbolism and irritating mannerisms.","38","272338"
"2823","I don't know if the new movie is Smith's weakest. It's certainly his most disposable, a warmed-over hash of jokes that will have Mewes fans rolling with laughter and the rest of us rolling our eyes in disbelief.","38","261392"
"2824","The best story here is the one about how Stolen Summer made it to the screen; that's more compelling than anything that happens in Pete's world.","38","286162"
"2825","It certainly suffers from the staleness of its off-the-cuff, improv-inspired mode of comedy, which prizes free-form riffing over organically constructed comedic scenarios.","38","1758830"
"2826","This movie is so tone-deaf it would only make sense in Vincent van Gogh’s missing ear.","38","2582846"
"2827","In so clearly viewing Lili through the lens of 21st-century political correctness, the film only blunts the resolve of her struggle.","38","810819"
"2828","This is all a long way of saying that the best way to better understand the man who made those and dozens of other movies is simply to see them. There's no case to be made for a mangy shortcut like Hitchcock. It's all surface and formula.","38","975645"
"2829","Blockers is the latest example of the millennium’s most dispiriting film trend: Stupid drunk people making stupid drunk decisions for two stupid hours.","38","2531344"
"2830","The Abyss' isn't abysmal, but it's a replay of hits we've already seen - a recycled ""close encounters of the wet kind'' with far too few ideas of its own. [18 Aug 1989, Arts, p.10]","38","96754"
"2831","There are those who will no doubt call The Postman the worst film of the year, but it's too good-hearted for that.","38","119925"
"2832","The movie's uninteresting characters, boneheaded dialogue and flagrantly nonsensical narrative detract considerably from the virtues of the visual design.","38","455760"
"2833","A relatively harmless (and thankfully, not entirely laughless) trifle.","38","372532"
"2834","Directors Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg (“Kon-Tiki”) seem to not have the slightest idea how to make this material sing; instead, it’s mostly a noisy, dark 3D blur in which the characters run around a lot, seemingly looking for the exits","38","1790809"
"2835","It's a modestly effective but jaw-droppingly violent picture.","38","472399"
"2836","Inventing the Abbotts would be a lot more fun were it a trashy Troy Donahue-Diane McBain vehicle ground out by Warner Bros. in 1960, the year this hormonally motivated high school-college romance mercifully concludes.[4 April 1997, p. 4D]","38","119381"
"2837","This thoughtful but windy and winded sci-fi thriller shortchanges the science – understandably - and the thrills. The directing debut of “Dark Knight” cinematographer Wally Pfister is a mopey affair with indifferent performances, heartless romance and dull action. It transcends nothing.","38","2209764"
"2838","A slow train to Dullsville that makes all local stops. You know a film is in trouble if the most interesting thing in it is the luggage.","38","838221"
"2839","For long stretches of the PlayStation-minded Gamer, the action does drag.","38","1034032"
"2840","As far as shameless excuses to rehash crowd-pleasing gags from the first film go, it doesn't particularly go about its duties cynically.","38","3760922"
"2841","The film wants to treat Jeffrey Dahmer like a character, but it invariably frames him like a specimen.","38","2291540"
"2842","Some of the special effects are chilling, but Fright Night lacks depth, wit and humor, and hence is neither absorbing,intelligent, nor funny. [08 Aug 1985]","38","89175"
"2843","If truth in advertising applied to movies, they would have titled this one ""Reheated Cultural Leftovers.""","38","2091935"
"2844","Slow-witted, clumsy and almost pathologically reliant on crude name-calling for laughs - Horrible Bosses represents the lowest end of the comedy spectrum.","38","1499658"
"2845","There's a blank space at the core of Molly's Game that the protagonist cannot fill, unable as she is to represent anything beyond her esoteric narrative of unorthodox self-actualization.","38","4209788"
"2846","Yes, from ""Blonde"" to ""Bunny,"" it's abundantly evident that the two scribes have mastered, truly mastered, the serious art of self-plagiarism.","38","852713"
"2847","Mark Felt is a kind of hagiography, and it leans toward whitewashing its subject's legacy, which extends even to the man's illegal break-ins and wire-tapping of the leftist activist group the Weather Underground.","38","5175450"
"2848","The characters are so flat and the dialogue so dull you expect it to be one of those movies whose existence is justified by a big final twist. But it's three days after the screening, and still no twist. Maybe it's coming in the mail?","38","366627"
"2849","It’s preposterous schlock masquerading as art.","38","1392214"
"2850","The first All Talking Killer picture. After the setup, it consists mostly of characters explaining their actions to one another.","38","184858"
"2851","As a film, it's flabby and utterly predictable.","38","1000774"
"2852","The Happening is a movie to walk out of, sleep through, or - best of all - not to bother with.","38","949731"
"2853","17 Again errs not only by covering such well-trod ground, but also by doing so through a main character - played by a game but ill-served Zac Efron - who's about as dense as they come.","38","974661"
"2854","The Nun is the cinematic equivalent of a Conjuring-inspired maze at Halloween Horror Nights at Universal Studios.","38","5814060"
"2855","The pretentious title might be trying to make a statement about the new, fast-moving economy. It's also a weak reference to the first Wall Street. But mainly, no, it's just pretentious.","38","1027718"
"2856","Delpy's injection of class into an otherwise classless production raises the specter of what this film could have been with a better script and a better cast surrounding her.","38","118604"
"2857","If the idea is to teach us something about the 37th president of the United States, then you would think Stone would resolve to stick to what can be proven about the man's life, or at least indicate when he's speculating. But Stone is the Great Explainer, and facts have an annoying habit of mucking up his explanations.","38","113987"
"2858","A one-trick action thriller that feels like a poor cousin of an episode of ''24."" Call it ''12.""","38","421239"
"2859","With a grating combination of naivete and arrogance, The Green Mile consistently overplays its melodramatic material, including a portrait of a black man that is as breathtakingly offensive as it is earnest.","38","120689"
"2860","All this movie has in common with its ancestor are speedboats, shotguns and drug-dealing Colombians.","38","430357"
"2861","Dan Fogelman’s Life Itself packs in enough narrative twists and turns to leave viewers with a sense of emotional whiplash. One tragedy bleeds into another so often that the events begin to blur.","38","5989218"
"2862","A leaden, violent and tone-deaf script and two surprisingly unfunny stars — one trying WAY too hard and the other not trying at all — bury The Spy Who Dumped Me.","38","6663582"
"2863","Isn't serious enough to fulfill its ambitions, or funny enough to compensate for its failures.","38","243133"
"2864","If you’re going to invest three hours watching a movie about a convicted stock swindler, it needs to be a whole lot more compelling than Martin Scorsese’s handsome, sporadically amusing and admittedly never boring — but also bloated, redundant, vulgar, shapeless and pointless — Wolf of Wall Street.","38","993846"
"2865","Diary of a Wimpy Kid the movie returns Kinney's tale to live-action reality, and the party's over.","38","1196141"
"2866","The director’s pedestrian tactics are most evident in his command, or lack thereof, over his cast. While Parker knows how to expertly play to the camera – he all but winks at the audience, so confident is he in his admittedly captivating lead performance – he abandons his fellow actors, allowing them to exploit their worst instincts: hammy accents, wild gesticulating, uneasy line readings.","38","4196450"
"2867","The film quickly reveals that the only angle it’s interested in is the one that most sympathizes with Gary Hart.","38","7074886"
"2868","Surrogates, which borrows tone and content freely from ""I, Robot,"" is all windup and no pitch.","38","986263"
"2869","Those who don't understand what it means for an actor to ""sleepwalk"" through a performance need only watch Men in Black III; there's no shortage of examples.","38","1409024"
"2870","But here's the problem: Bruce Campbell's character is a complete stiff, and so is everyone else he meets who isn't a special effect. The result is that we couldn't care less who wins any battle in the movie no matter how inventively photographed. What about a love interest? Embeth Davidtz, as the lady who's waiting, doesn't have a sexy scene in the movie. [19 Feb 1993, p.C]","38","106308"
"2871","There's plenty of action, but it's all the same.","38","473075"
"2872","The one saving grace in Halloween III is Stacey Nelkin, who plays the heroine. She has one of those rich voices that makes you wish she had more to say and in a better role. But watch her, too, in the reaction shots: When she's not talking, she's listening.","38","85636"
"2873","Even the special effects alone aren't worth the price of admission.","38","163025"
"2874","Yes, this film is worse than ""Cliffhanger,"" Stallone's last venture into chaos.","38","106697"
"2875","Unfortunately, Mary Poppins Returns falls quite short of being practically perfect in every way. The cast puts on a good show, but very little can be done to salvage the forgettable numbers by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman and dance routines that already look dated.","38","5028340"
"2876","The movie’s a somber affair, but if you see it in the right frame of mind, it’s the guilty-pleasure hoot of the season.","38","1967545"
"2877","For his fourth paycheck-cashing run through “J-Bruck’s” action-hero gauntlet, Cage lazily plays Benjamin Franklin Gates-the first of many overstuffed social-studies references.","38","368891"
"2878","As before, the movie is more impressive for its finely detailed vision of Los Angeles as a futuristic slum than for its story, acting, or message. It's all downhill after the first few eye-dazzling minutes. [2 Oct 1992]","38","83658"
"2879","Watching Attack of the Clones is like getting rapped on the head with a rubber mallet -- no lasting damage (I pray and hope), but bad enough to bring on an acute bout of dizziness and disorientation. Definitely do not operate heavy machinery after viewing -- this behemoth is brutal.","38","121765"
"2880","Feels perfunctory and obligatory and, despite the return of several familiar characters, is more like an afterthought than an organic third piece of a trilogy puzzle.","38","859163"
"2881","There are no people to watch in Fantastic Four, only collections of character traits and attitudes brought fitfully to life by actors who might've mistakenly thought they were hitching a ride on the superhero movie gravy train by signing up for this misfire.","38","1502712"
"2882","A letdown, another comedy that's strange for the sake of being strange. This one's a riff on detective movies. It has nothing to say but does take a long time to say it...the film plays like a bad inside joke. [2 March 1998]","38","118715"

"2888","The meager comeuppance and hasty notes of sweetness that end the film feel pre-approved rather than organically realized.","38","2170299"
"2889","A laughably bad horror flick.","38","1139668"
"2890","Watching Dune is a bit like trying to dig your way out of a sandstorm. Wave after wave of lore and nomenclature pile up around you until you finally succumb, and are buried. At which point you’re best off giving up on the movie as any sort of coherent, compelling piece of science-fiction and simply embrace it as camp.","38","87182"

"2892","All the special effects in the universe don't make up for a lame plot, though. There's something foul about a Star Trek movie so apparently slapdash: the creators know that legions of fans will show up, no matter what. [18 Nov. 1994]","38","111280"
"2893","Superman IV works rather well as a children's movie. It even has a line or two for adults -- though not, one hastens to qualify, enough to actually warrant adult attendance. [25 July 1987, p.B1]","38","94074"
"2894","Verhoeven's lurid thriller has moments of welcome self-parody, but most of the action manages to be sensationalistic, homophobic, and tedious at the same time. [20 Mar 1992, Arts, p.12]","38","103772"

"2901","There’s barely an original thought or novel theme in Creed II, a movie that wrings more bloody-nose money from the original “Rocky” sequels in recycling characters, themes, fights and situations and putting Michael B. Jordan and Tessa Thompson instead of Stallone and Talia Shire in them this time.","38","6343314"
"2902","The movie doesn't even have novelty on its side, since we're basically watching the original ""Final Destination"" all over again, minus the smarts and humor.","38","309593"
"2903","Isn't even worth a glance.","38","204626"
"2904","A lazy, hasty effort that offers little beyond a few jack-in-the-box startles and a high body count, including Hewitt's bouncing about in a shirt half-unbuttoned over a bikini top.","38","130018"
"2905","The problem with the taboo-busters is that they feel calculated - in the past, Lynch's creepiness seemed casual and natural - and they take Wild at Heart so high it can't come down; the picture repeatedly jacks itself into frenzy only to crash into lethargy.","38","100935"

"2910","Perhaps because Campbell is a purist at heart, My Name Is Bruce is as awful as anything he has done - a broadly silly gore comedy in which no gag is too cartoonish to be indulged in at least once and preferably three times.","38","489235"

"2913","Except for a brief episode in which singer Chris Isaak and Kiefer Sutherland make like an FBI Rocky and Bullwinkle, this is a morbidly joyless affair.

"2916","In the earlier films, we really identified with the small cadre of surviving humans. They were seen as positive characters, and we cared about them. This time, the humans are mostly unpleasant, violent, insane or so noble that we can predict with utter certainty that they will survive.","38","88993"

"2918","There is a terrific little movie making the rounds, Repo Man, that demonstrates what can be done with vision, no money and faith in the audience; Buckaroo Banzai demonstrates what can be done with a lot of money, no faith in the audience, and a vision that begins and ends in the cash register. [13 Aug 1984]","38","86856"
"2919","If it worked, The Fast and the Furious would put viewers in the same position as the policeman protagonist, attracted to speed but appalled by crime. Instead it sentences you to an hour and a half in a high-decibel limbo.","38","232500"

"2921","Drop Dead Ugly is more like it.","38","157503"
"2922","A film that pays lip service to some interesting ideas, but is far too concerned with pleasing a large crowd to be anything more than another instantly forgettable fright flick.","38","492044"
"2923","Just like the titular vehicle, the movie sputters along toward its intended (and entirely predictable) destination. Even having tremendous actors like Sutherland and Mirren in the front seat can’t enliven this vacation.","38","3741632"
"2924","The clichéd and predictable Suspect Zero is the latest evidence that Hollywood has run the serial-killer thriller into the ground through overuse - the same way it earlier exhausted, say, buddy action-comedies.","38","324127"
"2925","The standards for comic book superhero movies have been established by ""Superman,"" ""The Dark Knight,"" ""Spider-Man 2"" and ""Iron Man."" In that company ""Thor"" is pitiful. Consider even the comparable villains (Lex Luthor, the Joker, Doc Ock and Obadiah Stane). Memories of all four come instantly to mind. Will you be thinking of Loki six minutes after this movie is over?","38","800369"
"2926","Alien Nation lives out precisely the fate of the alien nation it depicts - both full of potential, both hoping toplease, and both immediately co-opted, enslaved by the same commercial forces that granted their release. [12 Oct 1988]","38","94631"
"2927","You wouldn't call The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day a taut thriller. More like a fleshy, messy, jangled frenzy of shootouts and much discussion about the mechanics of romantic entanglements that bloom between prison inmates.","38","1300851"
"2928","For die-hard Ferrell fans, this could be the ultimate test. He has been playing variations of ""Elf"" for five years, and his antics have grown as stale as Jackie's socks.","38","839980"
"2929","The transition from Hanna-Barbera animation to manic-barbaric live action falls flatter than a granite slab, from the first of many deadly stone-age wordplays - ""Steven Spielrock Presents"" - to the gross-out shots of dirty tootsies. [27 May 1994 Pg. 01.D]","38","109813"
"2930","This movie fails so spectacularly - and on so many levels - that it's like watching a train plummet off a bridge.","38","448157"
"2931","It doesn’t take itself too seriously, but it’s not nearly as self-deprecating and funny as it needed to be.","38","5519340"
"2932","The sequel goes down the tubes by spreading itself across four time zones and inviting comparison to the original by spending most of its time back in 1955, where another mess must be set right. [22 Nov 1989, p.35]","38","96874"
"2933","With movies like this, Lopez might want to start leaving low-end romantic comedies alone and look at her movie career's backup plan.","38","1212436"
"2934","In the final frames, and the final analysis, Alien gets the worst of both worlds - it's boring and it's messy. The title may be ""cubed,"" but the movie looks awfully square. [22 May 1992]","38","103644"
"2935","God may forgive you for seeing this needlessly brutal film. But you won't forgive yourself.","38","1602613"
"2936","Wavers uncomfortably between satire and dime-store existentialism on the big screen. It's sort of as if Charlie Kaufman rewrote ""The Fountain.""","38","810988"
"2937","When you combine the megawattage of Gyllenhaal and Adams with Ford’s directorial … well, “prowess” would be too strong a word, so let’s go with “vision.” So, when you combine those two actors with Ford’s vision, what you get is a ridiculous, high-camp mess that could easily be mistaken for substance, if it weren’t so irredeemably silly.","38","4550098"
"2938","A woefully underwritten motion picture that starts out as a dumb comedy before taking an ill-advised detour into mawkish sentimentality. The last 30 minutes of Bruce Almighty is so godawful that it almost sent me screaming from the theater.","38","315327"
"2939","Snyder is not without skills, or ideas, but when a critic finds himself at odds with almost every aspect of a director’s visual approach to material like this, material like this becomes pretty joyless.","38","2975590"
"2940","This version 3.0 needs an upgrade.","38","432021"
"2941","Not good enough to take seriously and, sadly, not bad enough to be any fun.","38","467200"
"2942","With the performers given zilch to perform, the result is a picture that's all chassis and no engine, or, in the parlance of the genre, a bunch of pointy hats in search of a transporting broomstick.","38","120791"
"2943","Norbit is pretty much a bad-taste sinkhole.","38","477051"

"2947","It's ploddingly directed, indifferently acted and insufficiently frightening.","38","134119"
"2948","Is the Crystal Lake PD really doing such a good job? You'd have to go back to Phnom Penh in 1975 to find a place with a higher per-capita rate of unprosecuted homicides.","38","758746"
"2949","It's not just about a disaster, it is a disaster.","38","120696"
"2950","I hated it, but I grant that it does tap into a vein of technological horror - the fear of the VCR! - that will have young videophiles chatting it up for weeks","38","298130"
"2951","Ordinarily, one decries the violence in the streets, in life or art - or rationalizes that violence on the screen is a healthy outlet for man's inhumanity to man. But there's no such highfalutin psychology in The Killer. The film is just plain outlandish - and anyone who doesn't get the hyberbole should have a 99-year lease on The Farm for the Bewildered. [16 Aug 1991, p.3F]","38","97202"
"2952","An unrelenting assault on the brain and eardrums.","38","340163"
"2953","Wastes a moderately intriguing premise by filling it with laughably clichéd dialogue, one-dimensional characters and implausible turns of events.","38","421073"
"2954","The year's most beautiful movie -- and surely one of the dullest.","38","120834"
"2955","Despite aping its title in order to suggest quality by association, Bad Teacher has nothing in common with ""Bad Santa"" -- including, alas, a genuinely nasty sense of humor.","38","1284575"
"2956","There's so little action or suspense that this Cell isn't too likely to multiply itself into a sequel.","38","209958"
"2957","A dog-frequency movie: enjoyable only to those tuned in to its particular register.","38","446029"
"2958","Like his prior ""The Kingdom,"" Peter Berg's film pretends to dabble in a frothy moral ambiguity, swiftly betraying its true aims with trigger-happy jingoism.","38","1091191"
"2959","The first time I saw Yes Man, I thought the concept was getting kind of stale toward the end. As it turns out, that was only the trailer.","38","1068680"
"2960","This implausible action thriller also stars Julianne Moore as an FBI agent who sees Cage's two-bit Vegas act and decides he can single-handedly save the world.","38","435705"
"2961","As straight exploitation, it's amusing, in fits and starts. It's just that Colombiana lacks the kinetic energy of ""The Transporter"" and the pathos of ""La Femme Nikita.""","38","1657507"
"2962","Not all cartoon violence; there's cartoon nudity, too. Berry was paid a well-publicized $500,000 bonus to bare her breasts in the movie.","38","244244"
"2963","Annabelle is so lazily coat-tailing on Roman Polanski, they should have called it “Rosemary’s Barbie.”","38","3322940"
"2964","Instead, you get a nominal character study that boasts a single mighty performance and one nifty scene; alas, both performance and scene exist in a narrative vacuum - the plot is non-existent and the pace makes the ice age seem hasty.","38","105323"
"2965","How much of what we see in Third Person is the novelist's invention is part of the guessing game that goes on and on. And. On.","38","2343793"
"2966","Shamelessly exploits the horror of domestic violence for melodramatic, cheap thrills.","38","278435"
"2967","The Jackal, on the other hand, impressed me with its absurdity. There was scarcely a second I could take seriously.","38","119395"
"2968","Hallstrom and his low-heat stars can’t find the pulse of this corpse.","38","989757"
"2969","Hardcore Henry is jarring and so a-cinematic that I couldn’t enjoy much of the technical razzle-dazzle this ticking-clock monstrosity was hurling at me.","38","3072482"
"2970","Whether you're betting on action or laughs, this is a lose-lose scenario.","38","480255"
"2971","You don't want to look at anything else when Zeta-Jones is on-screen.","38","349903"
"2972","It seems endless. It's also unusually crude and stupid, even for an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie.","38","146675"
"2973","Cranked up at double speed, the plot of Flashdance could almost be a satirical fantasy about dance students. Although Flashdance doesn't admit it's a fantasy, neither does it succeed in looking realistic. [16 Apr 1983, p.E5]","38","85549"
"2974","Except for Kate Winslet's fearsome turn as a villain, the only terror Divergent roused in me was that the drag-ass thing would never end. Sorry, I'm a Candor.","38","1840309"
"2975","The film's as chaotic and heavy-handed as ""Summer of Sam"" without the same sense of harsh reality.","38","215545"
"2976","The movie deserves more stars for its bottom-line craft, but all the craft in the world can't redeem its story.","38","482606"
"2977","A lot more stupid action - and a lot less heart - than the character-driven original, as Stuart ends up rescuing Margalo from Falcon.","38","243585"
"2978","It's all very pat and, ultimately, annoying.","38","220506"
"2979","Zain Al Rafeea's naturalness, however uncanny, only makes the film's maneuverings seem all the more obvious.","38","8267604"
"2980","Art-directed within an inch of its life, Sleuth has the smirky gloss of a project that everyone involved with thinks is terribly good, and terribly clever. These people - Branagh, Pinter, Law and the usually great Caine (even in bad stuff) - are laboring under an epic misconception. Sleuth is just terrible.","38","857265"
"2981","Even for a horror movie, The Crazies is a bore, and we're talking about the most boring genre this side of dysfunctional-family indie drama.","38","455407"
"2982","Instead of using the titular metaphor as a means to seek deeper, darker ends, Isabel Coixet proceeds to restate it over and over again.","38","3062976"
"2983","Had the film version of Pet Sematary, adapted straightforwardly by King himself from the novel, and directed with horrifying ineptitude by Mary Lambert (Siesta), been any good, it would have been a sizzling shockeroonie, in that it deals, to borrow King's italicized style, with things best left undealt with, notably resurrected murderous children and the terrors instilled by terminal illness. [24 Apr 1989]","38","98084"
"2984","For a movie centered on brotherhood, it’s remarkably empty of any sense of kinship.","38","6017942"
"2985","The only hope for Inglourious Basterds is that audiences will embrace it the way the Broadway crowd did ""Springtime for Hitler"": because it's so bad they think it's good.","38","361748"
"2986","As a suspense film, it’s so sluggishly structured that it borders on the avant-garde.","38","6141246"
"2987","Overblown sanctimony and sentimentalism as corny as the Fourth of July.","38","187393"
"2988","The murderous Jason is back in the latest chapter of the most offensive series in film history, unless Burt Reynolds makes three more ``Smokey and the Bandit`` pictures real quick.","38","91080"
"2989","One of the dirtiest-minded mainstream releases in history. It has a low opinion of men, a lower opinion of women, and the lowest opinion of the intelligence of its audience. It is obscene, foulmouthed, scatological, creepy and perverted.","38","1488555"
"2990","Jammed with story threads that don’t cohere, Cirque commits the cardinal sin for a vampire movie: It’s bloodless.","38","450405"
"2991","The outtakes prove Analyze That could have been even worse.","38","289848"
"2992","The movie's own style is strictly an anti-style, all pre-packaged post-punk.","38","295701"
"2993","The movie pretty much exists to sell tie-in products, and it's about as entertaining as watching little kids playing with their toys in the sandbox.","38","453556"
"2994","Sitting through this movie is worse than being locked in a room with a continuous loop of ""Nip/Tuck"" playing on a jumbo screen.","38","1053424"
"2995","The horny teenagers all seem like banal, plastic, eager-to-please refugees from a sitcom, desperately hoping with their every line of dialogue for a canned laugh.","38","83972"
"2996","The film essentially indulges in the same act of willful distractedness as Ted Bundy’s admirers.","38","2481498"
"2997","For all of the film’s attempts to get back to the sinisterly sidling Michael of the first Halloween, his stealth movements no longer terrify because his fixations are less unthinkingly instinctual, more compulsively mortal.","38","1502407"
"2998","The intention is there, but the needed emotional maturity isn't.","38","118842"
"2999","McCarthy’s trademark blend of chipper likability and treble-voiced rage just isn’t quite enough to carry things through.","38","2702724"
"3000","Perhaps the strangest thing about 2012 is that the bad parts of the film are among the most enjoyable, because they're so over-the-top ridiculous that it's impossible not to break out laughing.","38","1190080"
"3001","The heroic irony that was hilarious in Raiders is merely ridiculous here, and the half-tribute/half-parody of the adventure genre is toyed with to threadbare extremes. [23 May 1984]","38","87469"
"3002","It’s a rare misstep for the usually sure-footed folks behind the Marvel Cinematic Universe.","38","3896198"
"3003","The pacing throughout is languid. Your eye becomes fixated on the hideous 70s wallpaper behind them. If only the story's interstellar narrative developments had the intensity of that wallpaper. Rod Serling might've gotten a great hour out of it (the story, that is, not the wallpaper). It simply is not two hours' worth, no matter how many quantum leaps into the unknown Kelly takes.","38","362478"
"3004","""We're in Twin Peaks here,"" says the only surviving teenager in town. It's a lame attempt to create class by association. Unlike David Lynch's kinky series, the creators of Freddy's Dead couldn't care less about the movie's interchangeable characters. The actors are often hard to tell apart; some are just worse than others. [14 Sept 1991, p.C5]","38","101917"
"3005","All this should build up to a moderately engaging battle of wits, but Richard Wenk's script has little interest in wit and no capacity for psychology.","38","455944"
"3006","Reign of Fire never comes close to recovering from its demented premise, but it does sustain an enjoyable level of ridiculousness.","38","253556"
"3007","The movie is going to make a lot of people mad, too - the ones who liked the book. If you missed Tom Wolfe's scathingly satirical best seller about the greedy society of the 1980s, you will probably find yourself bored by the tepid, badly miscast screen version. You may leave the theater a little confused as to why there was so much controversy during the filming of what turns out to be a silly, almost innocuous Hollywood farce. [21 Dec 1990, p.3F]","38","99165"
"3008","Trying to decipher all the convoluted pathways could drive you mad. Mostly, though, it is so ludicrous that it will unintentionally inspire laughter.","38","1401152"
"3009","What we have here is a witless attempt to merge the ""Twilight"" formula with the Michael Bay formula.","38","1464540"
"3010","Diesel’s ""Fast & Furious"" movies have heart. His ""Riddick"" movies have weirdness. His ""XXX"" entries have lunacy. (Can we pause to admire how many franchises this man has to his name?) Bloodshot, though, only offers mere generic mediocrity.","38","1634106"

"3014","Whereas a single, stinging one-liner would have sufficed Jacques Tourneur or Fritz Lang, Frank Miller's overcompensating flood of pulpy dialogue only renders his characters flat and sans empathy.","38","458481"
"3015","The new music helps, a little. But the movie is a karaoke act, re-creating the original movie’s story beats beat-by-beat-by-beat.","38","6105098"

"3018","What a bloody disappointment Stigmata is!","38","145531"
"3019","So hectically overdone in style that it already feels dated despite its timely leanings, Levinson’s film vaguely shelters a compelling story about today’s unforgiving online mob mentality beneath its convoluted layers.","38","6205872"
"3020","Wan wants to have something both ways, and in the end, he gets almost nothing. As Clint Eastwood said in yet another genre picture: A man’s gotta know his limitations.","38","804461"

"3023","It sounds like fun, but this quasi-continuation of the Nightmare on Elm Street series is a half-hour too long, running 112 minutes when less than 90 would suffice. [14 Oct 1994, p.4D]","38","111686"
"3024","Kevin Smith shows up briefly as a lab technician in the miserable Daredevil, and that's a pity. This is a movie that desperately needs the presence of Smith's trademark sidekicks Jay and Silent Bob, with Smith as Bob, ragging worse than ever on his old pal Ben Affleck.","38","287978"
"3025","Without a philosophical payoff, without characters whose relationships resonate in our hearts, without explanations for situations that beg for explanations, what are we left with? To quote another great writer of battle scenes: ""a tale full of sound and fury, told by an idiot, signifying -- nothing.""","38","242653"
"3026","A make-work project for generations of Hollywood women and female fashion celebrities, it is pristine in its visuals — mainly closeups of the Oscar winners and other great beauties of its cast precise in its caper — and utterly bloodless in execution.","38","5164214"
"3027","There's a girl, and she's prone to dirty acts, but that's just one patch of this arbitrarily stitched quilt of white-trash, Bible-Belt transgression, which flattens under the weight of a truckload of half-realized ambitions.","38","1107319"
"3028","A sour, plotless and witless comedy-drama based on the final Mordecai Richler novel, wants to remind you of ""Sideways"" and its forlorn drink-moistened soul search. Giamatti is an ideal casting choice, but even this talented actor can't sell a lovable-jerk","38","1423894"

"3030","""Star Trek VI"" is one of the weaker additions to the Enterprise enterprise. It merely goes through the motions, including requisite moments that feel obligatory and uninspired.

"3031","Marvel-man Mark Steven Johnson, who wrote and directed ""Daredevil"" (2003) and scripted ""Elektra"" (2005), continues to demonstrate the wrong way to make comic book movies: Make sure special effects overwhelm the characters, let campy mannerisms go unchecked and be sure dialogue is declaimed rather than spoken.","38","259324"

"3042","It’s fair if not entirely accurate to say everything funny it you can see in the trailers and TV ads for Why Him? Because those samples aren’t the least big amusing, and there is a random laugh or three in this holiday comedy to put the “R” back in Christmas.","38","4501244"

"3049","From narrative to character development to staging, every frame of Mistress America drips with artifice. It's a playground for unpleasant, self-absorbed characters - an excursion into the lifestyles of people most of us would prefer to bypass.

"3053","As a romance, Spanglish is like a wholesome flirt who drags things out and becomes a tiresome tease. As a satire of upper-middle-class Los Angeles, it's a disaster.","38","371246"
"3054","Less a movie than a checklist of indiecinema clichés. Youth on a journey of self-discovery? Got it. Dead mom? Uh-huh. Wounded and entitled when it’s trying to be soulful, plotless, laden with indie rock and entirely overhyped at Sundance? Checkarooney.","38","2179116"

"3062","John Gulager's directing debut is horror at its most reductive and least resonant.","38","426459"
"3063","But Skin Deep hasn't the energy level or the inventiveness to sustain the demands of sex farce. There's only one sight gag as funny, involving glow-in-the-dark prophylactics. There's also only one role that's sympathetic. As usual, it's the Julie Andrews role of long-suffering wife, played by Alyson Reed. One last complaint: In the guise of being unflinching about dancing on the edge of outrage, the film reveals a mean streak involving cruel things done to dogs. Skin Deep spends what seems like a lot of time living up to - or is it down to? - its name. [3 March 1989, p.47]","38","98343"

"3067","There are two movies in Superman III, one a witless and obvious and often cruel comic strip, the other a blithe and subtle and often amusing exercise in middle-brow camp. Not only do the two halves never come together, they are in active opposition. [17 June 1983]","38","86393"
"3068","Watching the movie made me long for the big , risky ideas and entertainingly fearless filmmaking in David O. Russell's ""I Heart Huckabees "" and Spike Jonze's ""Adaptation ,"" which Kaufman wrote. Both were similarly conceptual escapades, but they let it all hang out.","38","420223"

"3084","The action is fun. And the unintentional laughs from the plot lapses, check-writing and black-face — Did I mention how these two try to “pass” in Africa? — are almost worth devoting well-over two hours to The Whistleblower. Almost.","38","896872"
"3085","A borrowed idea -- hello, ""Blade Runner,"" hi there, ""Matrix"" -- but an idea nonetheless.","38","399201"
"3086","Strange Days, then, isn't nearly strange enough. Once the premise haslost its promise, and Fiennes's brave attempts at characterization aresacrificed to pseudo-dazzle, everything appears awfully humdrum and, yes,distinctly dated. So dated that in the crowded and pat climax, as the balldrops on the year 2000, all that's missing is Dick Clark himself - damn,it's out with the old and in with the older. [13 Oct 1995]","38","114558"
"3087","John Patrick Shanley's Joe Versus the Volcano starts out so brilliantly, so hilariously, so imaginatively, that even as it's cracking you up, you begin worrying that the rest of the film can't possibly be that good. Sure enough, it isn't. In fact, it deflates pretty alarmingly. But at least it has that beginning. [9 Mar 1990, p.27]","38","99892"

"3090","Gudegast, a first-time director who wrote the script to Den of Thieves (and who has probably watched Michael Mann's ""Heat"" more than once) attempts to comment on humanity's complexities.

"3091","Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson is the true Tower of Babel, the movie star who with each film gets closer to God and whose films always come tumbling down around him.","38","5758778"
"3092","It is now weighed down by a second half that's equal parts incoherent, tedious, and repetitive.","38","2226417"
"3093","There's very little plot in the movie, just an excursion through the growing pains of some very plastic characters. The script by Schumacher and Carl Kurlander is more a character outline than a screenplay because there simply isn't enough meat to flesh it out. [8 July 1985]","38","90060"
"3094","The manipulative Star Wars-style score is the only novelty on tap in Silverado, which has a plot too drearily complicated and arid to summarize and an attitude almost unbearable in its dryly smirky assurance that it knows what you want from a Western, which is to say, action that never quits, emotion that's never felt, characters that are never real and situations that are never sensible.

"3095","Only one-third of these gags are funny. [5 Dec 1989, p.C1]","38","97958"
"3096","The film reinforces only the most simplistic and patriotic vision of Churchill, its closed-off view of the man reminiscent of the many tracking shots that wind through the underground tunnels of the U.K.‘s war command, constantly peeking into rooms with classified meetings as doors are abruptly closed to keep them secret","38","4555426"

"3100","Instead of generating a testosterone rush, the fight scenes release tryptophan. Not only are they boring, but they are choreographed in an amateurish fashion.","38","351977"
"3101","This film isn't an enjoyable martial-arts extravaganza like ""District B-13"" or the ""Transporter"" films.","38","936501"
"3102","The film desperately needs a stronger script; one with a few funny jokes would be nice.","38","422774"
"3103","A movie like this is harmless, I suppose, except for the celluloid that was killed in the process of its manufacture, but as an entertainment, it will send the kids tiptoeing through the multiplex to sneak into ""Spider-Man 2.""","38","167456"
"3104","Gavin Hood relays a vague sense of what it's like to live in duty, and yet at a distance from one's home, but this vision of the future never rouses, never asks to be remembered.","38","1731141"
"3105","All of it makes for a rollicking, outsize tale of overweening ambition and palace intrigue, but J. Edgar instead plays it safe in a turgid, back-and-forth series of tableaux that look as if they were filmed from behind a scrim soaked in weak tea.","38","1616195"
"3106","A movie steeped in sin that squats awkwardly in a cinematic purgatory between tawdry and talky.","38","1423995"
"3107","Some of the players comport themselves better than others--Barrymore is sweetly wistful in her minor role, while Johansson, as a confident go-getter who sets out to steal her crush object rather than moon over him, is sexier than the whole cast put together.","38","1001508"
"3108","If Fleming had played everything as a black comedy with a satirical send-up of high school life - like Heathers - he might have had something. But The Craft has no consistency and certainly no art as it drifts into an unprepossessing display of special-effects magic. [03 May 1996, p.08]","38","115963"
"3109","Falls somewhere on that aesthetic scale between mediocre and flat-out bad.","38","417217"
"3110","The movie is a leaden, slow-moving beast.","38","363771"
"3111","It suggests the worst possible gene splice of a barbed Terrance and Phillip South Park appearance, Fargo's blithe condescension, and the smuggest of Quentin Tarantino pastiches.","38","3099498"
"3112","A tale of memory and redemption that does little to linger in the mind and even less to decry P.L. Travers's claim that Disney turns everything it touches into schmaltz.","38","2140373"
"3113","With such a bang-up cast, this setup could at least elicit some tears, but in its 107 minutes, nary a one welled up in my eyes.","38","327137"

"3117","Revolutionary Road isn't just a failed literary adaptation. It's a failure of the worst kind: It doesn't even make you want to read Richard Yates' deservedly legendary book.","38","959337"
"3118","Every serious narrative beat in the film is ultimately undercut by pro-forma storytelling, or by faux-improvised humor.","38","4154796"
"3119","Though Keaton is convincing as a smarmy narcissist who secretly thinks he deserves to fail because writing plays isn't REAL work, he's also thoroughly unlikable -- a problematic trait in a protagonist.","38","425055"
"3120","Lacks the heart that might otherwise have breathed life into the pointless shtick.","38","329028"
"3121","The money shots of the living tableau are padded with jokes that feel embalmed before the actors get them out of their mouths.","38","1078912"
"3122","Once again, we have a movie where the jokes are aimed at the least common denominator - meaning that to genuinely enjoy the experience of sitting through Slackers, you will need help from a controlled substance.","38","240900"
"3123","The title doesn't hint at the unsavory mess the film actually is.","38","259711"
"3124","Another tale of Tinseltown drugs, sex and excess - has transferred itself to the screen with mind-boggling, laugh-inciting horribleness.","38","865554"
"3125","A weak villain, a couple of eye-rollingly unlikely cons and dead stretches that make 105 minutes play like 145 and you've got Focus, the last dog of February, where comatose con job movies are released to the sounds of silence.","38","2381941"

"3128","It's hard to imagine anyone having the patience to sit through this movie except perhaps a handful of 11-year old boys seeking vicarious wish fulfillment.","38","449010"
"3129","Kubrick certainly doesn't fail small. One could fast forget The Shining as an overreaching, multi-levelled botch were it not for Jack Nicholson. Nicholson, one of the few actors capable of getting the audience to love him no matter what he does, is an ideal vehicle for Kubrick. [14 Jun 1980, p.E1]","38","81505"
"3130","The direction is similarly yearning; practically begging for admiration. A sequence in which Hemsworth swishes toward the camera, piece of pie in hand, grooving to the strains of Deep Purple’s Hush, is so desperate in its attempt to appear iconic that it becomes difficult to watch head-on.","38","6628394"
"3131","An unintentional high-tech hoot.","38","218817"

"3133","The idea may sound like fun, but the movie isn't. It's a travesty of a picture that's a disgrace to the memory of the great film from which it's remade. [5 February 1999, Friday, po.A]","38","120784"
"3134","I'll personally toast the buns of anybody I hear saying anything good about the movie Broadcast News. Broadcast News is for boobs. It doesn't apply to us. Anyone who thinks otherwise is invited not to think, because thinking is for statues. [16 Dec 1987, p.C5]","38","92699"
"3135","The sequel to the 2008 hit “Twilight” makes no effort to satisfy outsiders. It's strictly for devotees who won't balk at plot absurdities, clunky dialogue and patchy characterizations.","38","1259571"
"3136","A truly baffling late entry in the ""Pulp Fiction"" sweepstakes that ends up drowning in its own pretensions -- along with, quite possibly, what's left of Val Kilmer's movie career.","38","235737"
"3137","It's not as scary as it needs to be or as clever as it thinks it is, but the new 3D version of ""Piranha"" is at least as gimmicky as those fabled 3D films of yore. With all the pointless 3D cartoons and joyless 3D """"Clash of the Titans"" conversions, at last here's a picture that tosses its cookies, its coffee cups and its D-cups right in your lap.","38","464154"
"3138","Unbroken is a grueling endurance test - for the audience just as much as for its cutout champion.","38","1809398"

"3141","For a film that had once made some pretense toward exposing such dangerously submissive attitudes toward Hollywood romance, Friends with Benefits's conclusion can't help but seem more than a wee bit disingenuous.","38","1632708"
"3142","Speaking of afterthoughts, Olivia Wilde has a bit part as a single mom who unwittingly aids and abets the Brennans in their escape, and Brian Dennehy lurches silently through a number of scenes as John's working-class father. It's jarring to see such big-name actors in such thankless roles.","38","1458175"
"3143","A movie about death that stubbornly refuses to come to life.","38","119643"
"3144","Armie Hammer has given several of the worst performances in recent years — see, or rather don’t, “Mirror Mirror” and “J. Edgar.” The big surprise in The Man from U.N.C.L.E is that Henry Cavill is even worse.","38","1638355"
"3145","Almodovar lets his movie become boring, and insufferably so.","38","913425"
"3146","It unites a mélange of teen-film tropes into a narrative overburdened with cultural references and framing devices, and undermined by a lack of attention to character.","38","2582496"

"3149","Often divertingly colorful and busy to a fault, the film seems to dare us to mock the world of comics' most risible superhero.","38","1477834"
"3150","Jason Statham gives the best performance. Dolph Lundgren gets the best character arc. Terry Crews gets the best gun. Jet Li gets the best kill (you'll know it when you see it).Arnold Schwarzenegger gets the best cameo. And Sylvester Stallone? He gets the blame.","38","1320253"
"3151","Maud Lewis herself couldn’t paint a hurricane that would blow the film’s overburdened narrative off course.","38","3721954"
"3152","When Taylor Sheridan is left to his own devices, his work seems more abrupt and shallow, no more so than when he resolves all of this film's lingering questions in one unremittingly nasty sideswipe of a flashback.","38","5362988"
"3153","J.C. Chandor turns an intensely physical narrative into another of his inadvertently generic studies of procedure.","38","1488606"
"3154","We’re typically never trusted to accept the reality of an icon’s life for what it is rather than what media consultants want it to exemplify. What the film’s real failing amounts to is any lack of interest in Ginsburg’s true superpower: Her inhuman, sleepless drive to do the work.","39","4669788"
"3155","When he divides the screen into quadrants for his big finish, the effect is just laughable -- but then by that point, the movie is too.","39","1220198"
"3156","The film has brief flashes of believability and humor. By and large, though, the script is uninspired, the picture's characters are stick figures, its dialogue is lackluster and the star's performance seldom rises above the adequate.","40","298203"
"3157","Stanton has been given the resources to create an expansive, expensive world, but lacks the instincts to direct live-action, a limitation that shows most in the performances. Bare of chest and fair of feature, Kitsch doesn't exhibit enough charisma to carry a project of this scale.","40","401729"
"3158","I wouldn't call this 1960 picture one of Billy Wilder's best comedies—it's drab, sappy, and overlong at 125 minutes.","40","53604"

"3162","Although shot well and boasting some effective 3-D work, this is a woefully inadequate effort, and the series began to slip into inadvertent self-parody.","40","85750"
"3163","When Beatty and Hoffman doe their (deliberately hopeless) singing numbers, jerking like mechanical men, phrasing unmusically, going off-key, they don't have the slapstick skills for it. That's when you long for Martin and Murray, or some other comics. [1 June 1987, p.102]","40","93278"
"3164","Green Book warms the heart, then numbs the mind. It’s a broad-brush lesson in racism, a sermon on the power of empathy, a user’s guide to tolerance packaged as a mismatched-buddies comedy.","40","6966692"
"3165","Despite good moments and likable leads, this lacks both heart and humour in a confection that smacks of the over-familiar.","40","1041829"
"3166","As a rule, the filmmakers manufacture fake climaxes every 10 or 15 minutes, poop out and lapse into forgetfulness, just as if they were structuring the material for television. Norma Rae seems to reflect the confusion of veteran filmmakers so eager to please that they cease to think straight.","40","79638"
"3167","Timely but dreary and dramatically inept.","40","3322364"
"3168","Like hundreds of doomed movie protagonists before him, the hero of Life as a House doesn't have long to live. By the second reel, you may find yourself wishing his time on the planet was even shorter.","40","264796"
"3169","Infernally boring for much of its running time, and then, just as the pulse starts to quicken: To be continued.","40","383574"
"3170","Easily the most disappointing movie of the summer, Extract is more significantly the biggest letdown of its esteemed creator’s career.","40","1225822"
"3171","Elaborate as this sounds, there really isn't much plot here, only a parade of arbitrary visual tricks to hold the film together. [30 Mar 1988, p.C18]","40","94721"
"3172","Even at the low end of the Spielberg spectrum, there has always been some air of ingenuity, some sense of the maker's excitement. Not here. The Terminal plods in spirit and execution.","40","362227"
"3173","For a while, Leterrier does manage to conjure up a little bit of magic between all these charming actors. And then, presto: Just like that, it’s gone.","40","1670345"
"3174","Whedon and director Jean-Pierre Jeunet (""Delicatessen"") bend over so far backward to make Weaver's and Ryder's roles beefy that they end up mocking the characters' bravura.","40","118583"
"3175","Lambert is as uncharismatic as ever, while Van Peebles is as frightening as a wrestler in mock angry mood, and just as ridiculous. To Morahan's credit, however, he smoothly continues the series' tradition of flashy images, showy sfx, aerial landscape shots and driving rock tunes.","40","110027"
"3176","Predators tries to spice up the hunt-or-be-hunted thesis, but from the get-go, director Nimrod Antal's movie has nowhere to run.","40","1424381"
"3177","It's not enough to have the characters act scared and then to throw in a bunch of special effects. It's absolutely essential to creep out the audience, and that's what De Bont neglects to do. [23 July 1999, p.17]","40","171363"
"3178","Try as they might, Nicole and Milo, as they are called in the movie, don't steam. Wispy vapors is about as good as it gets.","40","1038919"
"3179","Charm, alas, is the one thing lost in all the banging and clanging of the remake.","40","800320"
"3180","A competent suspenser, helped by the always-dependable Diane Lane, but it suffers by following the modern thriller playbook to the letter.","40","880578"
"3181","Shrek isn't clever or smart. It just wants you to think it is, through wink after wink after wink.","40","126029"
"3182","The movie is vile and brutalizing. Indeed, in many ways it is worse than the book. If The Exorcist had been invested with any real intelligence or passion, if it had wanted to do something other than promote a few shivers, the explicitness would never have mattered. As used here, the explicitness amounts to not much more than a shill, a come-on.","40","70047"
"3183","The verite of this saga of Generation X is that it is no more fierce than a peck. ""Reality Bites"" begins as a promising and eccentric tale of contemporary youth but evolves into a banal love story as predictable as any lush Hollywood affair.","40","110950"
"3184","This disappointing sequel to last year's horror sleeper gets trapped in the clichés it's trying to send up.","40","120082"
"3185","Like watching a statue for two-and-a-half hours, there’s nothing to do but sit back and yawn.","40","6924650"
"3186","Then there's the utter lack of sexual chemistry between Li and Aaliyah, sucking all the urgency out of the relationship between the star-crossed lovers.","40","165929"
"3187","Neither the film’s main players nor its random period spoofery has any personality.","40","762125"
"3188","Even if there were a great movie here, it would have been undermined by two lead actors who are barely even there, asked to deliver lines they can't handle: Bale, playing the Batman with clipped wings, and Katie Holmes as an assistant district attorney who doesn't have the gravitas to pass as an intern. Come back, Alicia Silverstone; all is forgiven.","40","372784"
"3189","You can't get close to Bennett — not because he's a morally ambiguous character, as the movie would have you believe, but because he never puts anything on the table. He struts through every consequence, a man with nothing to lose because he never had anything worth losing in the first place.","40","2039393"
"3190","The voice work sounds more quick-paycheck than impassioned, and the animation rarely rises above video-game cut-scene quality. As revisionist holiday fables go, you're better off watching Aardman's delightful ""Arthur Christmas"" than this lump of coal.","40","1446192"
"3191","Trapped in a no man's land between seriousness and pulp trash, it plays like a combination of ""Death Wish"" and ""The Hours."" If that sounds like an awkward fit, it is.","40","476964"
"3192","Although assembled with consummate care and obsessive attention to visual detail, Pacific Rim manages only fitful engagement and little in the way of real wonderment, suspense or terror.","40","1663662"
"3193","Writer-director Jill Sprecher doesn't have the deftness or sad humour that P. T. Anderson uses in his similarly contrived group portraits, but the cast are, at least, individually fine.","40","268690"
"3194","Kidman is able to draw you in even as the movie's solemn, morbid obviousness wears you out.","40","935075"
"3195","The fourth best virtual reality film of 1999. The best is ""The Matrix"". The second best is ""eXistenZ"". The third best, well, there's got to be something better than this.","40","139809"
"3196","Despite her underwritten character, Mathis easily takes top acting honors with equal parts toughness and tenderness.","40","108327"
"3197","Too bad the plot held no surprises and the acting no revelations. No actor could be said to stand out and the movie never acquires much tension or momentum.","40","418819"
"3198","The problem, I think, comes back to Mr. Stallone. Throughout the movie we are asked to believe that his Rocky is compassionate, interesting, even heroic, though the character we see is simply an unconvincing actor imitating a lug.","40","75148"
"3199","Little kids will be bored, as there are only a few scenes with any action, and of those, only one, featuring an enormous skeleton with swords sticking out of its skull, has any oomph.","40","4302938"
"3200","The big surprise is so obvious that it makes the deliberate pacing seem painfully slow, and Kidman's prissy accent and tight-lipped performance are more than a little grating.","40","230600"
"3201","This inane and incredibly tasteless sequel qualifies as an excuse to bring back those hard-working funnymen Jason Bateman, Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis for another round of amateur-criminal hijinks and semi-improvised vulgarity, jabbing away repeatedly at some elusive comic sweet spot where blatant nastiness and egregious stupidity collide — and very occasionally hitting the mark.","40","2170439"
"3202","Buried deep inside this ponderous, repetitive psychological thriller is a fantastic half-hour ""Twilight Zone"" episode.","40","167404"
"3203","These catacombs are just an echo chamber into which any rubbish can be pumped, and while this gives carte blanche to production designer Louise Marzaroli, the relentless flow of subterranean non-sequitur becomes at least as trying as the whirling, jerky non-cinematography.","40","2870612"
"3204","Joy is joyless.","40","2446980"
"3205","Mr. Blake's screenplay and Mr. Costner's direction of it are, with the exception of three memorable sequences, commonplace. The film is painstakingly composed of small details of frontier and tribal life that should be riveting. Most of the time they aren't.","40","99348"
"3206","A disappointing sequel to Clive Barker's innovatory body horror pic, which - while making some effort to flesh out the Cenobite mythology - simply performs cosmetic surgery on the original.","40","95294"
"3207","Mostly, this is the cinematic equivalent of a first-person shooter game, one where the Marines possess only slightly more personality than the faceless invaders.","40","1217613"
"3208","Townsend and Aaliyah are sexy as hell, and clearly willing and able to explore the darker truths of villainy, but they can't compete against the unwieldy script.","40","238546"
"3209","Episodically eventful but utterly unsuspenseful, the film is a diversion that requires little attention and satisfies the film-going needs of a wide variety of viewers.","40","120738"
"3210","Falls into the category of the contrived and forgettable cop drama.","40","498399"
"3211","Give this literally and figuratively bloodless spooker a pass.","40","5690360"
"3212","The film's real star is its magnificent set (filmed and constructed in Malta), though Williams manages to screw up his face and eye in a credible imitation of the drawings, and Duvall is perfect as the gangly Olive Oyl.","40","81353"
"3213","Jolie must eventually become a comic-book supergirl impervious to explosions and bullets, all the better to set up a ""Bourne""-like franchise by the final fade-out.","40","944835"
"3214","The razzle-dazzle can't distract from the monotonously overstuffed spy-film plot.","40","1216475"
"3215","Comes straight out of the Forrest Gump School of Interpersonal Magic, and that's not necessarily a good thing.","40","140397"
"3216","A werewolf movie masquerading as a thriller, it looks like a canny attempt by Bruce A. Evans, its director and screenwriter (with Raynold Gideon), to establish a ""Saw""-like franchise using the names of fading ’80s stars to lend the project a semblance of respectability.","40","780571"
"3217","Separately the characters are annoying; together it’s unnervingly like watching one actress playing twins.","40","363282"
"3218","Reitman, who also cowrote the screenplay, feels the constant need to ""deepen"" his characters, granting them wants and motivations--especially during the moralistic third act--that are totally alien to how they're initially portrayed.","40","1193138"
"3219","Most of Mask's cast and crew return, but they forgot to bring the last film's romantic aura and dry sense of humor with them; Anthony Hopkins is deeply missed. Instead, the picture is beset by typical sequel problems like awkward slapstick and allegedly adorable kid sidekicks.","40","386140"
"3220","Though Helen Slater makes a bad first impression, she's not a bad Supergirl by the end, being likably straightforward, guileless and sweet. And unlike Reeve, who looks exactly the same whether he's Clark Kent or Superman, Slater makes you believe that people wouldn't know brunette Linda Lee was actually blond Supergirl. That may not be a major cinematic achievement, but it's about the best that Supergirl has to offer. [26 Nov 1984, p.119]","40","88206"
"3221","Off the dance floor, however, Black Swan is trashy and incoherent. Aronofsky, for all his gifts, is a gaudy maestro, opportunistic and insecure as an artist.","40","947798"
"3222","A great film about the American civil rights movement is way overdue. The Butler, overwhelmed by flash and good intentions, doesn't even come close.","40","1327773"
"3223","Nothing comes together after the first ten minutes.","40","432291"
"3224","'Oh Lord', says the preacher in a suitably grave voice, 'do we have the strength to carry out this task in one night, or are we just jerking off?' Maybe Mel Brooks should have asked himself that question about this movie.","40","71230"
"3225","Mitchell’s third film feels like a script that was locked in a drawer after numerous rejections but now can be brought out and pushed through with clout earned from the success of It Follows.","40","5691670"
"3226","Funny People is an ambitious, misshapen picture that feels like two, maybe even three, separate movies uncomfortably jammed into one.","40","1201167"
"3227","The result isn't deadly dull, but it does turn what should have been a most dangerous game into a basic scenery-chewing contest.","40","971209"
"3228","You’re going to find it all either enormously empowering or deeply calculated: an Arcade Fire–scored TV commercial for instant spirituality.","40","359950"
"3229","Alas, it's too coarsely drawn and broadly directed by Brit Jonathan Lynn to effectively skewer what ought to have been an easy target.","40","104114"
"3230","These bantering would-be heroes mostly live at the tops of their voices.","40","163579"
"3231","The director, Taylor Hackford, never makes any of this pop, which isn’t a surprise given the material.","40","1967614"
"3232","There’s a stern, let’s-get-to-work air to the film’s craft and conception that hampers whatever thrill of the chase “Inferno” has to offer. Fundamentally silly the film may be, but it never graduates to spryness.","40","3062096"
"3233","The movie provides a fair number of laughs, even if you can't help wondering how many of them were actually intentional.","40","118615"
"3234","It's charmingly bad and an excellent date film.","40","120888"
"3235","Director Ted Kotcheff has all sorts of trouble with this mess, aside from credibility. Supposedly, the real villain here is society itself, which invented a debacle like Vietnam and must now deal with its lingering tragedies. But First Blood cops out completely on that one, not even trying to find a solution to Stallone's problems.","40","83944"
"3236","What comes before and after the sound and fury of the bombing raid are reams of banal dialogue.","40","213149"
"3237","Jackson bears the weight of the film in a constrained, introverted role (terrorised, pertinacious, innocent passion squandered), but a grand resolution and some melodramatic twists and set-pieces undercut the hard-nosed tone.","40","118531"
"3238","This 1998 romantic comedy mostly bores with its cumbersome exposition and close-ups of trivial objects scattered throughout lackluster montage sequences.","40","120783"
"3239","It's not much fun to watch.","40","120812"
"3240","Much of the problem lies with Howell, a dilute, rabbity actor in the Tim Hutton mold. Everyone acts Howell off the screen, including Jennifer Jason Leigh, who displays an easeful gruffness as the girl who joins Jim. With Howell's weightlessness, the deeper elements of the story -- the byplay between guilt and innocence, for example -- never accumulate.","40","91209"
"3241","The only remarkable thing about Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather, Part II is the insistent manner in which it recalls how much better his original film was...Even if Part II were a lot more cohesive, revealing, and exciting than it is, it probably would have run the risk of appearing to be the self-parody it now seems.","40","71562"
"3242","If ""Wedding Crashers"" is in your top ten rom-coms ever, you might not hate this. Otherwise, it’s too gross to be sweet and too sweet to be gross.","40","452625"
"3243","A dispiritingly vitriolic, only sporadically funny satire of ’50s Hollywood, Hail, Caesar! verifies a suspicion long held here, that the Coen brothers, Joel and Ethan, really hate the movies.","40","475290"
"3244","Like a beautifully tailored suit that starts to smell funny after a few minutes, this sumptuous but stultifying lark sets up a quasi-Hitchcockian intrigue between two strangers abroad, but smothers any thrills or sparks in a haze of self-regard.","40","1243957"
"3245","Ultimately, the film amounts to little more than a consummate study of suspense technique, all dressed up with nowhere to go.","40","80661"
"3246","The draggiest of the Crosby holiday vehicles. Even the usually manic Danny Kaye is reduced to a kind of nagging Man Friday. There are some good tunes, though (Berlin was in on this one, too). [19 Dec 1991, p.12]","40","47673"
"3247","By and large, the jokes fall flat, and the entire film often seems as fatigued as its star.","40","359013"
"3248","At isolated moments a tolerably amusing send-up of alien invasion disaster movies in which the attackers are video arcade-era renegades arrived to gobble up as many famous landmarks as possible, this one-note comedy runs out of gas within an hour (it is based on a short film) and should have been trimmed to a neat 90 minutes.","40","2120120"
"3249","I, Tonya too often feels glib and glancing, holding the public responsible for many of the easy assumptions and narrative shortcuts the film itself indulges in while telling Harding’s story.","40","5580036"
"3250","The credits had just started and I was already looking for a barf bag.","40","166943"
"3251","Spunky yet maudlin, grim yet heartwarming, the movie—written by Mooney and Kevin Costello—is mainly a batch of hollow gestures.","40","5805752"
"3252","Instead of developing the story’s wartime context, Trueba and veteran screenwriter Jean-Claude Carrière offer passing reflections on the relationship between observation and the largely mental process of creativity, but little that ignites genuine drama.","40","1990217"
"3253","As impressive as these visual elements prove to be, the film struggles to grab and maintain audiences’ interest, whether or not they know the underlying legend by heart.","40","1335975"
"3254","More Pistachio Disguisey than Austin Powers, this cheapjack comedy is nowhere near as ingenious as the man it sends up.","40","1470023"
"3255","Mostly this film skims by on the surface, its conflict and climax visible from the opening five minutes.","40","181984"
"3256","It tries to be both camp and action film--send-up and kick-ass. But it delivers so little on both fronts.","40","160127"
"3257","Like a date who's primped too long to arrive at dinner with something to talk about, Road to Perdition is beautifully groomed and a perfect drag to be with.","40","257044"
"3258","A very vulgar pro-faith comedy rather than a sacrilegious goof, Dogma is an extraordinarily uneven film.","40","120655"
"3259","Tim Burton's new movie is gorgeous -- shot by shot it may be the most impressive thing he's done.","40","162661"
"3260","The movie’s disappointingly straightforward, with no discernible flair.","40","119008"
"3261","This is state-of-the-art stuff, and clearly Landis is as proud of it as those kid prodigies who build computers out of Q-Tips. Landis also out-palms Brian De Palma, not only giving you nightmares about massacres but double nightmares that go on to meta-massacres just when you think they're over. But despite all of this super-sophistication the movie is finally just as silly as the old horror pictures it ambiguously kids. There's nothing like a rotting, wisecracking corpse to embody the bubble-gum nihilism of the Wise-Guy Wave. [7 Sept 1981, p.82]","40","82010"
"3262","Solid 007 entertainment -- not as bad as some of the recent Bonds but not as spunky as some of the series' originals.","40","143145"
"3263","Though Crawford's bangs and facial hair are the most art-directed aspect of the movie, he's costumed to look like a member of the Trenchcoat Mafia (Madison Avenue branch).","40","1407084"
"3264","The main problem here is the gross inferiority of the new version to the old: compare Tracy's handling of the opening monologue with Martin's and you'll get a fair indication of what's become of commercial filmmaking over the past four decades.","40","101862"
"3265","Suburbicon is too lightweight and mannered; it lacks proper fury. Watching it is like having your trouser-leg savaged by an energetic small dog.","40","491175"
"3266","It's not boring (given the subject, how could it be?), but almost nothing in it works.","40","139134"
"3267","An uneven tone and the feeling of too many cooks mars the finished product, but there are moments of beauty and real terror.","40","780653"
"3268","An all-time low for the Enterprise and her crew, with Spock dead, the ship condemned, and everyone else looking about 104. Decent SFX, but a little more action wouldn't have gone amiss.","40","88170"
"3269","This material cant help but be interesting, even compelling up to a point, but its prosaic presentation suggests that the story's full potential, encompassing deep, disturbing and enduring pain on all sides of the issue, has only begun to be touched.","40","1895587"
"3270","Phony choppers and a startling resemblance to Jon Voight aren't enough to transform Theron into Wuornos, and I didn't buy either the performance or the character for a second.","40","340855"
"3271","There's nothing terribly wrong with Kate & Leopold -- it's just an awfully conventional upmarket romantic comedy.","40","35423"
"3272","Safe House devolves into unexciting action scenes that feel left over from the ""Bourne"" flicks and are peopled with cloak-and-dagger stereotypes.","40","1599348"
"3273","Amiable fluff that takes its time learning how to walk, talk, and generally act like the kid-centric rom-com that it is.","40","889573"
"3274","It is made by a Morrison groupie for other groupies, a film that leaves the rest of us locked outside wondering what the fuss is about.","40","101761"
"3275","Clearly, director Nolan is aiming for something else. But the delight in sheer gamesmanship that marked his breakout ""Memento"" doesn't survive this project's gimmickry and aspirations toward ""Les Miserables""-style epic passion.","40","482571"
"3276","A broad, braying yuk fest that revels in coarse jokes, lacks the courage of its own cynicism (things keep wavering into sentimentality) and refuses to develop its own premise.","40","266452"
"3277","Ultimately the movie disintegrates due to its own clumsiness. It's far too coincidence-driven to be believable.","40","118636"
"3278","Despite the movie's title and Bening's central role, women are oddly peripheral.","40","4385888"
"3279","Mamet is so in love with the con that he's conned himself.","40","252503"
"3280","The premise cries out for take-no-prisoners, Terry-Southern-style sick humor; it gets instead a lot of clunky, self-congratulatory in-jokes, and Pacino is left to ham in a vacuum.","40","258153"
"3281","Tim Burton is all grown up and getting serious with this wildly scattershot tale.","40","319061"
"3282","The only genuine surprises on hand are the few moments when the film defies the expectations that have been programmed into our collective neurons by the past 25 years of horror movies.","40","139414"
"3283","Not till the very end of the film, when King Richard pops up, portrayed, in a surprise appearance, by an actor who has launched many a grand movie adventure, will audiences get a glimpse of epic star quality. Then, like the Merry Men, they will unleash a hearty ho-ho. The rest of this Robin Hood merits only a ho-hum.","40","102798"
"3284","Zinnemann blows it most of all in the Fonda-Redgrave relationship, and no credibility is given to Hellman's ferocious talent and dominant personality.","40","76245"
"3285","Revenge may be a dish best served cold, but Argentine writer-director Damián Szifron allows it to sit until it congeals in the dreary six-part anthology Wild Tales.","40","3011894"
"3286","Copycat, directed by Jon Amiel (""The Singing Detective"", ""Sommersby""), means to be a Greatest Hits album of atrocities. A sick mind is a terrible thing to waste. [13 Nov 1995, pg.120]","40","112722"
"3287","A grim, sour Jim Carrey comedy that erases the boundary between anarchic humor and sociopathic malice.","40","115798"
"3288","Clumsy and irritating.","40","31679"
"3289","It's an unholy mess, simultaneously too Gothic and too sarcastic, that preaches liberation and delivers only puritanism. It's a craftsmanlike but robotic imitation of ""interesting"" filmmaking, only in patches, and by accident, the real thing.","40","404203"
"3290","But we don't go to movies like this in search of stylish apercus. We go to see innocents like ourselves getting swept up by irresistible tides of terror. And to have the pants scared off us. That doesn't happen in The Pelican Brief.","40","107798"
"3291","A movie that's barely there. The McKenzies are genial enough, and once in a while they're vaguely funny. But their film is so ephemeral that you may hardly be aware of watching it, even while it's going on.","40","86373"
"3292","The ingredients were there for Confessions of a Dangerous Mind to become a cult classic, but the resulting film is a tedious Hollywood yawner.","40","270288"
"3293","Sparse and implausible screenplay.","40","161081"
"3294","The result falls squarely in familiar territory, better acted and better lit, perhaps, but more inauthentically melodramatic than ever.","40","1405500"
"3295","Such folks as delight in murder stories for their academic elegance alone should find this one steadily diverting, despite its monotonous pace and length...But the very toughness of the picture is also the weakness of its core, and the academic nature of its plotting limits its general appeal.","40","36775"
"3296","Feels at once secondhand in its eagerness and unknowing in its scorn.","40","1092026"
"3297","The most impressive thing about it is that the actors manage to sound so earnest while mouthing the most shameless cliches imaginable.","40","120686"

"3301","I had some trouble with the plot, but I'm not the only one -- so did the screenwriter.","40","372183"
"3302","A mish-mash of special effects, tasteless comedy and pointless action.","40","120891"
"3303","The double crosses are so intricate and the cynicism so enveloping that it becomes increasingly difficult to care about the characters","40","100150"
"3304","It's big, cartoonish and empty, with an interesting premise that is underdeveloped and overproduced. [3 July 1985, p.Calendar 6]","40","88763"
"3305","Raucous but fatally confused, openly pilfering its central themes from Gilliam’s own 1985 masterpiece Brazil, but with no idea how to develop them.","40","2333804"

"3308","The emotional connective tissue that made Lee’s film so poetic, romantic, tragic and thrilling is missing here, reducing Sword of Destiny to a series of loosely related fight sequences and gauzy, overwrought flashbacks.","40","2652118"
"3309","A load of formulaic nonsense that should still turn a few young heads thanks to its fantasy plot and Jesse Metcalfe's chest","40","455967"
"3310","All of this is silly, borderline senseless, lively, and without any real rooting value at all. The supposedly lovable misfits here aren’t, no matter how the cast members feign hilarity at their potty-mouthing. Not that it matters — because nothing does in this expensive toy of a film, which ultimately works on the level of a disco ball. It’s shiny, it moves, and is accompanied by much noise.","40","3829266"
"3311","As much as these actors heroically struggle to focus the film, the director more successfully hacks it apart. But if you really love Westerns, despite its faults, it's got to be recommended for Kilmer's performance alone.","40","108358"
"3312","It's take-the-money-and-run filmmaking, with the actors practically winking their dialogue at each other, and it's all supposed to be tongue-in-cheek fun. It isn't.","40","122151"
"3313","The few isolated funny moments, particularly a witty visual gag involving a pop-up tent with legs, provide only a short break from the screen-flooding onslaught of CGI creatures and screaming extras.","40","271367"
"3314","This is what makes Anderson's film so infuriating. It's so damned irresistible -- until it becomes so damned insufferable, getting lost in a marijuana fog of poorly explained plot developments and indecipherable twists. Still, it's hard to look away for fear of missing some other equally inspired flourish.","40","1791528"
"3315","The Accountant uses a cliched and misleading presentation of disability to produce a cliched Hollywood action lead in a cliched action plot, and then babbles cliches about the importance of embracing difference. Despite its protestations to the contrary, the only thing that sets The Accountant apart from its peers is its irritating, clueless hypocrisy, and its lousy title.","40","2140479"

"3322","The revulsion that Steven Spielberg maintained to the end of ""Saving Private Ryan"" is nowhere in sight — Ayer betrays his own values with a climax that’s like a hack gamer’s recreation of Peckinpah’s ""The Wild Bunch."" The final encounter between Ellison and a German soldier is meant to offer humanist balance, but in context it’s ludicrous. You can’t believe Ayer thought he could get away with it.","40","2713180"

"3325","A lot was left behind in this depthless account of a disaffected ghostwriter who wanted to affirm her artistic gift, freely and publicly. She actually did it with bravery and conviction, but this film doesn’t do her justice. Hence, my suggestion is: save your ticket money and read Colette’s biography instead.","40","5437928"

"3338","Nourizadeh and Landis are clearly going for a Tarantino level of blood-soaked dark humor, and while their cast is game, the film’s bursts of violence grow tiresome as its plot gets more and more ludicrous and hard to swallow.","40","3316948"
"3339","Even with its latter-day (modified) frankness, Far From Heaven is only thin glamour that lacks a tacit wry base. Thus diminished, it can be tagged with a term that Susan Sontag once defined so well that she put it out of circulation: camp.","40","297884"
"3340","The problem with the script by Susser and David Michod, working from a story by Brian Charles Frank, is that Hesher's uncouth behavior is so aggressively pushed to single-minded, crudely exploitative effect.","40","1403177"
"3341","The story is impenetrable, with more betrayals than you can give a damn about, and the frigid tone borders on self-parody, with frequent excursions to the wrong side of the border.

"3343","Under the direction of ""Die Harder's"" Renny Harlin, the movie has a crackling pace and a glossy look. It's all the more pernicious for that, this slick glorification of hate and loathing that portrays women as sexually promiscuous and men as infantile, violent and feeble-minded. Here's one Ford that doesn't have a better idea.","40","98987"
"3344","A derivative horror picture that somehow rises to the level of a primal scream. The premise is simple, by which I mean both easy to understand and feeble-minded.","40","884328"
"3345","A shambling, ponderous mess that aims to be a trashy cult classic and merely ends up in the trash - Fichtner aside. And, in the biggest disappointment of all, there's not even that much angry driving in it.","40","1502404"

"3350","Lone Scherfig directs it all as if it were a breezy lark, so a third-act tonal shift makes for an incongruous, excessively moralistic fit with everything that’s preceded. Most insulting, though, is the way in which the climactic passages miraculously tidy up every frayed edge of Jenny’s life.","40","1174732"
"3351","Crawl has no pretense and not very much range; it’s “Jaws” set in an old dark house.","40","8364368"
"3352","Contrived, shallow, distasteful, and ultimately pointless, BODY DOUBLE is more an exercise in empty cinematic style than an engrossing thriller. Although cinematographer Burum executes some absolutely breathtaking camera moves, his effort goes for naught when pitted against director De Palma and cowriter Avrech's insipid narrative. What De Palma has done here is simply take elements from two superb Alfred Hitchcock films, REAR WINDOW and VERTIGO, and combine them into one insipid film. While Griffith is sexy and appealing in her role, Wasson's character is so bland that he generates little interest.","40","86984"
"3353","Anyone old enough to have a license is probably much too old to be amused by License to Drive. Though the plot and action never get better than a television movie of the week, the engaging cast brings much more style to the material than it deserves. [06 July 1988, p.C17]","40","95519"
"3354","Never Look Away is not without ambition and reach, and there is a real storytelling impulse. But the central performance of Schilling looks shruggingly uncertain, as if he is bemused by what is going on.","40","5311542"
"3355","But this movie is no more interested in Cleveland than it is, really, in baseball: It doesn't have the passion for the sport's curiosities that Bull Durham has, nor the feeling for the sport's heartbreak of Eight Men Out. Watching Major League may be better than watching no baseball at all. But its place in the annals of baseball-moviedom is bush league at best.","40","97815"
"3356","Instead of just being desperately heartfelt, Her keeps reminding us — through cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema's somber-droll camera work, through Phoenix's artfully slumped shoulders — how desperately heartfelt it is.","40","1798709"
"3357","The movie's one unalloyed pleasure is a funny Goth Girl, played by Melissa McCarthy, who grasps, as Parker apparently doesn't, that the script is energetic rubbish, not The Greatest Story Ever Told.","40","289992"
"3358","Jovovich isn't at her best, but that's mainly because her character is required to be in shock most of the movie, except when she remembers that she's a Charlie's Angel, or happily sheds clothing to maintain that R-rating. Frankly, most of us can live with that.","40","120804"
"3359","Scenes come and go with a weightlessness that has nothing to do with zero gravity.","40","2935510"
"3360","The leaps made by Scott's agile mind in identifying both victim and usurper leave logic and credence on the starting block.","40","80516"
"3361","A curiously sour movie in its amused contempt for this fatuous family laced with affectionate nostalgia for its unshakable slickness and insularity, but also an undeniably strange one in its adoption of TV formats and cliches, as if these were the only indexes of contemporary reality that we have left.","40","112572"
"3362","If auds swallow this odoriferous exercise in calculated career repositioning, they'll swallow anything.","40","395699"
"3363","The film's two saving graces are the time machine itself -- a gorgeous, whirling array of burnished copper and blazing light -- and the CGI-created rise and fall of New York City.","40","268695"
"3364","Suffers from being neither here nor there. In its rush to modernize its story and attract a young audience with stars like Ethan Hawke and Gwyneth Paltrow, the film ends up problematic both in relation to the original and on its own terms.","40","119223"
"3365","Had Payne the grace or generosity to present the vulgarity and naiveté and tackiness of these characters as something vital and endearing and delightful, the movie might have been explosively funny.","40","257360"
"3366","There are not only glancing moments but whole sequences in this movie when the agony of social embarrassment makes you want to haul the characters to their feet and slap them in the chops.","40","842926"
"3367","Is the film worthy of her? Not really. It’s informative, in a didactic way, but basically an exercise in hagiography, a skin-deep celebration of someone who has never settled for superficiality in her life’s work.","40","4669788"
"3368","This wan rebooting of the Christ tale has decent acting, serviceable if familiar visual effects, a few jump-in-your-seat moments, and the always crowd-pleasing gimmick of a senior citizen cussing up a storm. But the down time between action scenes is deadly dull and the film's hoary cinematic shorthand (i.e., a young Black man enters the film to the sound of hip-hop and fights with his baby mama) is more terrifying than anything else served up.","40","1038686"
"3369","Though director Guy Hamilton has tried to make the Christie formula more cinematic by trimming the number of characters and streamlining the plot, the picture is still rather uninteresting. Only the performances, the lovely location, and some Cole Porter tunes make it worth watching.","40","83908"
"3370","But this whore-and-the-innocent friendship, set in Shanghai during the 1930s, is too trite to pull us in. And the gangster scenario around it (Bi Feiyu wrote the script) is similarly unconvincing.","40","115012"
"3371","Curtis's heart is in the right place. In fact, it's all over the place – front and centre and backlighting the whole thing with a benevolent glow. But it is hard not to watch this, read the news that it will probably be his last as a director, and look to the future.","40","2194499"
"3372","This movie starts from a premise so sociologically batty it’s hard to take any of its subsequent terrors seriously, which means tension doesn’t so much fly out the window as fail to even get up the driveway.","40","2184339"
"3373","Speaking of jail, ""Shawshank""-the-movie seems to last about half a life sentence. The story, chiefly about the 20-year friendship between Freeman and Robbins, becomes incarcerated in its own labyrinthine sentimentality.","40","111161"
"3374","Despite a glut of luridness, the story line feels essentially flat, as Keitel stumbles through New York in an immoral, unchanging haze. It is only the strength of Keitel's performance that gives his personality human dimension.","40","103759"
"3375","Nicholson's Joker will be the pivotal point for many. It's his energy, spurting like an artery, that keeps the picture alive; it's certainly not the special effects, the editing, which has no discernible rhythm, or the flaccid screenplay.","40","96895"
"3376","Crichton's adaptation of his own novel falls badly between genres, never quite making up its mind whether it's aiming for comedy or suspense, and not succeeding very conclusively at either. The characters stay largely undeveloped, while - despite superficially peculiar features - the robbery is stripped of the ingenious exposition of the novel to become just another heist.","40","79240"
"3377","Flat and thoroughly predictable piece of filmmaking.","40","228750"
"3378","Hoffman predictably knocks a familiar role out of the park (and just as unsurprisingly, wrings excellence from his performers) in this rather trivial, downbeat four-hander about a working-class couple trying to connect during a Gotham winter.","40","1278379"
"3379","The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a perfect fit for its target audience – the Harry Potter kids who are following Emma Watson through her baby steps towards the stronger stuff.","40","1659337"
"3380","It's an action junkie's angry fix -- 130 minutes of sound and fury, signifying nothing but big bucks and boundless contempt for viewer intelligence.","40","117500"
"3381","The film is repetitive and not as suspenseful at it tries to be. Often gorgeous, sometimes fascinating, it is ultimately unwieldy and unsurprising. It fails as a Smith-family project. Jaden Smith, who was fine in ""The Karate Kid,"" is flat here.","40","1815862"
"3382","John Hughes didn't have an idea for a summer film this year, but he went ahead and made one anyway. The Great Outdoors, Hughes' latest extrusion from his script factory, has almost nothing to recommend it, save a lovely performance by John Candy, one of the most likable actors anywhere. Candy is untouchable; when the film is good, you want to see more of him, because he's mostly the reason. When the film is not so good (which is often), you don't blame him. [17 June 1988, p.7]","40","95253"
"3383","An overextended, episodic disappointment.","40","120102"
"3384","If its juxtaposition of bad behavior and dairy products leaves you stone-faced or wearily sighing, you should exit the theater posthaste.","40","1349451"
"3385","A coercive script by James Kearns, and some middling direction by Nick Cassavetes, can't rob the movie of an undeniable, headlong crowd-pleasing power.","40","251160"
"3386","Fleetingly enjoyable in very short bursts, this is the most cynically constructed event movie in recent memory, its heart purely in its wallet. A fantastic bore.","40","120667"
"3387","The Meg proves only that, at least cinematically speaking, great-white movies may have finally jumped the shark.","40","4779682"
"3388","Ultimately, the coiffure competition serves as a gaudy, cheerful distraction from a plot that becomes plodding and a sister act that makes you wish for some peacekeeping brothers.","40","382561"
"3389","Too facile to resonate deeply. Shouldn't a movie celebrating Nash give you some idea what his mathematical work is about? Fishier still is the suggestion that the cure for paranoid schizophrenia is love.","40","268978"

"3395","The movie's original moments drown in its overall derivation.","40","1135985"
"3396","Writer-director Clive Barker's Nightbreed is a mess. Self-indulgent horror pic [from his novel Cabal] could be the Heaven's Gate of its genre, of obvious interest to diehard monster fans but a turnoff for mainstream audiences.","40","100260"
"3397","If it’s the most vividly gruesome monster ever to stalk the screen that audiences crave, then The Thing is the thing. On all other levels, however, John Carpenter’s remake of Howard Hawks’ 1951 sci-fi classic comes as a letdown.","40","84787"
"3398","Solondz's filmmaking style tries to make a virtue out of flatness and distance, and is always more comfortable indicating where feelings would go than actually providing them.","40","147612"
"3399","All the interest and good will built up by the sharply conceived preliminaries is washed away in a succession of scenes that feel crushingly routine and generic, not to mentioned guided by ideological urges.","40","1535108"
"3400","It has hypnotic visual style and a dense, driving soundscape. But it’s also too monotonous and thematically empty to be seriously provocative.","40","2101441"
"3401","The comic-book fight sequences, too, are a little more imaginative. But, like the series, the film is also corny as hell, with glaring continuity lapses, cringeworthy performances, silly monsters and laughable set-pieces.","40","113820"

"3412","It's that end -- the film's final sobering five minutes -- in which Blue Jasmine is at its most effective. Credit is due there to Blanchett's table-setting performance in it and in the hour and half preceding it. It's also due to the courage Allen displays as a storyteller in ending this particular story in the way it has to end.","40","2334873"
"3413","Put delicately, this is one long sit, made all the more so by a turgid story, a dour visual palette and uninspiring action.","40","304141"

"3420","Screenwriter Oliver Stone and the director, Alan Parker, have subjected their Billy (Brad Davis) to the most photogenic sadomasochistic brutalization that they could dream up. The film is like a porno fantasy about the sacrifice of a virgin. It rushes from torment to torment, treating Billy's ordeals hyponotically in soft colors -- muted squalor -- with a disco beat in the background.","40","77928"
"3421","Anchorman has one amusing character, a dumb weatherman played by Steve Carell, and a nicely observed set piece about what newscasters really say to one another when they're shuffling papers between segments. Otherwise it's a long string of heavy-footed sight and sound gags.","40","357413"
"3422","All-out burlesque rather than spoof from the outset, the film becomes less and less amusing. Wayans has a wild zaniness that can be hilarious, but how many bodily function jokes, ultra-crude sexual innuendoes and quite a lot of men and women simply punching each other out can one movie endure?","40","257106"
"3423","Peter Weir's attempt to make a ""Casablanca"" for the 80s - a romance set against a background of exoticism and intrigue - suffers from hazy plotting and a constant, pretentious mystification.","40","86617"

"3440","After a ""Porky's""-style segment dealing with puppy lust, the film then segues to its better second half, hitting its stride when a ball signed by the revered Babe Ruth must somehow be retrieved from behind the fence.","40","108037"
"3441","It's too turgid and redundant to have any real impact. As a thriller, it barely thrills; as a lecture, it has nothing new to say.","40","408306"
"3442","A Roman circus of guts, glory and gallows humor, this lavish action thriller should sate the genre's increasingly bloodthirsty audience. Like the evening news, it fairly hemorrhages blood and sorrow.","40","102266"

"3446","Without anyone to care about, Cobb's script problems become increasingly intractable. Confronted by Cobb's volcanic personality, the film is completely nonplussed, unable to decide if it should be amused, piteous, reluctantly admiring or just plain disgusted.","40","109450"
"3447","Falls far short of its grim potential.","40","163988"
"3448","While there is an undeniable beauty in the film's images and a measure of energy from the exotic perfume of the people and places, Black Rain is in the end a cop movie, with a particularly pedestrian story to boot. [22 Sep 1989, p.6]","40","96933"
"3449","Everything comes easy here, especially the right to narcissist complacency, but Hughes/Deutch are too busy playing Mr. Goodvibes to worry about the contradictions at the heart of their shallow moral vision.","40","94006"
"3450","If you’re going to make a romantic comedy called She’s Out of My League about a schlubby nice guy and a pneumatic blonde, the last thing you want is for the audience to be left thinking: “He’s right. She’s way out of his league.”","40","815236"
"3451","Though Waterworld has some haunting underwater visual moments, the film's impact is weakened by flat dialogue, an overemphasis on jokeyness and a plot that, despite all those screenwriters, does not satisfactorily hold together at any number of points.","40","114898"
"3452","For all its reliance on old movie cliches, Top Gun is devoid of a strong dramatic line. It's a disjointed movie about flying school bracketed by two arbitrary action sequences... The likable Tom Cruise is simply miscast -- he's not the dangerous guy everyone's talking about, but the boy next door. Nor, for all the erotic posing, is there any real spark between him and the more sophisticated McGillis. Cruise seems to think that if he stares at her hard enough chemistry will result. [19 May 1986, p.72]","40","92099"

"3455","Last Action Hero starts out mostly nuts, and winds up mostly bolts. Or, rather, winds down. That's a problem with pastiche: it must be constantly jump-started with ingenuity, and even that ultimately pales. By the end, nothing matters. [21 June 1993, p67]","40","107362"

"3460","The visual style--the orange-and-blue color scheme, the elegant 'Scope compositions, the graceful tracking shots, and the shrewd use of shallow focus--has been reproduced almost perfectly from John Carpenter's original, yet the wit and intelligence are gone.","40","82495"
"3461","A curveball from the man who made ""2012"" and ""Independence Day"" and probably only a brief respite for the world's major cities.It's more of an interesting curio to a blockbuster career but there's fun to be had here if you look hard enough.","40","1521197"
"3462","The contemporary nostalgia for romantic comedies is understandable (even if I do not personally share it), as is the nostalgia for Jennifer Lopez, movie star. Unfortunately, Second Act is a strange, scattered attempt to cash in on that longing, and it doesn’t seem to know what its own deal is aside from a rushed vision board collage of Things Women Are Probably Worried About.","40","2126357"

"3467","Though the script by Chaganty and Sev Ohanian is taut and surprising, I’ve felt more absorbed in an episode of Murder, She Wrote than I did in this film, because, there, it’s story and performance that we’re invited to savor, not just tech and technique.","40","7668870"
"3468","The movie moves at such an agonizingly stately pace that by the end, side effects be damned, Henry's time-traveling gene starts to look mighty appealing.","40","452694"
"3469","Mainly it's marking time: the characters take a definite backseat to the special effects, and much of the action seems gratuitous, leading nowhere.","40","80684"

"3471","The most interesting thing about Beowulf, alas, is its technology. It's the work of a man who has fallen in love with his toys, but I miss the wicked satirist who made ""Used Cars.""

"3477","As director, Foster, working with Kyle Killen's screenplay, treats the goofy premise with a literal earnestness-as a family drama about separation and reunion-that seems all wrong. A little wit would have helped.","40","1321860"

"3479","The Arrival, like so many science-fiction films, begins as a promisingly eerie mixture of pseudo-scientific exposition and chilly paranoia. But once its plot has been bared, it turns into a muddled chase movie filled with glaring inconsistencies.","40","115571"

"3484","The net effect would be doze-inducing if in fact the Dolby didn't attempt to wake the dead.","40","454841"
"3485","Feels like it was written as a fairly straight horror/sci-fi movie, then script-doctored by a comedy writer intent on satirizing the original script. As a result, the film's intentional and unintentional laughs mingle so freely that it becomes difficult to differentiate between the two.","40","211443"
"3486","FRIDAY the 13th Part II will frighten you, at least for moments, although it will be a close-run thing whether it will be fright, nausea or simple distaste that gets to you first. The movie exists for no other purpose than to shock. The plot is an excuse for joining together horrors, all of the sado-masochist kind, and the acting is rudimentary at best. It probably will make a fortune. [4 May 1981, p.C1]","40","82418"
"3487","Fantasy is still Walt Disney’s undisputed domain. Nobody else can tell a fairy tale with his clarity of imagination, his simple good taste, or his technical ingenuity. This was forcibly borne in on me as I sat cringing before M-G-M’s Technicolor production of The Wizard of Oz, which displays no trace of imagination, good taste, or ingenuity.","40","32138"
"3488","Offers very little new for those who saw the original.","40","1321509"

"3490","Relentlessly ugly, preposterous and hackneyed of dialogue: guilty on all counts. It will do well, then.","40","1197624"
"3491","What dulls the enterprise is that Ritchie so keeps his distance from every character that we seldom give a damn. Subdued performances by Mars and Baker are hard to imagine, but here they are.","40","89155"
"3492","Roth and Hurt glower semi-engagingly, and while Norton's scrawniness works, he seems intellectually disengaged, despite his helping to craft Zak Penn's script.","40","800080"

"3494","The Hunger Games has some cool moments here and there, and is never entirely dreadful. Lawrence is both radiant and triumphant. They haven't screwed it up badly enough to kill it, although they've tried.","40","1392170"
"3495","Thinking back on watching these performers, I see them mostly as an arrangement of bewildered actors awaiting orders, as if Ritchie hasn't bothered to tell them what he needs them to do. He’d sure make a lousy Mob boss.","40","1032755"
"3496","Would have worked brilliantly as a five-minute late-night comedy sketch, flogs its premise for nearly an hour and a half, generating too few laughs to justify the enterprise.","40","317640"

"3502","Imagine if the team that made ""The English Patient"" tried to make the same kind of movie, with even more brave-lads-fighting-the-Jerries porn and this time with Extra Added English country manor porn, and without really good actors, and this movie is what you’d have.","40","783233"
"3503","Fans can console themselves with some disorientating creepiness as half-glimpsed monsters swarm and the fine melodramatic performances. But as the film descends into a babbling wreck you start to wonder whatever became of the directing talent that gave us Dark Star, Assault On Precinct 13, Halloween and The Thing.","40","113409"
"3504","There doesn't seem to be an original moment in the entire movie, and the score is so repetitive that it could have been downloaded directly from EnnioMorricone.com.","40","183523"
"3505","As it is, the film is more curiosity than provocation, an artifact of a faded world brought to zombie half-life by the cinematic technology of the present.","40","409459"
"3506","Under the workmanlike direction of Mick Jackson (The Bodyguard), what should have been a rousing and ragingly topical crowdpleaser, instead feels more like a Lifetime movie.","40","4645330"
"3507","When the film leaves the realm of the impolite or even criminal for something far more extreme, it achieves a level of excess that makes the whole enterprise increasingly cartoonish, rather than just awful.","40","5109784"
"3508","A glossy, depthless melodrama.","40","250797"
"3509","The movie is a technological and publicity triumph, and a calamity in every other way.","40","356910"

"3512","John G. Avildsen directs Stallone's primitive script with the corn it calls for, hoping to distract from the simplicity with a few fancy montages, and does a fairly good job with the climactic slugfest; but the dramatic moves are so obvious and shopworn that not even.","40","100507"
"3513","It's so cool all the life has drained away, leaving nothing behind but a faint whiff of attitude.","40","362270"
"3514","Begins with such a flurry of promise that it comes as a sharp disappointment when this drug-rehab comedy skids out of control.","40","191754"
"3515","Apart from the welcome grace and pluck of Asian action star Michelle Yeoh--who all but steals the movie away from Pierce Brosnan's Bond and single-handedly makes this a better wedding of Hong Kong and Hollywood than either Rumble in the Bronx or Face/Off--this film has no personality whatsoever.","40","120347"
"3516","How bad must a movie be to be good fun? How dumb to be smart? (Or, in the case of ""Dumb and Dumber,"" how pretend-dumb to be surpassingly smart?) Whatever the case, Hot Tub Time Machine doesn't make the cut.","40","1231587"
"3517","The problem with all this don't-blink-or-you'll-miss-it dramaturgy is that ultimately everything is sacrificed for effect. When you're dealing, as Ritchie is, with explosions of real violence and viciousness, the hyperslick technique can't accommodate the real pain that comes with the territory, or ought to. What we're left with is a cackling amorality -- not a philosophy of life, just a posture.","40","208092"
"3518","On the surface Monte Carlo is charming, oddly down-home wish-fulfillment, but it's riddled with unexplored class issues and generic filmmaking.","40","1067774"
"3519","Given, however, the consistent pro production value, the evisceration on parade is not campy.","40","87298"
"3520","Made more than two years ago, this is nowhere near as well thought out as its predecessor [""Boyz N The Hood,""] and is far more strained in making its point.","40","107840"
"3521","In this film, Nolan seems overwhelmed by the budget, the egos of the stars, the thinness of the script, and he doesn't impose much personality on the picture. It's all Pacino.","40","278504"
"3522","A confused, humorless grind.","40","438488"
"3523","Soderbergh, the writer and director, has slowed his metronome almost to a crawl, has repeated and delayed and protracted, in an attempt at depth. The net effect is a small paradox: incomprehensibility caused by drag, not by rush.","40","307479"
"3524","A good half hour too long, and badly in need of some scares, Hook is a huge party cake of a movie, with too much frosting. After the first delicious bite, sugar shock sets in.","40","102057"
"3525","Those shots are in contrast to those landscapes, which are craggy, primordial. It’s meant to be a haunting combination, and I have colleagues who’ve found it just that, who came out of the movie ashen, devastated. But I found it bludgeoning — I think it gives new meaning to the phrase hammer of God.","40","2234003"
"3526","The result is tangled and overblown.","40","1735898"
"3527","It is sad, truly sad, to have to report that Color of Night is a disappointment in almost every respect.","40","109456"
"3528","A colourful and stylish romp, for sure, but a feeling of restlessness sets in long before the series of false endings that finally bring it to a close. Time passes, things happen, but nobody emerges very much wiser.","40","112913"
"3529","It's heartbreaking how rich this failed project is, with enough poetry for several great movies, but not enough push for one.","40","383028"
"3530","The movie leans on symbolic imagery that’s alternately tired and ridiculous: Hunt’s impatiently flicked cigarette lighter (yes, he’s a candle waiting to be lit) or a black-widow spider crawling up the stands of one particularly dangerous course. These are classic frenemies; their tale deserves more gas in the tank.","40","1979320"
"3531","Most of the principal female characters are either sexually voracious, sexually promiscuous, pregnant out of wedlock or angrily bent on revenge.","40","195945"
"3532","Del Toro clearly knows his way around the camera, but the shadowy eeriness that saturates the early going slowly becomes monotonous and winds up being just dull, and even partially obscures the action in the long underground finale.","40","119675"
"3533","This Saint is a glum piece of post-Cold War paranoia, and director Phillip Noyce approaches it with the same plodding earnestness he brought to his Tom Clancy adaptations (""Patriot Games,"" ""A Clear and Present Danger"").","40","120053"
"3534","It is full of elegant and striking photography; and it is an intolerably artsy, artificial film.","40","77405"
"3535","In this film, suspense and psychological horror have given way to superhuman strength and resilience...The one effectively handled scene is the last, which promises a sequel with a feminist twist.","40","95271"
"3536","There's nary a hint of suspense in West's film, though, mainly because he loudly trumpets the upcoming disasters so early in the film.","40","118880"
"3537","The movie, which directed by Alan J. Pakula, never rewards the attention we give it with anything more substantial than a few minor shocks.","40","71970"
"3538","Dispenses so many rubber masks to allow the characters to swap identities that no hero or villain winds up carrying any moral weight at all.","40","120755"

"3540","Devil's Advocate is such a bloated, gargantuan, and ultimately tasteless juggernaut of a film that it manages to achieve a righteously cheesy splendor.","40","118971"
"3541","Verhoeven, who inflicted ""Showgirls"" on us, skips the provacative questions raised by invisibility and goes straight to rape and murder.","40","164052"
"3542","This is a pretty leaden cinematic experience.","40","117802"
"3543","Decent ingredients but, as a whole, this is lacking in choreographic flair and plot substance.","40","1186367"
"3544","A weak handshake of a movie, it is slightly repellent -- hardly gripping, much less knuckle-whitening. This ""Psycho"" for fatsos is as self-aware as it is styleless.","40","100157"
"3545","Even granting the enormous difficulty of adapting such a long and complex book, I do not see how a worse job could have been done. Jack–rabbiting along in fits and starts, it gives one the feeling that the book has been arbitrarily chopped up into an irrelevant series of scenes, attempting an unsuccessful compromise between intimacy and the epic.","40","59113"
"3546","Fine performances in this highly entertaining biopic confirm Mike Nichol's status as the director Hollywood wants to work with.","40","100395"

"3551","where E.T. celebrated its young hero's imagination, Cloak & Dagger makes the boring mistake of chastening it. This wouldn't be so bad if the kid's prechastening adventures were exciting. [03 Sept 1984, p.73]","40","87065"
"3552","It's a lot of plot but none of it is particularly funny or compelling. What keeps the film chugging along and also gives it a depressive aftertaste is a middle-aged male sexual anxiety subtext that intermittently sputters to the surface.","40","131369"
"3553","Dragonheart joins Mission: Impossible in wasting the talents of charismatic European actors, and in cobbling together exciting-looking ads that are much better than the finished film.","40","116136"

"3555","It is a cheap piece of bald-faced slapstick comedy that treats the hideous depredations of that sleazy, moronic pair as though they were as full of fun and frolic as the jazz-age cutups in ""Thoroughly Modern Millie.""","40","61418"
"3556","The audience hasn't the slightest idea what is going on.","40","225071"
"3557","Because director Adrian Lyne takes all this so slowly and seriously, Indecent Proposal is an inadvertent comedy. As such, it is much funnier than ""Honeymoon in Vegas"", which tried in vain to be funny about the same idea.","40","107211"

"3559","Joker is a movie that thinks it has a lot to say and fancies itself The Social Commentary Of Our Time, but in reality it’s a mishmash of Hot Button Social Issues without anything interesting to say at all.

"3570","As calculated as the cries of 'Go Ricki!' on its star's talkshow, Mrs Winterbourne is a sappy, old-fashioned and predictable vehicle for actress-turned-talk maven-turned-actress-again Ricki Lake that delivers requisite warmth but few laughs.

"3585","Despite a thoroughly committed, impressive performance from Tom Hiddleston as Williams (and an even better one from Elizabeth Olsen as his first wife, Audrey), the film tackles the life of one of the 20th century’s most seminal musicians with all the passion of a stenographer, making for a dull, unfocused slog through what should have been an effortlessly cinematic story.","40","1490785"

"3594","Pic is mainly focused on the violent special effects outbursts of Freddy Krueger (ably limned under heavy makeup by Robert Englund), the child murderer’s demon spirit who seeks revenge on Langenkamp and the other Elm St kids for the sins of their parents. Debuting director Chuck Russell elicits poor performances from most of his thesps, making it difficult to differentiate between pic’s comic relief and unintended howlers.","40","93629"

"3612","Iwish I could say 99 Homes delivers a shockingly good sucker punch to the American electorate and a stand-up-and-cheer piece of socially conscious filmmaking, but it’s not. It lacks the satisfactory denouement of, for instance, Michael Mann’s The Insider (and Garfield is no Russell Crowe), in part because the events it depicts are still happening across the country (albeit to a lesser extent).","40","2891174"

"3650","Rarely do I comment on characters’ hairstyles in movies, but the decision to give Waterston a hybrid bowl-cut/Prince Valiant bob is one of the most ill-advised things this film does. And in a film that treats its audience like morons, that is saying something.","40","2316204"
"3651","It is one of those soap bubbles of a film, fleeting, ephemeral, seemingly there when it is not. As you leave the theater, it diminishes with each step, collapsing into shards of imagery and sensations of movement. It's the film that never was.","40","118883"
"3652","Osunsanmi wants you to believe that everything he shows you that's not reenacted by professionals really happened, and is documented by the omnipresent video cameras. It's a device used far more successfully in ""Paranormal Activity,"" which had the added benefit of being a good movie.","40","1220198"
"3653","The Hobbit is just good enough to make you aware of how it could have been much, much better. If you take your kids-while shielding them from various nonhuman bad guys getting decapitated both repeatedly and, worse, bloodlessly-they'll have a good time. Bilbo Baggins' quest for adventure and Warner Bros' quest for cash will take him through three films. But your quest for epic, truly entertaining filmmaking will be more successful if you just stay home.","40","903624"

"3655","Tykwer and the Wachowskis' other twist on this karmic hokum - to cast each of their actors in multiple roles across the stories, regardless of age or race - is less successful.","40","1371111"
"3656","Unfortunately ""My Left Foot's"" Jim Sheridan, that reliable purveyor of Irish struggle-porn, anchors us in tedious exposition.","40","430308"
"3657","First-time director Graeme Clifford, a former editor, hasn't set out merely to exploit this lurid legend, and he tries to suggest the multiple layers of the story, but he simply doesn't do his job well. The film has no rhythm, it's stagy and inauthentic-looking, and the patchwork script has that tinny ring that so often infects movies about real people. [06 Dec 1982, p.152]","40","83967"
"3658","Despite its occasional sparkle, Invaders From Mars is an overlong movie with a tiny spirit. It plays to a certain smug superiority of an audience nurtured on junky television, and while that smugness is in some ways justified -- movies like the original ""Invaders From Mars"" had their obvious failings -- it's also, over the course of a feature film, more than a little annoying. The original ""Invaders From Mars"" did something this spoof never even comes close to -- it scared the heck out of you. That's something Hooper might try accomplishing, before he sets about sending it up.","40","91276"
"3659","There's something offensive about the movie's chintzy view of death and the way it periodically flirts with promising conceits (i.e., Goldberg offering her body as a surrogate so that Swayze and Moore can ""touch"" one another) only to back away from them in as cowardly a manner as possible.","40","99653"
"3660","If there is any reason at all to create a big-budget, 2 1/2-hour film epic about Columbus, it is to bring the explorer and the people around him into focus as human beings. But that's just what director Ridley Scott fails to do. [09 Oct 1992, p.17]","40","103594"
"3661","Youth may be wasted on the young in this muddled movie. But age is equally wasted on the aging.","40","1791682"
"3662","Leave your taste in the car and check your mind at the door. If nothing else, Predator 2 delivers one thing: buckets of blood, which is probably why a lot of people will see it. [23 Nov 1990, p.6]","40","100403"
"3663","It's a soggy recycling of gruesome monster attacks unleashed upon a crew of macho men and women confined within a far-flung scientific outpost.","40","97737"
"3664","No need to buy a Christmas present for Redford and Fonda this year. They've already made a movie calculated to smother each other in garlands of self-congratulation. [21 Dec 1989, p.C1]","40","79100"
"3665","It’s plagued by the same problems that dragged down previous visits to the DC movie world: over-earnestness, bludgeoning special effects, and a messy, often wildly implausible plot. What promised to be a glass-ceiling-smashing blockbuster actually looks more like a future camp classic.","40","451279"
"3666","Inspired by the Parker Brothers board game of the same name, Clue is more frenetic than funny, more strained than suspenseful or scary. In fact, it's not the least bit scary or suspenseful but instead quickly grows tedious. The more you struggle to keep track of the constantly multiplying plot developments, the harder it gets to care who did it. [13 Dec 1985, p.6]","40","88930"
"3667","This is generic filmmaking at its most banal, a simple-minded simplification of a not overwhelmingly complex book.","40","814255"
"3668","Its glorious, snow-capped visuals aside, The Hateful Eight comes off as haggard and atrophied. It’s bloodless even in the midst of all its bloodiness; its characters are devoid of nobility, even the horrible kind. These are uglies not even a mother could love.","40","3460252"
"3669","What a peculiarly dodgy, conservative film this is – a lazy salute to a good queen and her faithful Indian servant. It’s a film about the Raj era that looks as if it was made back then, too.","40","5816682"
"3670","The Accidental Tourist often relies on Miss Tyler's methods without tempering them, and gives a tone of crashing obviousness to material that need not have seemed that way. [23 Dec 1988, p.C12]","40","94606"
"3671","While celebrating the lushly romantic, it also tweaks the tradition so that Sleepless in Seattle ends up something akin to a feature-length Taster's Choice commercial.","40","108160"
"3672","Seemingly clueless as to how best to utilize Carrey, or make humorous hay out of its pet-loving shamus' central character, Ventura fails to place either Carrey or Ace in the winner's circle of memorable screen crazies.","40","109040"
"3673","A three-hankie weeper in disaster-movie drag, and its tear-jerking bull's-eyes are separated by long stretches of tedium.","40","120647"
"3674","Words and story are still the lifeblood of a movie, and Jennifer's Body is filled like a Twinkie with half-fleshed-out ideas.","40","1131734"
"3675","It isn't just the violence that is overplayed. There is so much creepy-Gothic Sturm und Drang in The Passion that at times it seems as if Clive Barker should get credit for the story along with Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.","40","335345"
"3676","Russo-Young (“Before I Fall”) takes some considerable risks in her direction to make The Sun Is Also a Star look different from the typical romantic drama. But not all of these creative decisions pay off.","40","6423362"
"3677","This is really a shaggy devil story whose giddy, ironic tone may throw viewers expecting a scary movie.","40","142688"
"3678","For my taste a little bit of Steve Martin goes a long way. Moreover, a rickety vehicle like The Jerk is apt to wear out as aspiring comic star's welcome in one swift stroke.","40","79367"
"3679","To put it mildly, Mr. Hitchcock and his writers have really let themselves go. Melodramatic action is their forte, but they scoff at speed limits this trip.","40","35279"
"3680","Though Foley is adept at handling the action, the film is a grim washout peppered with too many earnest, good-cop/bad-cop conundrums and not enough solid police work.","40","142192"
"3681","Sluggish, laugh-free comedy (or is it an ineffectual drama?).","40","123964"
"3682","Hell, even Heston's performance elicited cheers back in the day. Franco, in a totally, tonally different role, but still the prime human here, is a pale shadow of the ruined future to come.","40","1318514"
"3683","The movie becomes a weak rethinking of a quality film.","40","770772"
"3684","As a piece of moral commentary cloaked in a sci-fi gimmick, Overlord is uninspired. As an action thriller, it’s just aggressively boring. Maybe because it exhaustively recycles imagery from any number of genre films that came before it...or because the action sequences are bizarrely monotonous, save for the occasional bit of gory VFX.","40","4530422"
"3685","Kudrow and Sorvino aren't really given a script to work with; most jokes consist of the two women being vacuous together.","40","120032"
"3686","The question of where Dominika’s true loyalties lie isn’t nearly as ambiguous as the film seems to think, while the question of the mole’s identity becomes a footling side concern as the film ties itself up in Lawrence and Edgerton’s is-it-for-real-or-isn’t-it flirtations.","40","2873282"
"3687","A movie that knows much better than to try to make sense. It is essentially a strung-together series of gags, most of them thought up by Lloyd, an inveterate practical joker.","40","109686"
"3688","Contagion is certainly the most realistic portrayal of a global pandemic I've seen, but that doesn't make it the most entertaining, or even all that intellectually interesting.","40","1598778"
"3689","Sounds great, with this cast of men of a certain age on big scary two wheeled monsters. Unfortunately it only pulls it off in places.","40","486946"
"3690","Nobody here, especially Martin, looks as if he's having much fun, apart from a dizzy cameo by Ashton Kutcher as oldest daughter Piper Perabo's model-actor beau, riffing heavy-handedly on his pretty-boy image, and loving it.","40","349205"
"3691","It's the kind of undigested vision that might have come from the kids themselves. [15 Feb 1985, p.B1]","40","88847"
"3692","Escapism of the worst sort, a manipulative exercise in style that preys on the passivity of its characters and its audience. In the end, Go offers little more than the sour, impermanent rush of a pixie stick.","40","139239"
"3693","If a movie can be said to snore before your eyes, Damien sustains an ungodly, unstimulating buzz. [13 June 1978, p.B1]","40","77394"
"3694","A fragile soap bubble of a horror film. It has a shiny surface that reflects all sorts of colors and moods, but after watching it for a while, you realize you're looking not into it, but through it and out the other side. The bubble doesn't burst, it slowly collapses, and you may feel, as I did, that you've been had.Not only do you probably have better things to do, but so, I'm sure, do most of the people connected with the film.","40","69995"
"3695","Birdman trades on facile, casual dichotomies of theatre versus cinema and art versus commerce. It’s a white elephant of a movie that conceals a mouse of timid wisdom, a mighty and churning machine of virtuosity that delivers a work of utterly familiar and unoriginal drama.","40","2562232"
"3696","The droll has been made dull, a most inexplicable and unfortunate turn of events for so adored a genius, goofball work as this.","40","371724"
"3697","This tired, neutered action thriller won't cause you max pain, but you might wince every now and again.","40","467197"
"3698","This is the ultimate sin of the film, generically helmed by lad-auteur Guy Ritchie: Logic seems to be thrown out the window in order to make room for clashes on a partially completed Tower Bridge. It’s way too elementary.","40","988045"
"3699","The film is essentially a primitive rah-rah story about an underdog's triumph over a bully, and in the times that Americans are living through now the things in it that are merely simple seem simplified to the point of odiousness...In the Heat of the Night seems to be made up of a great deal of attitudinizing and very little instinct. [5 Aug 1967, p.64]","40","61811"
"3700","It's easy to like the cast - thanks as much to their previous work as anything on screen here - but with such a convoluted, illogical and dull story, no one fares particularly well.","40","409847"
"3701","Benjamin Button is to the first half of the 20th century what ""Gump"" was to the second -- a panorama of the American experience as seen from the perspective of a wide-eyed Candide. Here as there, Roth reduces our complex times to a parade of shockingly straight-faced kitsch.","40","421715"
"3702","This sequel to AIRPLANE! is just as crammed with sight gags and sophomoric humor as its predecessor, but the novelty has worn off and the humor worn thin. A cast of mainly Hollywood has-beens and unknowns enjoys itself in this spoof of disaster movies, this time centering around a space shuttle headed for a crash. The various bits and cameos flash past without providing the laughs AIRPLANE! delivered.","40","83530"
"3703","Mr. Barker is no more successful in making the big leap from literature to film than Norman Mailer. He's cast his film with singularly uninteresting actors, though the special effects aren't bad - only damp.","40","93177"
"3704","Nolan’s 168-minute odyssey through the space-time continuum is stuffed with stuff of bewildering wrongness. Eager for grandeur, I went in hoping for the very best from a filmmaker with his own vision of the theatrical medium’s potential. The last thing I expected was a space adventure burdened by turgid discussions of abstruse physics, a wavering tone, visual effects of variable quality and a time-traveling structure that turns on bloodless abstractions.","40","816692"
"3705","Another of those mildly titillating high-school films, soulless and self-satisfied, realising the youthful fantasy of being initiated into the joys of sex by an older woman.","40","85346"
"3706","Susan Sarandon is Marnie Minervini, a recent widow and the meddlesome mother of The Meddler. Marnie is an Italian iteration of Molly Goldberg minus the charm. She might be charming if there were a full-fledged movie around her instead of a display case —Ms. Sarandon is, of course, a deft comedian.","40","4501454"
"3707","Yet for all Vaughn’s attention to stylized details, I noticed a number of obvious continuity errors throughout to which Vaughn seems blind.","40","2802144"
"3708","Drove violence to the point of redundancy.","40","203119"
"3709","While Deadpool’s core audience will appreciate the way it flatters their knowledge of genre conventions with winking, cynical humor, too much of this stuff just plays like smug self-satisfaction. The movie is so impressed with itself that the viewer’s satisfaction seems completely irrelevant.","40","1431045"
"3710","An uneven mix of middle-age anxiety and family comedy.","40","1389137"
"3711","Director Russell Mulcahy can’t seem to decide from one scene to the next whether he’s making a sci-fi, thriller, horror, music video or romance – end result is a mishmash.","40","91203"
"3712","Banal dialogue, over-modulated performances and melodramatic scoring combine forces to sink the stirringly photographed proceedings quicker than that treacherous flash flood.","40","881320"
"3713","That Flipped isn't insufferably cute is a measure of its integrity. But it still strains to view the world through the eyes of children without a filter of grown-up cynicism. It is plodding and awkwardly paced.","40","817177"
"3714","Breakdown further illustrates the axiom that every truly original movie must be remade again and again until it achieves a state of sublime, all-encompassing idiocy.","40","118771"
"3715","Even by the most lenient of genre standards, the behavior of the characters in David Brooks's ATM is ludicrous enough to make anyone grind his or her teeth in frustration.","40","1603257"
"3716","George Clooney is the best reason to submit yourself to From Dusk Till Dawn, an exceedingly grotesque thriller-horror-comedy that fails to live up to the promise of its opening reels.","40","116367"
"3717","This energetically charmless 'family' fantasy lies there dead on screen, occasionally twitching at a funny line.","40","477347"
"3718","Pet Sematary Two is about 50% better than its predecessor, which is to say it's not very good at all. The latest incarnation relies more on gore than genuine chills and is sorely lacking in subtlety.","40","105128"
"3719","Certainly not Raimi at his best, but some knowing genre nods and an array of great effects make up much of the deficit.","40","99365"
"3720","The entire film feels like the result of a market study. Tests were held (it seems) to determine which problems would have the most audience-grab, particularly when combined with two other problems. [06 Mar 1995 Pg.30]","40","112571"
"3721","Painting from a typical kaleidoscopic canvas Noé crafts a brain-bendingly metaphysical trip that definitely won't be everyone's cup of tea.","40","1191111"
"3722","For horror fans in a forgiving mood, it's an adequate fear fix.","40","185371"
"3723","We all know how it ends, and that foreknowledge dooms Singer's hotly anticipated and much troubled account of the attempt on Adolf Hitler's life.","40","985699"
"3724","Dialogue that strains to be colorful, indiscriminately piled-on pop songs, plot developments that aren't followed through on, and minor aspects of motivation that are never known. [15 June 1988, p.C20]","40","94812"
"3725","The joke of it is, for all the pricey bangs and booms, the whiplash cinematography and the editing that turns film space into cubistic tableaux, a Bruckheimer-and-Scott partnership is only as good as its screenplay, and this one is a mess.","40","453467"
"3726","The film looks austere and serious, rather as if it had been shot inside a Frigidaire, and the oppressiveness of the images tends to strangle laughter, even at the most absurd excesses of Alvin Sargent's script.","40","81283"
"3727","The Omen is a dumb and largely dull movie. No true connoisseur of kitsch will confuse the work of writer David Seltzer and director Richard Donner with the masterpiece of psychic manipulation contrived by William Peter Blatty and William Friedkin in The Exorcist, not to mention what the diabolical Roman Polanski made out of Ira Levin's Rosemary's Baby. [12 July 1976, p.69]","40","75005"
"3728","As hackneyed as they come, but the overall mood is less cynical than affectionate.","40","303714"
"3729","Lost the friskiness and wildness and charm the movie might have had.","40","265208"
"3730","Two obnoxious, swaggering brothers -- whose sexual naivete is supposed to make them endearing as well as pathetic -- find happiness in this more schmaltzy than funny Saturday Night Live spin-off.","40","120770"
"3731","The type of movie often described as a fever-dream: weird, offbeat, otherworldly… An experience that also coincides with feeling ill.","40","371257"
"3732","With so much going for it, how could the movie be such a dud?","40","185014"
"3733","Cody shows promise as a director, paving over the bumpy patches with clever song choices, but needs to mix things up if she hopes to continue.","40","1262990"
"3734","A creaky script which avoids tackling the morality of Castle's actions, while Hensleigh doesn't do himself any favours by slowing the film's momentum with leaden editing.","40","330793"
"3735","A grim and uninvolving film, for which Philip Glass unwittingly provides the perfect score -- tuneless, oppressive, droning, painfully self-important.","40","274558"
"3736","Presumably in response to criticism that ""The Da Vinci Code"" was static and talky, director Ron Howard has made Angels & Demons frantic -- and, well, talky.","40","808151"
"3737","The big screen has a very difficult time capturing the talent of James Van Der Beek - literally. The aspect ratio of projected film simply cannot accommodate the full breadth of his enormous melon head.","40","292644"
"3738","Worst of all, the movie's conventional showbiz finale, brimming with false uplift, implies that the traumas of other mutilated and disillusioned Vietnam veterans can easily be overcome if they write books and turn themselves into celebrities.","40","96969"
"3739","Jojo Rabbit doesn’t lack for ambition or sincerity of purpose — which only makes it more disappointing that the film proves to be so meagre. ... Rather than being bracing or dangerous, this comedy ends up feeling a little too safe, a little too scattered, and a little too inconsequential.","40","2584384"
"3740","U-Turn is, for a while, darkly amusing. But along comes the second hour, which insults you for even partially succumbing to the first.","40","120399"
"3741","With its clunky, overworked script (credited to a non-existent Joseph Howard) and Emile Ardolino's predictable direction, Sister Act is a spry but witless comedy aimed at mainstream audiences. [29 May 1992, p.6]","40","105417"
"3742","The doughy Damon and aristocratic Blunt don't match up physically, and they never get any Hepburn-Tracy rhythms going that might create some current.","40","1385826"
"3743","A surprisingly cheesy horror film to come from Mr. Carpenter (''Halloween,'' ''Escape From New York,'' among others), a director whose work is usually far more efficient and inventive.","40","93777"
"3744","This is not comedy - it's mugging. And there's no excuse for making Bean cuddly; he only works with an evil edge.","40","118689"
"3745","A shrill, far-fetched thriller.","40","1059786"
"3746","Friday the Thirteenth meets Saturday Night Fever. Good and promising actors -- people who deserve a better film the next time -- are too numerous to name. [16 Aug 1980, p.D2]","40","81383"
"3747","Aiming for lightness but landing with a thud, Frances Ha is a well-meaning blunder. Director Noah Baumbach’s ode to Brooklyn twentysomething life is a flibbertigibbet fable that, like a self-absorbed flirt you meet at a party, grates on the nerves despite being easy on the eyes.","40","2347569"
"3748","A nifty idea that goes everywhere (and nowhere).","40","106379"
"3749","Really effective horror films make us participants in the horror. Jacob's Ladder doesn't draw us in in that way. It's a movie about interior states that's all on the outside. [30 Oct 1990, p.1]","40","99871"
"3750","Diehard Sandler fans will probably find it uproarious, but others will have to make do with the occasional chuckle.","40","185431"
"3751","Grace and Johannson's courtship has all the heat of a wet wipe and, worse yet, leaves Quaid offscreen for long stretches.","40","385267"
"3752","A story that's so ridiculous you'll at least be entertained by the outrageous plot contortions to come.","40","387564"
"3753","Haggis also appears to have no respect for his audience. At its crudest, the film settles for agitprop...it's no Hollywood guy's call, particularly as he's extrapolating from a single case that could have occurred anywhere, at any time.","40","478134"
"3754","Some of the slower tunes tend to grind but the sort of musical/ retro irony is still amusing in places. Not if you don't like dentists though.","40","91419"
"3755","Only once, in a quick sketch of ""Planet of the Apes"" -- does the humor seem to spring from pure movie love. In nearly every other respect, the film is so lazy, solipsistic and overpleased with itself it's hard not to believe that this time the Evil Empire has won not just the battle, but the war.","40","261392"
"3756","The Dark Knight Rises is a shallow repository of ideas, but as a work of sheer sensation, it has something to recommend.","40","1345836"
"3757","Plays like an aggressively heart-tugging, exceedingly vanilla Disney telemovie.","40","286162"
"3758","There's a funny movie scratching at the edges of This is 40. Unfortunately, writer-director Judd Apatow sees himself as the John Cassavetes of Comedy, so every time that funny movie starts to emerge, Apatow tramples it with scenes of domestic irritation.","40","1758830"
"3759","Todd Robinson's script, alas, drags White Squall down. As directed by Ridley Scott, with a surplus of intrusive music and some manic overacting, the movie dips into cliches. [02 Feb 1996]","40","118158"
"3760","Though Rust and Bone aims for a blasé attitude toward disabled drama - in a far more artificial way than another French film, ""The Intouchables,"" did earlier this year - it's underwritten characters and hoary approach plunk it into mediocrity. As wheelchair-bound Stephanie practices her whale-training motions to Katy Perry's ""Firework,"" it's eye-rollingly obvious.","40","2053425"
"3761","Gladiator's combination of grim sanctimony and drenching, Dolby-ized dismemberings left me appalled.","40","172495"
"3762","Well-meaning and polished as it is, The Danish Girl is a determinedly mainstream melodrama that doesn’t really offer new perspectives on its theme.","40","810819"
"3763","It appears that the filmmakers have taken Hannah Arendt's notion of the ""banality of evil"" way too literally.","40","976051"
"3764","Too-cutesy conceits such as Hitch's imagined conversations with serial killer Ed Gein (Michael Wincott) feebly attempt to ground the story in psychological terra firma, while horribly on-the-nose dialogue flatters those viewers who prefer to keep their sense of cinema history on fan-mag frivolous levels.","40","975645"
"3765","This much-anticipated but terribly underwhelming black comedy represents a seriously squandered opportunity.","40","137523"
"3766","It's a long way down from even the second in the series.","40","67065"
"3767","The attempt to extract the essences of several genres (cold-war submarine thriller, love story, Disney fantasy, pseudomystical SF in the Spielberg mode) and mix them together ultimately leads to giddy incoherence.","40","96754"
"3768","Costner's ponderous post-apocalyptic morality tale feels every minute of its nearly three hours.","40","119925"
"3769","Like Cry Freedom, it's still whites debating racial injustice: fine for a book published in Afrikaans a decade ago, but a poor premise for a message movie.","40","97243"
"3770","Literal-minded to the last, I felt nothing but pity for Tom Cruise, fanged, wigged and costumed, trying hard with his considerable talent to make his sanguinary appetite real. [12Dec1994 Pg. 24]","40","110148"
"3771","Wan does manage to infuse his film with some of the subtle unsubtleties of classic Euro-horror outings, chief among them the palpable, dreamlike sense of dislocation and the abiding severance from reality that tends to make nongenre fans wonder if someone spiked their popcorn with LSD.","40","455760"
"3772","This is a leaden mess that offers only brief moments of respite.","40","372532"
"3773","The problem with movies depicting the banality of anything, of course, is that they tend to be pretty banal themselves; in setting out to be the exception to that rule, Eye in the Sky only proves it.","40","2057392"
"3774","Dead Men Tell No Tales moves at a faster rate of knots than any Pirates film; trouble is, nothing has really been added. It’s the same soggy ride, set to a marginally preferable speed.","40","1790809"
"3775","It's a pleasure to watch the granite-faced action star do his own stunts, particularly a death-defying leap from a bridge. Yet everything feels hurried.","40","472399"
"3776","A pastel-pretty and oh-so-dull coming of age tale.","40","119381"
"3777","But while some may leave the theater tapping their toes and whistling the lyrics to such inimitable original ballads as ""Hard for a Pimp"" and ""Whoop That Trick,"" they should hang their heads low and mourn the sorry state of the contemporary African-American movie.","40","410097"
"3778","The filmmakers don't even attempt to give Kaufman an inner life.","40","125664"
"3779","Every bit as dumb as August's ""Conan the Barbarian"" but awash in neon-lit nightscapes and existential dread, with killings so graphic that you can't entirely believe what you're gagging at.","40","780504"
"3780","It's entertaining in a laughable, six-pack kind of way, acceptable if you're in the mood, slightly irritating if you're not.","40","115759"
"3781","It's a shame that the movie whose coattails these wonderful actors are attached to is such an empty suit.","40","112346"
"3782","There are intriguing, half-formed ideas afoot in Transcendence, but the script and Pfister’s heavy, humorless direction tend to reduce everything to simplistic standoffs between good and evil.","40","2209764"
"3783","Wastes no time getting very loud and very silly and never really lets up.","40","181852"
"3784","Amid the violence, the one-liners ring out. Nobody speaks for real. It's as if they all know they're in a movie.","40","108399"
"3785","The technical barrage of visual and digital effects, quick cuts and strobe lighting does produce something akin to the sensation of playing a video game. So why, one wonders, don't potential viewers simply play one instead of watching this pale imitation?","40","1034032"
"3786","With “Chamber of Secrets,” all we get is a f____ ""Scooby Doo"" episode. Boo on everyone involved...BOOOOOOOO!","40","295297"
"3787","Every bit as sitcom-ish and saccharine as its predecessor, but considerably less distinctive.","40","3760922"
"3788","With its observational dispassion, My Friend Dahmer doesn’t quite help us understand why Jeff is so into killing, and it’s pretty much useless when it comes to clarifying how he justifies committing such atrocities to himself.","40","2291540"
"3789","A chiller that, except for the last half hour of ghoulish effects, is undeadly dull. [02 Aug 1985, p.23]","40","89175"
"3790","For all the director's visual flair, his trademark flashes of gallows humor and his few good moments, there's never a sense that he's made Crash his own.","40","115964"
"3791","The dual-track plot, with constant cutting between mother and daughter, seems less an attempt to establish meaningful parallels between the two stories than the nervous twitches of a compulsive channel changer.","40","86425"
"3792","This peculiar high-danger romance — which plays like watered-down Elmore Leonard or imitation Tarantino — is a risky retro back-step for an up-and-coming young screenwriter with such hip credits as “Chronicle” and “American Ultra” to his name.","40","2091935"
"3793","This is middling TV material, almost comforting in its bland predictability - the kind of stuff you want on the seat-back screen when there's turbulence on a plane - but rarely actually laugh-out-loud funny, and never truly dark or daring.","40","1499658"
"3794","Sorkin is spellbound by his subject, fascinated by the many details of her admittedly impressive life, but the magic he clearly feels fails to translate on screen.","40","4209788"
"3795","This empty-headed comedy about a Playmate who finds herself a house mother to a group of misfit sorority sisters is little more than a recycled version of ""Legally Blonde"" with bunny ears.","40","852713"
"3796","It’s surprising that a film about Deep Throat could be such an anticlimax.","40","5175450"
"3797","Begins too cruelly and ends too sappily but holds you somewhere between the two extremes until the semisweet finale.","40","366627"
"3798","Flexing some of that Jean Valjean resolve, but with a payload of untrammelled, Wolverine-like rage behind it, Jackman comes closest to shouldering the movie, without ever seriously threatening to make it work.","40","1392214"
"3799","For the most part ""Inception"" is a handsome, clever and grindingly self-serious boy-movie, shorn of imagination, libido, spirituality or emotional depth. Nolan establishes a fascinating world, loaded with trapdoors, symbols and hidden secrets, and then squanders the opportunity on an overpriced ""Twilight Zone"" episode.","40","1375666"
"3800","It's tempting to praise The Ides of March as a realistic depiction of how low we've sunk. But that would mean accepting the second-rate writing and third-rate melodrama and incredible shrinking characters.","40","1124035"
"3801","Punishing, visceral violence is the key element.","40","184858"
"3802","The real problem is that Sex and the City is, except for a few laughs, mostly just irritating.","40","1000774"
"3803","Certainly handsome, well made and for most of its running time gripping, the film ultimately turns into a $60-odd-million piffle.","40","119174"
"3804","Both oversimplifies and overcomplicates Moore's and Lloyd's vision, but it never cuts to the bone. It's a movie drawn with big, bold strokes and very little feeling -- a tracing-paper exercise masquerading as a masterpiece.","40","434409"
"3805","The old-school horror tricks (the fake scare followed by a real one, the safe haven that isn't) feel more like cribbing than homage, but they get the job done.","40","949731"
"3806","What I can't accept is that the stringy, insipidly earnest teen idol Zac Efron would grow up to be the defensively ironic, twisty-faced Matthew Perry.","40","974661"
"3807","The picture is mostly tedious and unpleasant, which is a shame for the sake of the performers. Jackman works hard here, and his performance does away with vanity altogether.","40","3315342"
"3808","Perhaps afraid that watching a symbol of liberty repeatedly go boom isn’t enough, Emmerich and screenwriter James Vanderbilt add family drama, an attack on Congress, a plane crash and the possible nuking of the Middle East. What isn’t tonally jarring ends up shatteringly inept.","40","2334879"
"3809","Too rackety and hackneyed to scare, The Nun groans next to the likes of Hereditary. Only the moody, menacing abbey inspires the right levels of belief.","40","5814060"
"3810","Stripped of his former pretty-boy image, the Texas-born actor is snarly and gnarled, and understands what Nichols is aiming for. That’s crucial, as Mud needs something to stick to.","40","1935179"
"3811","The sequel to an influential eighties motion picture is so loaded with characters and crosscurrents that we wonder why it isn't a thirteen-hour cable mini-series instead of an impacted two-hour mess. The film is like my portfolio: full of promise, with minuscule returns.","40","1027718"
"3812","Star Trek V: The Final Frontier is an uneven mix of shopworn comedy and talky space adventure...If it's moderately engaging, it's because the material is familiar and never taxing. Star Trek V: The Final Frontier goes where no man has gone before. Barely. [9 June 1989, p.12]","40","98382"
"3813","Moves with the suffocating deliberateness of a river of molasses.","40","120689"
"3814","Some of the wit and emotion strikes home and the longer we spend with individual characters the more their story resonates.","40","5989218"
"3815","Perhaps the problem isn’t one of too little ambition, but of too much. The Spy Who Dumped Me is, after all, trying earnestly to be about half a dozen different things: a buddy comedy, a spy drama, a raunch fest, a thrilling action film. It’s just that it doesn't have the focus to do any of those things particularly well.","40","6663582"
"3816","The Coens have a true feeling for the sleek surfaces of the genre, but they don't connect with its sordid, sexy undercurrent; that's why Crane is made to seem so passive.","40","243133"
"3817","There are hints of greatness, one or two artfully constructed scenes that remind you why you look forward to new Scorsese films in the first place. But as a highly detailed portrait of true-life corruption and bad behavior in the financial sector, Wolf is pushy and hollow, too much of a bad thing.","40","993846"
"3818","Watanabe's charismatic performance and a couple of colorful minor characters aside, The Last Samurai has little to recommend it.","40","325710"
"3819","This wisecracking saga of tween angst largely avoids the gimmicky saccharine aftertaste that's typical of the genre.","40","1196141"
"3820","Reitman uses Altmanesque sound design and serpentine camera movements to convey the chaos and kineticism of a process in constant, frantic motion. But after a while, once we’ve met the principal players, the speechmaking starts and a potential comedy of political manners turns into a pious, tendentious morality play.","40","7074886"
"3821","A worthy diversion for the very young, but against their more venerable stablemates - notably DuckTales - The Rescuers's identification/memorableness factor remains second division.","40","100477"
"3822","An ambitious but sub-ordinary SF epic in which, as so often, Willis is better than his material.","40","986263"
"3823","Despite some good moments, Agents J, O and K are missing an E.","40","1409024"
"3824","Nonsense is no bad thing, but here it's poorly executed and from Raimi we've come to expect something better.","40","106308"
"3825","What Newell can't seem to do is give Prince of Persia a unifying style, tone or purpose. The film moves well, but doesn't show any motivation other than getting to the next game level.","40","473075"
"3826","Though the film certainly isn't awful, the filmmakers couldn't decide on their focus. Did they want the picture to be be a fun little piece full of black humor, or did they want to go the usualblood-and-gore route?","40","85636"
"3827","Exemplifies Hollywood's standard practice of stomping a brilliant concept beyond recognition.","40","163025"
"3828","There’s atmosphere here, but nothing else.","40","1441395"
"3829","Ultimately the script's often sharp social satire is drowned out by the noise and confusion.","40","106697"
"3830","As it is, so much obvious care has been taken to reproduce and update the charms of the Robert Stevenson-directed original — to deliver an old-fashioned yet newfangled burst of family-friendly uplift — that Mary Poppins Returns winds up feeling both hyperactive and paralyzed. It sits there flailing on the screen, bright, gaudy and mirthless, tossing off strained bits of comic business and all but strangling itself with its own good cheer.","40","5028340"
"3831","An exhaustive and exhausting dissection of a relationship that was never all that promising in the first place.","40","1022603"
"3832","Though pristinely faithful to Maynard's book, it blurs inexorably into Nicholas Sparks.","40","1967545"
"3833","It's a silly, stupendously artificial enterprise.","40","368891"
"3834","The first of Spielberg's films to make us feel heavy in our seats, the first to leave us sitting, passive and uninvolved, on the outside. Watching it, you feel that nearly anyone could have directed it.","40","97576"
"3835","A slow, ponderous, ultimately unsuccessful exercise in cerebral nihilism.","40","116922"
"3836","Without the mythical power or giddy adventurousness of the first two Star Wars movies, the impact is strangely numbing, like watching a two-and-a-half-hour ILM show reel in search of moneyed investors.","40","121765"
"3837","The heroes (Kilmer, Derek Luke) are all totally good, the villains (Ed O'Neill, William H. Macy) are all totally bad, and the macho one-liners are sufficiently adolescent to produce the desired snickers. I tried very hard to imagine I was somewhere else.","40","360009"
"3838","There’s no secret life because there’s no life, only the promise of pets in perpetual motion.","40","2709768"
"3839","Competent, but so utterly bereft of any memorable moments that it becomes a bit of a bore. Perhaps it's time for a reboot – guy wrapped in bandages, shuffling around a pyramid, scaring people. You never know, it might just work.","40","859163"
"3840","This reboot of the Marvel superhero franchise is a film of two halves: the first likeable and fun, the second tiresome and loud.","40","1502712"
"3841","John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd star as two white boys who love nuns, blacks, and the blues. But for all of the dramatic focus on poverty, the subject of John Landis's mise-en-scene is money—making it, spending it, blowing it away. The humor is predicated on underplaying in overscaled situations, which is sporadically funny in a Keaton-esque way but soon sputters out through sheer, uninspired repetition.","40","80455"
"3842","Essentially a supersize episode that ignores a slew of fifth-season developments and adds yet another monster to the mix, one that owes a striking debt to ""Alien.""","40","120902"
"3843","It's a tired idea, and it produces an episodic, unstrung film. [6 March 1998, p.49]","40","118715"
"3844","Maguire tries hard, and has a good stab at Fischer’s twitchy rage, but can’t bring much freshness or specificity to anything else.","40","1596345"
"3845","It's resounding bunk, candied over with the lush music of Johnny Clegg and hyped to death by director John (""Rocky"") Avildsen.","40","105159"
"3846","The film in fact consists of a series of dull speeches spun on simple themes; Bergman barely tries to make the material function dramatically.","40","50976"
"3847","Some of those detours are fun ideas - like Marty's O. Henry-esque tale of the Amish psychopath. Mostly, though, they feel out of place, like so much filler that distracts from the half-developed main story. Call me crazy, but I need more from my movie.","40","1931533"
"3848","Every motion, from the clamour of the racetrack to the sparring of teacher and pupil, has been worked out for audience satisfaction and grants none. This is not a real film, it is an automaton, a pod-movie, and, thankfully, proved the death nail for such high-concept filmmaking.","40","99371"
"3849","Though slick and diverting in some aspects, increasingly silly pic has trouble meshing disparate elements --- horror, superhero fantasy, straight-up action --- into a workable whole.","40","120611"
"3850","The film’s accumulation of unnecessary complications, bad visual choices, one completely superfluous character (LaBeouf), and tonally inappropriate quips makes us distractedly ponder the limits of human rather than artificial intelligence.","40","343818"
"3851","What should be a volcano of betrayal and acrimony never fully erupts; even Moore’s brief meltdown feels staged, and Isabel is so irritatingly tranquil that Williams has no room to breathe in the role.","40","7985692"
"3852","The singin' and dancin' ain't much to write home about; you'd reckon that some $30 million would buy you somethin' with more pizzazz than an Amarillo road-show version of Oklahoma. Reckon again. [26 July 1982, p.79]","40","83642"
"3853","Tedious and contrived.","40","88683"
"3854","Timeline takes the most ridiculous movie plot ever imagined and multiplies it by ten.","40","300556"
"3855","The furrowed-brow seriousness of X-Men is its least attractive quality, but that is the mood that dominates in this film. It's hard to see how anyone other than hardcore fans will find much to entertain them.","40","458525"
"3856","Make no mistake, the high-flying stunts in director Renny Harlin's film are definitely state of the art, and while they're going on, the film works up a serious level of excitement. But as soon as the action stops and the inevitable talking begins, Cliffhanger falls to earth with a considerable thud. [28 May 1993 Pg. F1]","40","106582"
"3857","The surface activity keeps one occupied, but never adds up to much because none of the characters is developed beyond the cartoon level; and the snobby sense of knowingness that's over everything is uncomfortably close to what the movie is supposed to be dissecting.","40","105151"
"3858","Bad Words seems to be heading into the creepy realm of a sociopath’s case study, yet it’s presented as a breezy satire about a rebel against the system. It must be the Dictionary-Industrious Complex.","40","2170299"
"3859","What ""The Exorcist"" might look like if Madonna rewrote it, this silly fright flick finds college student Casey (Odette Yustman) haunted by a Kabbalistic demon.","40","1139668"
"3860","The movie is heavy on exposition, and the story isn't dramatized - it's merely acted out (and hurried through), in a series of scenes that are like illustrations. And, despite the care that has gone into the sets and costumes and the staging, the editing rhythms are limp and choppy.","40","87182"
"3861","Taking the reins from Michael Bay, directing duo Adil & Bilall supply loads of energised style, but without the panache or shamelessness of their predecessor. As for stars Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, they don’t seem rejuvenated by this reunion, mostly re-creating the forced back-and-forth quipping that wasn’t even fresh back when they were younger men.","40","1502397"
"3862","Mary Queen of Scots catches the outline but misses all the details.","40","2328900"
"3863","Howard, as usual, seems bent on mixing genres to make several movies at once--monster movie, crime movie, coming-of-age movie, and action-adventure movie (among others)--yielding an overall narrative that's not boring but not especially suspenseful or focused either.","40","101393"
"3864","This fantasy-tinged romance leaves a distinctly bitter aftertaste.","40","171580"
"3865","The Sting was not made to be taken seriously, but many people may find it difficult even to enjoy casually. It lacks the elements that could have given it true drive. [31 Dec 1973, p.50]","40","70735"
"3866","Devoted Trekkers will have to see it to keep abreast of the ships’ logs, but Saturday night at the flicks fun-seekers are apt to concur this one only fires on stun.","40","111280"
"3867","Not even Drew Barrymore's million-dollar smile can save this humiliating comedy.","40","151738"
"3868","A reminder of the difference between exhilaration and exhaustion, between tension and hysteria, between eroticism and exhibitionism. The line may be fine, but it is real enough to separate the great thrillers from the also-rans. And Basic Instinct is not a great thriller.","40","103772"
"3869","Director Christian Alvart clearly attended horror’s new paint-shaker school of direction (motto: shaky = scary!), but the script’s twisty, end-of-the-world intrigue saves this otherwise leaden film from total self-destruction.","40","1188729"
"3870","Watching The Bodyguard is like trying to have a telephone conversation when you have a bad connection. The guy on the other end keeps saying things that sound maddeningly incomplete....After a while, you want to hang up.","40","103855"
"3871","This reimagining features some fun production design and a performance of undiluted bug-eyed flamboyance from James McAvoy as the titular pale student of unhallowed arts, but its reservoirs of energy and ingenuity run dry long before the finale, leaving the film to lumber to its half-hearted conclusion.","40","1976009"
"3872","Spielberg's infidelity to Aldiss (and perhaps to Kubrick, who knows?) would be pardonable if it didn't ruin his movie. In the end, he has failed to make a persuasive, smart movie about robots and people.","40","212720"
"3873","That's just not enough to recommend it, though it does have one moment of real justice: The person sentenced to jail has truly bad hair.","40","250494"
"3874","Has its heart in the right place, but its funnybone is out of joint.","40","207201"
"3875","Trey Edward Shults’s bombastic third feature crashes and recedes, leaving few revelations in its wake.","40","8652728"
"3876","The next time he (Baumbach) attempts something similar, he might take care to lessen the bile and amplify the heart.","40","757361"
"3877","The most surprising thing about Alice in Wonderland is its general lack of surprise.","40","1014759"
"3878","Angels have proliferated in popular culture in such profusion lately that maybe they needed a comeuppance. A few more movies like The Prophecy should stop the whole celestial bandwagon right in its tracks.","40","114194"
"3879","This sequel to the 1968 smash, Planet of the Apes, is hokey and slapdash. The story [by Paul Dehn and Mort Abrahams] and Ted Post’s direction fall far short of the original.","40","65462"
"3880","The movie's attempts to expand The Grudge's mythology generally don't work, and its stabs at being grittier and more realistic than the films before it are undone by its over-reliance on bloodshed and just plain unpleasant details for shock value.","40","3612126"
"3881","Burton's gorgeously grim film (his sixth with Depp) is loyal to Sondheim's original, both in spirit and structure; it's dark and gothic and drenched in blood, and it forgoes excessive dialogue in the name of getting quickly to the next murky, malevolent, yet strangely forgettable tune.","40","408236"
"3882","It was sweet, but it should have been better.","40","124298"
"3883","The plot becomes so overextended, as Reeves and Hopper wage their endless public transportation battle, even the hardest Die-Harders will consider leaping off way before the final stop.","40","111257"
"3884","Slack and unexciting compared to Ryan Coogler's blisteringly good 2015 reconception of a 1970s icon for modern audiences, this follow-up is an undeniable disappointment in nearly every way, from its dreary homefront interludes to a climactic boxing match that feels far-fetched in the extreme.","40","6343314"
"3885","If this is your idea of fun, step right up.","40","309593"
"3886","Of course, the selling point of this movie is the boy wonder Culkin, making his first screen appearance since the inexplicable megahit Home Alone. Relegated to a supporting role, Culkin is natural and appealing, a picture of blue-eyed innocence. What a more interesting movie you'd have if it were entitled My Guy.","40","102492"
"3887","The movie’s only vaguely human presence is Sharon Horgan (the gifted writer and star of TV’s Catastrophe), who gazes upon the manufactured gags with an air of chagrin. If the movie had risen even an inch to her level, Game Night might've had some game.","40","2704998"
"3888","Wonderstruck is sometimes sweet and well-intentioned, but more often indulgent and supercilious.","40","5208216"
"3889","Midway through, a character remarks as he leaves the scene of a takedown of Ronnie, ""I thought this was going to be funny, but it's just kind of sad."" The same thing is true about the movie as a whole.","40","1197628"
"3890","Leaves me wanting to watch Tomei and company in something more worthy of their abilities.","40","204626"
"3891","This is the first bad movie that has ever made me call for a sequel - to get it all right.","40","466893"
"3892","A fairly silly and ultra-gory schlocker/shocker.","40","130018"
"3893","A disappointed meditation on the '60s.","40","165854"
"3894","In what was clearly designed to be a chick flick, the on-screen chicks work hard at being endearing, while Jude Law, as Amanda's more than conversational partner, charms everyone effortlessly and gets the best lines.","40","457939"
"3895","The movie doesn’t expand in your mind — it shrinks along with its protagonist, its conclusion a reductio ad absurdum.","40","3808342"
"3896","When ""Pineapple"" goes from ganja to genre, it sours.","40","910936"
"3897","This time, though, Mr. Lynch's conceits are less often pleasurably disorienting than out of focus.","40","100935"
"3898","Cool it may be, but scary (or even mildly shudder-inducing) it ain’t, even in 3-D.","40","1085779"
"3899","Bland, obsequious adaptation of John Grogan’s best-selling memoir.","40","822832"
"3900","A mediocre gross-out movie that barely pushes the envelope.","40","1220628"
"3901","Amiable but not especially funny film.","40","328099"
"3902","Give Steven Spielberg some dinosaurs or a cute, funny alien and he'll spin populist sci-fi till the Arcturan cows come home. Give him a philosophical story about technology changing what it means to live in this world and he'll craft a hodgepodge of shallow and unexplored ideas.","40","181689"
"3903","As medium-grade satire (hardly another The Truman Show), Downsizing works fine enough. But it makes a series of wrong moves that throw off the delicate tone, raising the pretension levels to toxic.","40","1389072"
"3904","And let's be honest: Hawking and Wilde's romance is lovely in its own way. But his scientific work? That's important. That's staggering. That's life-changing, not just for him, but for all of us. And The Theory of Everything? Despite that title, and despite those performances, it just doesn't feel like any of those things.","40","2980516"
"3905","Wonderland is to ""Boogie Nights"" what ""Blow"" was to ""Goodfellas"": an accomplished knockoff with all the tricks and none of the soul.","40","335563"
"3906","All the same, X2 and recent action adventures like it constitute a mutation in their own right: fast-paced, slow-witted movies in which the impact is the message; impersonal movies that deny any need for characterization; disjointed movies that make no apologies -- and pay no penalties -- for making no sense. Their special gift is giving little and getting a lot.","40","290334"
"3907","Comedy and irony are not allowed to encroach on the film’s upbeat message, and the drama doesn’t reach out beyond a wrestling fanbase.","40","6513120"
"3908","Rather like a cross between ""Up in Smoke"" and an episode of ""The Jeffersons, Friday is a crudely made, sometimes funny bit of porchfront humor from the 'hood.","40","113118"
"3909","Seeking the sources of our alienation in the explosively random energies of the eighteenth century, Kubrick has created an epic of esthetic self-indulgence, beautiful but empty. He needs to come back to earth from the outer spaces of past and future. [22 Dec 1975, p.49]","40","72684"
"3910","Wringing the last drops out of the idea, it strains to stay on-side, but it remains true enough to the spirit of the series to get it over the line.","40","68408"
"3911","Weakest of the performers is Chris O'Donnell as D'Artagnan. He's certainly young enough to portray Dumas' ""Don Quixote of 18,"" but most traces of D'Artagnan's hot-blooded, big-hearted Gascony traits have been blunted in favor of mere eager stubbornness. [12 Nov 1993]","40","108333"
"3912","The director, Sydney Pollack, who appears briefly in the film, has done his experienced best with this Scotch-taped script. But his two stars are insuperable handicaps.","40","373926"
"3913","Niccol's script, which has the earnest simplicity of a freshman philosophy paper, is merely naked exploitation, a sci-fi snow job that projects a contemporary ethical question--would a perfect human be human?--into a solemn future where the worst-case scenario unfolds as conventional Hollywood melodrama.","40","119177"
"3914","Fleischer stages one chase scene with a bit of comic flair but otherwise never locates that mix of macabre action and comedy that at least made ""Zombieland"" amusing.","40","1622547"
"3915","The film works better as a comedy than a horror, skewering its ignorant US tourists, and better still as a spiteful relationship drama.","40","8772262"
"3916","David Lynch probably should have let Laura Palmer stay dead. Twin Peaks -- Fire Walk With Me, a feature film prequel to the much-discussed, much-admired TV series by Lynch, is a wearing experience that apparently intrigued the director as little as it inspired him.[28 Aug 1992]","40","105665"
"3917","Stalking tactics bolstering romantic comedies are by no means new, and over the decades, film-makers have proved adept at somehow planing down real-world nastiness, but here it’s gruesomely inescapable.","40","1355644"
"3918","Even with the dramatic buildup, Mikati hesitates to make Return to Sender an all-out revenge fantasy, and the characters are too sketchy for an effective psychological thriller.","40","2948790"
"3919","Unlike Clark's extraordinary books of black-and-white photography, Kids is stunningly anti-erotic, though not untainted by sensationalism. By condensing all this inflammatory material into a 24-hour time frame, Clark and 19-year-old screen-writer Harmony Korine create an overwrought narrative that's sometimes tedious in its relentlesshess.","40","113540"
"3920","Let's hope Romero is not tempted to go for a quartet, for at this point sheer gruesomeness overwhelms his ideas and even his dynamic visuals. He would, in fact, have been better off not having tried for a third installment. [04 Oct 1985, p.4]","40","88993"
"3921","In between all the laughs and tears, it becomes painfully obvious that there's not a whole lot of story here to prop up the constant emotional yanking.","40","119822"
"3922","Like all Meyers’ films, it’s more about interior design porn than real human emotions and drags on for far too long. Still, Streep, Krasinski and Baldwin are so good, they almost make it work. Almost.","40","1230414"
"3923","Roeg's bag is photography, but pretty pictures alone cannot sustain - and, in fact, inhibit - this fragile and forced screen adaptation of a James Vance Marshall novel.","40","67959"
"3924","Trashily in-your-face thriller, which leans heavily for its effects on intense sympathy pain, improbable reversals and the mystifying star appeal of Jessica Alba.","40","211933"
"3925","As much as I enjoy Spidey's high-flying Cheez-Doodle swoops through the skyscraper canyons of a digitally rearranged midtown Manhattan, I get no kick from his angst, especially since in this incarnation, as opposed to the '60s comic book version, he's more innocuously depressed than defensively paranoid.","40","316654"
"3926","Neither fast nor furious, this film belongs in the section of the supermarket where blah-white labels and big block lettering denote brandless cigarettes, vodka, crushed pineapple and, in this case, action picture.","40","232500"
"3927","Stuff still leaps out of the screen -- the snake striking a victim, cars sent flying by Death Eaters -- but few things in the movie lodge in the audience's mind or heart.","40","926084"
"3928","Visually and tonally, Miss Sloane -- like Chastain's one-note performance, in which she does little but bark and glower -- is slick but soulless, a film that takes itself far too seriously and misjudges how smart it really is.","40","4540710"
"3929","Material like this doesn't require the additional strain of overnarrated freeze-frames, a ""Cuckoo's Nest"" supporting cast of adorable crazies and a Glee-ified musical number set to Queen and David Bowie's ""Under Pressure.""","40","804497"
"3930","A mockumentary about small-town beauty pageants that's so confidently unfunny it's DOA.","40","157503"
"3931","It loses steam once the wraiths become fully visible: they're just not scary enough.","40","492044"
"3932","Say what you will about the story, but Pitch Black at least looks and sounds stunning.","40","134847"
"3933","With a script that signals every progression as obviously as the large-lettered signs used in homes for people with dementia, viewers can guess after 10 minutes exactly how this predictable story is going to end.","40","3741632"
"3934","Given nothing to do, Carrie-Anne Moss looks on from the sidelines as the film halfheartedly toys with the tired old notion that only a thin line separates the dogged investigator and the compulsive killer. She looks bored, and she should.","40","324127"
"3935","Thor accomplishes its essential goal and little else, which is to introduce the mighty warrior to the Marvel screen universe.","40","800369"
"3936","Often silly but almost never funny -- no matter how often it practices the same jokes.","40","106611"
"3937","Both Reitman and his first-rate cast do their best to add depth. The real tragedy of Young Adult, however, is the story's lack of tragedy.","40","1625346"
"3938","Alien Nation wants to be ""In the Heat of the Night"" as science fiction, but it's neither morally instructive nor prophetic. It proves a lumbering marriage of action and sci-fi that alienates both audiences. It's too dull for one and too dumb for the other.","40","94631"
"3939","The only truly ugly side to this self-consciously grimy movie is the streak of Neanderthal humor. Operatic overacting is funny. Racist and homophobic jokes? Not so much.","40","1300851"
"3940","As Ferrell’s films go, Semi-Pro is, honestly, pretty damn boring.","40","839980"
"3941","The movie finally is never very convincing. Even the special effects aren't great. Mr. Connery, however, wears the movie as if it were a favorite old hat. He makes it look good.","40","99810"
"3942","Sadly the plot leaves a lot to be desired with major flaws never far away. The in-jokes are amusing but their novelty soon begins to wear thin.","40","109813"
"3943","There isn't a mummy at the center of The Mummy, exactly, but a mutating Industrial Light and Magic Special Effect.","40","120616"
"3944","Outrageously overrated... the film indulges in bland satire, fashionable flashiness, and a sodden sentimentality that never admits either to its homosexual elements or to the basic misogyny of its stance. Add to that a glamorisation of poverty and an ending that makes Love Story seem restrained, and you have a fairly characteristic example of Schlesinger's shallow talent.","40","64665"
"3945","The climax, a multipart showdown in the corridors of a hospital, is unforgivably manipulative. What self-respecting director still cuts away to shots of a heartbeat monitor flat-lining? Hancock isn't the only underachiever on the premises--the talented Berg settles for far less than he should.","40","448157"
"3946","Neither a satisfying treaty on diversity and 'race' wars, nor a fulfilling fantasy, it derails at the end of the first act with a confusing moment of anti-heroism, and never recovers.","40","5519340"
"3947","The lavish production has some good effects sequences, but its plot is as corny as the dreadful lurex drape costumes and Jerry Goldsmith's slushy score. Fundamentally, this is just further proof of Hollywood's untiring ability to reduce all science fiction to its most feeble stereotypes.","40","74812"
"3948","A chick flick for do-gooders, The Help suffers from a malady common to the discrimination drama: its treatment of inequality is more condescending than the prejudice it aims to remedy.","40","1454029"
"3949","The energy and heart which Robert Zemeckis and story-writing partner Bob Gale (who takes solo screenplay credit this time) poured into the ingenious story of part one is diverted into narrative mechanics and camera wizardry in Future II.","40","96874"
"3950","One of the more high-minded and painful follies of recent years.","40","120603"
"3951","Despite the chronological juggling, the film's stylistic debts (a Hitchcock flashback borrowed from Stage Fright, a Bertolucci-esque apartment sequence that could be titled Last Tango in Auschwitz) are simplistic to a fault; they lack the multifaceted suspense and sensuality typified by those directors at their best.","40","1226753"
"3952","It has the loose-jointed feel of a bunch of sketches packed together into a narrative that doesn't gather much momentum. Its conspiratorial eager beavers are so undeveloped that they could hardly even be called types. You don't care for a second what happens to them.","40","151804"
"3953","In the new film beauty is sought, and seldom found, in glitzy surfaces. Enchantment is chased, and never captured, in extravagant set pieces that owe less to fairy-tale tradition than to Cirque du Soleil grandiosity.","40","2771200"
"3954","""Wanna see something really scary?"" asks Guest Star Dan Aykroyd at film's end. The Miller and Dante episodes are. So is the epic waste that informs much of this movie. [20 June 1983, p.73]","40","86491"
"3955","Sporadically amusing but rarely inspired.","40","1212436"
"3956","While director David Fincher drills out some perfunctory, generic scares -- not counting Weaver's buzzcut -- Alien 3 is amazingly dull and humdrum. [20 May 1992]","40","103644"
"3957","The Hudsucker Proxy is no doubt one of the most inspired and technically stunning pastiches of old Hollywood pictures ever to come out of the New Hollywood. But a pastiche it remains, as nearly everything in the Coen brothers' latest and biggest film seems like a wizardly but artificial synthesis, leaving a hole in the middle where some emotion and humanity should be.","40","110074"
"3958","Admittedly, I'm in the minority here, with many other critics swooning over First Reformed and the big questions it raises. Regardless, the biggest question I had after watching it was simple: What the hell did I just witness?","40","6053438"
"3959","However mystifying, or downright boring, you find the result, rest assured that the Refn faithful will swoon. Peace be with them.","40","1602613"
"3960","It's the fashion designer's second movie after his 2009 debut A Single Man, and this is a far more ambitious film, with its sprawling cast, various periods, layered storytelling and musings on life and art. But it's also far less endearing and coherent, and feels almost unbearably cruel and cynical.","40","4550098"
"3961","Unless you like boob jokes and preachy sentimentalism, this comedy isn't funny at all.","40","315327"
"3962","Bottom line: Jonah is strictly for kids suffering from rescinded television privileges or adults seeking a nap in a cool, dark environment that reeks of stale popcorn.","40","298388"
"3963","It's no accident that the word ""great"" appears in the title of the new film featuring Jim Henson's felt television puppets. The Great Muppet Caper. Like its predecessor, this film is its own best fan.","40","82474"
"3964","If there’s any justice, dawning or otherwise, at the multiplex, audiences will reject Zack Snyder’s lumbering, dead-on-arrival superhero mélange, a $250 million tombstone for a genre in dire need of a break.","40","2975590"
"3965","Better than the silly second instalment and boasting an effectively creepy empty world setting, it’s nevertheless scuppered by a lack of coherence.","40","432021"
"3966","Airplane loses its buoyancy. Jim Abrahams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker, who share both writing and directorial credits, become so desperate for laughs that the jokes descend to a much cruder level. And Airplane does an abrupt nosedive, turning a hopelessly flat movie, sparked only by the occasional appearances of Lloyd Bridges as an easily rattled air traffic controller whose nerves are such he depends on booze and pills to keep himself going on the job.","40","80339"
"3967","After covering much of its ground at a stylish canter, The Other Boleyn Girl finishes at a plod.","40","467200"
"3968","The idea that sexual harassment is about power, not sex, and that a woman in power can potentially misbehave just like a man may be news to certain segments of the population, but they are not news enough to light a much-needed fire under this production. [9 Dec 1994, p.1]","40","109635"
"3969","Its flat whimsy, VH1-ready musical montage sequences, and less-than-magic magic realism will probably not be enough to hold the attention of all but the most undiscriminating fans of witches and Stockard Channing.","40","120791"
"3970","The screenplay, which begins as genuine comedy, soon degenerates into spurious melodrama.","40","61722"
"3971","In what does have to be perversely honored as some kind of special accomplishment for Moss as a performer, Becky sustains such an abusive, mad, pathetic and immature display for well over an hour that you just want to bolt. What edification can possibly be gotten from such a grotesque form of exhibitionism?","40","7942742"
"3972","There are so many problems with Norbit that when you try to pin one down, another one splooges out elsewhere.","40","477051"
"3973","Casting aside the forgettable ragbag of a cast, tiptoeing round the leaden script, and avoiding the story's many pot-holes (how come he only breathes fire twice?), Godzilla does provide plenty to look at. But that, for fear of sounding ungrateful, is all.","40","120685"
"3974","The details of how the McDonalds literally invented the fast-food concept are fascinating. The period details feel right. All in all, the film's a slick, good-looking package. But it still feels empty. Where's the message? Where's the meaning? Where's the beef?","40","4276820"
"3975","One of the dreariest outer space swashbucklers of all time.","40","85811"
"3976","The actors are all charged up, too; there’s just nowhere in this script for them to go.","40","1294213"
"3977","Very little in Reservation Road ultimately rings true, which makes the anguished theatrics on display that much more exasperating.","40","831884"
"3978","Pic relies on nerdy world-weary irony to carry the day, but doesn't convincingly draw its characters.","40","307879"
"3979","Lots of machine-gunfire, explosions and disposable khaki-clad extras, as you'd expect.","40","88944"
"3980","The question isn't whether Nispel's remake is better than the 1980 original (it isn't) but whether anything original is brought into the mix. And minus a mild plot twist you""ll probably see coming from the first five minutes, there isn't.","40","758746"
"3981","Unfortunately, Mumbai Diaries addresses these weighty concerns with such delicacy that they barely make an impact, thus calling further undue attention to the creakiness of the warhorse plot.","40","1433810"
"3982","A better disaster movie than it is a thriller.","40","120696"
"3983","Watts is extra-watchable and, as I say, the filmmaker does achieve a style and tone the script never comes close to living up to. Otherwise, Verbinski's adaptation of the 1998 Japanese hit ""Ringu"" misses the mark almost completely.","40","298130"
"3984","This iron lady of cinema deserves better.","40","1007029"
"3985","Whatever raffish charm Reeves and Swayze exhibit is lost in the superficial gloss of Iliff's screenplay and Bigelow's direction. [12 July 1991, p.7]","40","102685"
"3986","Director Siri has a stylish eye that makes this film resemble a film noir outing, but the script (by Doug Richardson) is at first routine before growing increasingly outlandish.","40","340163"

"3994","It's supremely annoying to see the ups and downs of romance reduced to archer-than-arch line readings and bloodless mortal kombat. What's more frustrating is that the film, adapted from Bryan Lee O'Malley's popular comic, is an endless visual delight.","40","446029"
"3995","Hickox, the son of Douglas (Theatre of Blood) Hickox, shows a derivative, choppy, jagged style in his feature debut.

There’s a big problem here: too much waxy buildup.","40","96426"
"3996","Heckerling lacks the intuition to let things flow. The actors seem rushed and the scenes incomplete.

"4067","As directed by Steve Miner and shot by Gerald Feil, the film's use of 3-D is spectacularly and viciously effective. (Gray-lensed Polaroid glasses are handed out at the door; this 3-D process works much better than that used on recent 3-D TV broadcasts.) Not only sabers and butcher knives are tossed into the movie house, however; there are also such relatively benign protuberances as popping popcorn, a leaping snake and a blue yo-yo. From the back of a van, a hippie reaches out with a joint, and very early in the film the audience gets poked at with a pair of rabbit ears atop a television set. An opening scene of sheets flapping on a clothesline is attractively eerie, and a later shot of a victim sitting on a pier that juts into a pool of water is actually pretty. The playfulness is so engaging it's really too bad that the gore has to be so unrelenting, but the producers of these films are now trapped in their own excess [17 Aug 1982, p.B1]","40","83972"

"4074","Is Scorsese desperate? This screenplay has the scent of it, as if he is scraping for material to feed his basic filmic interests.

"4129","You're supposed to need a strong stomach to sit through this one, but it's so stupefyingly obvious and repetitive that you begin to laugh with relief that you're not being emotionally affected; it's just a gross-out.","40","77402"
"4130","Ugly, stupid, loud, offensive, and pointlessly violent--let's not mince words--this film should be called ""Total Reject.""","40","100802"
"4131","Johnson's a hardcore, dime-store fanboy, not a revisionist-minded fauxteur like Christopher Nolan or Bryan Singer, and his giddy, goofball affection for the material sustained my goodwill until his underdeveloped grasp of form and rhythm let it slip away.","40","259324"
"4132","More frustrating, however, are the many side stories, which introduce potential conflicts but never fully form, as well as completely unnecessary voice-overs that come late in the movie and culminate in a final monologue, which tells the audience what to think, rather than allowing us to decide what it's all about for ourselves.","40","118564"
"4133","This is pretty much the Lucas mixture as usual, this time in a Tolkien mode, with everything from the Old Testament to Kurosawa to Disney fed into a blender and turned into wallpaper. For easy-to-please five-year-olds of all ages.","40","96446"
"4134","The complicated web of narrator-switches, flashbacks and POV-shifts seems clotted and Emily Blunt – usually so witty and stylish – is landed with a whingy, relentlessly weepy role in which her nose hardly ever resumes its natural colour.","40","3631112"
"4135","The Horse Whisperer is just the latest example of tab-A-into-slot-B moviemaking to come out of Hollywood, a weeper that's built according to a solid set of rules.","40","119314"
"4136","The film's underlying themes dovetail efficiently with the action but don't generate the emotional gut punch the movie needs; overall it feels padded and logy.","40","286106"
"4137","If you can see beyond the eye-scorching neon and don't mind the desecration of a superhero icon, there's a few crumbs of enjoyment to be had.","40","112462"
"4138","There’s a crucial shortage of heart here, from the messy storytelling to the hit-or-miss humor and unattractive visuals.","40","787474"
"4139","In spite of a catalogue of downsides, including clunky dialogue, fuzzy morals and preposterous story lines, G.I. Jane does offer a perverse level of enjoyment.","40","119173"
"4140","""Parnassus,"" while not unwatchable, is also an elephantine mess.","40","1054606"
"4141","The decision to turn the film into a procedural with a redemptive ending feels like an attempt to grasp at justice, but it’s harrowing to watch all the same, yet offering little context and few fresh insights.","40","7280898"
"4142","The sequences are handsomely designed, but frankly, you might as well be watching someone play a video game.","40","187738"
"4143","As far as pronoun horrors go, They can't hold a candle to Them or It, but as an anti-tourism ad for Seattle, it's right up there with The Ring in terms of overcast, glistening panache.","40","283632"
"4144","More Oh Mama than Mamma Mia!","40","892318"
"4145","The doting phoniness of the text has probably been aggravated rather than improved by a formidable casting coup -- uniting Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn for the first time in their illustrious careers and creating the shallowest heartwarmer in recent memory. [22 Jan 1982, p.C1]","40","82846"
"4146","The film fails as a portrait, and it's not much better at drama.","40","3203606"
"4147","It is more than half an hour longer than the Stanley Kubrick film, although it seems more than that – laborious, directionless and densely populated with boring new characters among whom the narrative focus is muddled and split.","40","5606664"
"4148","Kalifornia, which was written by Tim Metcalfe, lets its stars overact to the rafters as it vacillates between wild pretentiousness and occasional high style.","40","107302"

"4150","Suicidally insecure.","40","309698"
"4151","There might have been a thorny dark comedy in this chauvinistic pissing contest. But in trying to get us to like both opponents, the film undercuts most of its sharpest comic potential, leaving us instead with musty jokes.","40","4501244"
"4152","After keeping its balance over much treacherous terrain, greedily overreaches and stumbles badly at the close.","40","186151"

"4154","Once again, Bob Fosse's ""Cabaret"" haunts the stage with derbies and splayed legs, but with results that are strictly Sally Bowdlerized.","40","1126591"
"4155","A shapeless mess, but at least it’s not as monotonous as “Kill Bill Vol. 1.” [19 & 26 April 2004, p. 202]","40","378194"
"4156","It never actually coalesces into a movie.","40","229260"
"4157","Flashy, ""MATRIX""-style action sequences trump ideas; it's hard not to feel you've just watched a feature-length video game with some really heavy back story.","40","238380"
"4158","The result is a Big Mac of a movie, junk food that somehow reaches the chortling soul.","40","84434"
"4159","Even Connery seems uncomfortable and fatigued, as if he meant it when he said that this would be his last Bond film. It may just be an off year for 007; it may be that he has received too much ribbing from Casino Royale (TIME, May 12). But it could also be that the monumental Bond issue is at long last beginning to deflate.","40","62512"
"4160","Those under 10 may love Joe, but adults will find him less appealing. Theron almost saves the day, until she flounders under the weight of poor dialogue, dull direction and a role that seems to value her make-up over her acting.","40","120751"
"4161","Although the movie doesn't go in for quick fixes, it's not particularly revelatory or insightful. It's a textbook paradigm of grief, loss, and regrouping laid out in three acts.","40","120646"
"4162","Vacation is missing a sense of direction. With Harold Ramis in the driver's seat, it veers off course and sputters down a bumpy road. [29 July 1983, p.17]","40","85995"
"4163","An over-the-top thriller, too loosely tethered to reality to be a lesson about anything other than the limits of popcorn consumption.","40","118571"
"4164","Smith brazenly ignores plot conventions and concentrates on an apparently endless stream of crude and occasionally clever one-liners.","40","113749"
"4165","Writer-director Jane Campion approaches the tale with an artiste’s respectful solemnity, but it too often comes off like ""Twilight"" transplanted across oceans and centuries.","40","810784"
"4166","It’s just Huppert on autopilot and like that dry white wine, you can have too much of it.","40","8019694"
"4167","There are plenty of comic moments...But The Way, Way Back is very rarely laugh-out-loud funny. Unfortunately, neither is it very involving.","40","1727388"
"4168","I've enjoyed Ms. Leoni's comic gifts in the past, and I'll enjoy them again, but Spanglish asks her to play crazed, and she delivers with a performance of unremitting, crazymaking shrillness.","40","371246"
"4169","Eager to please and easy on the eyes, The Kings of Summer sails right down the middle, safely tacking between sitcom setups and grandiose MGMT-scored montages without forming its own distinctive feel.","40","2179116"
"4170","Nothing like the sight of thousands of scuttling, hideous, practically indestructible insects crawling up the sides of a fortress, hellbent on destroying the human race. As they keep coming and coming, they’re the only things in this movie earning your money.","40","120201"
"4171","Viewers must get in touch with their inner child to fall for Belle's eventual love for Beast. The film seems somewhat aware of this, casting an ambiguous hue on its happily-ever-after conclusion.","40","38348"
"4172","One can't help but wonder how much better this film would have played straight, without its characters in seemingly constant song. God help us if there's a film version of ""Cats"" in the works.","40","293508"
"4173","So now we have a full-length Machete movie, and it turns out that, as usual, less is more.","40","985694"
"4174","Add romantic chemistry to the list of things that fall flat in the film, alongside dialogue and acting.","40","1067583"
"4175","If About Alex were the pilot to a new television series, there’d be reason to stick around for a few episodes, if only to see these actors grow into their roles and develop more chemistry. But About Alex isn’t television, and Zwick never really solves the problem of how to make a houseful of semi-likable characters into cinema.","40","2667918"
"4176","The film has just enough collisions to be a crashing bore.","40","418279"
"4177","The bigger question to ask about 300 is why, for a supposedly rousing tale of heroism, it's so curiously unaffecting.","40","416449"
"4178","May be simple, but it's also simple-minded; this is, after all, a movie determined to transform its Rebel soldier heroes into men of the people, making it as neglectful of politics as last summer's ""Patriot,"" which evaded that nasty issue of slavery during the America Revolution.","40","244000"
"4179","Yet as sophisticated a piece of filmmaking as it is, it seems hamstrung by the banality at its center; that's why it never assembles into a satisfying whole. It's pretty -- oh, what's the word? -- stupid in its dramatization of the silly little connections that unite us, and it's somewhat selective in its choice of them.","40","449467"
"4180","This muscular yet monotonous ""Kane"" just isn't much fun.","40","970452"
"4181","Why remake Norman Jewison's staunchly cool 1968 heist film in such a lackadaisical, uninspired manner?","40","155267"
"4182","It's gooey fun for the first reel or two despite an abundance of close-ups that render the frantic action nearly unreadable.","40","426459"
"4183","The leads aren't only miscast -- Brody over-mopes and the usually wonderful Ruffalo seems out of sorts as a rascally schemer -- but interest in the con plot fades as the director's bag of tricks empties further.","40","844286"
"4184","An acceptable scene-setter, Carpenter reveals glaring inadequacies as a storyteller. [15 Feb 1980, p.C3]","40","80749"
"4185","Director Steven Spielberg doesn't have a steady grip on War Horse's careening tone, but he'll be damned if there's not 15 minutes in there for everyone.","40","1568911"
"4186","There’s a lived-in chemistry that’s missing from the pairing and the film’s great many awkward moments between them don’t feel quite as cutting or as uncomfortable as they should. It’s a dark comedy that feels too light.","40","4558376"
"4187","With little drama or humor, it mostly amounts to watching a guy complain about his fairly decent life for 100 minutes.","40","5884230"
"4188","Reeves rigid delivery makes Constantine's occult backstory sound pretentious and silly, and converts Constantine himself into a repressed cipher. The film's biggest revision isn't in not making him blonde, or not making him British. It's in not making him human.","40","360486"
"4189","The film may seem a bit undercooked until it gets to the staging of the ultimate battle, but Obsessed is swinging from the chandeliers by the end.","40","1198138"
"4190","The book itself is an easy read -- conveniently enough, it shouldn't take you more than two hours. So you might want to skip the discordant copy, and use that time to discover the real thing.","40","1486190"
"4191","What's strange about the movie is that the best things in it aren't developed, and what Superman and the other characters do doesn't seem to have any weight. [11 July 1983, p.90]","40","86393"
"4192","I suspect this picture is pretty close to what fans were hoping for, and for their sake, I'm glad it's markedly better than the two that preceded it. But Revenge of the Sith is still crap.","40","121766"
"4193","The few glimpses we catch of the Ford's Theater production of ""Our American Cousin"" are unfortunately the liveliest and most convincing moments in this well-meaning, misbegotten movie.","40","968264"
"4194","If we learn anything from the story in Richard Jewell, it’s that truth is truth, whether or not it fits your pet narrative. So either the movie fails at understanding its own message, or it flat-out lies. What a disappointing way to undermine your own valid point, in a movie that’s otherwise well-acted and competently filmed.","40","3513548"
"4195","Roman J. Israel, Esq. is the most frustrating kind of movie there is: one that almost succeeds, and is more disappointing because it doesn’t.","40","6000478"
"4196","Knoxville, in his first dramatic role, does what he can with script and direction that aggressively eschew any insight into Kaufman's grief.","40","338075"
"4197","Arguably worse than its sadistic absurdity is the depressing, limited scope.","40","289879"
"4198","A dreadful disappointment.","40","99674"
"4199","It's not hard to figure it out, but Caruso manages to throw in some tense moments that almost -- but sadly not quite -- make up for the film's daft ending.","40","364045"
"4200","Illogical and glum. [30 Sept 2002, p. 145]","40","240510"
"4201","The Lorax is so big, flashy and redundant that it courts precisely the kind of blind consumerism it's supposed to be condemning. It doesn't trust kids to sit still and pay attention for even a minute.","40","1482459"
"4202","Though his stories suggest a pansexual curiosity, Neil himself seems only mildly engaged, and sluggish direction keeps both scenes with the nerd's dream girl and the jailbait-courting man from generating much heat.","40","4729990"
"4203","The scenes set on earth--messy, predictable satire about the commercial exploitation of fevered genius. The unconscious/underworld scenes may be boring because neosurrealism is a cliche.","40","166276"
"4204","The pre-posterous plot is a far-fetched way to dis-cuss the power and meaning of the Consti-tution in the context of international terror-ism.","40","133952"
"4205","Hellboy is as much a wreck as ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" or ""The Punisher,"" coming and going in two weeks, and as much a bore as ""The Hulk.""","40","167190"
"4206","Like Cooper's lady-killing character, Face, The A-Team is utterly convinced of its own lovability even as it strains our credibility, abuses our patience, and punishes our eardrums.","40","429493"
"4207","Left-wingers in the mainstream media - by which I mean me - are supposed to lap up a movie that plays to our farm-loving, tree-hugging prejudices. But even we know that well-meaning does not automatically equal good movie. Some organic life is needed. And the only crop Promised Land harvests is Capra Corn.","40","2091473"
"4208","More than anything, The Grudge suggests that it's time for Shimizu to move on.","40","391198"
"4209","Jonze's ideas, visual and otherwise, spill out in a faux-philosophical ramble that isn't nearly as deep as he thinks it is; at best, it's a scrambled tone poem. Even the look of the picture becomes tiresome after a while -- it starts to seem depressive and shaggy and tired.","40","386117"
"4210","Trying too hard to grab our attention, he (Marshall) loses it. The art of the geisha prizes subtlety, stillness, grace. Why doesn't this movie?","40","397535"
"4211","While Jurassic World boasts a few efficient sequences...mostly it’s a grim affair that’s not leavened by adequate humour or a palpable romantic spark between Pratt and Howard.","40","369610"
"4212","The big screen was where none of them had gone before, and you can tell.","40","79945"
"4213","Paucity of invention here lays bare the total absence of plot or involving situations.","40","91042"
"4214","A short, dour and stodgy creature feature with average 3D effects that draws on so many film influences from westerns, action adventures and sci-fi tales that what fun there is comes from spotting the many sources.","40","822847"
"4215","Mad Max 2 with Thought for the Day thrown in. There’s some ace post-holocaust action, but you can’t help feel you were invited to a party with fizzy pop and cream cake and got suckered into a sermon instead.","40","1037705"
"4216","If Eastwood had any emotional depth as an actor, the character's anguish might come through.","40","105695"
"4217","Perhaps there was some confusion – should we play this as a lark or a lesson in geopolitical unrest? – or maybe there was some studio involvement to defang the politics; whatever the case, the noncommittal Charlie Wilson's War treads a good-natured but yawning in-between.","40","472062"
"4218","Unfortunately, director Michael Lehmann's point of view is swivel-mounted: He doesn't have the courage of his cynicism. [31 Mar 1989]","40","97493"
"4219","Has potential to be fun and meaningful, but it's not exactly a novel idea. In fact, it feels like a literary-minded ""Lars and the Real Girl,"" the 2007 dramatic comedy that starred Ryan Gosling as a man who falls in love with a sex doll, and which coasted along on its charm and smarts.","40","1839492"
"4220","The original “Elizabeth” was visually lush and quite engaging, but this is a sprawling mess.","40","414055"
"4221","This breathless demi-noir has so much bounce that we barely get any time to mull over the gaping holes in its moth-eaten plot. It is competent but extremely slight.","40","188453"
"4222","Director Larysa Kondracki's fictionalized account of a true story is underserved by a melodramatic script; the result is like a film of a ""60 Minutes"" segment. Still, Weisz is strong and smart. And David Strathairn shows up in is-he-good-or-evil? mode.","40","896872"
"4223","It's overextended and exhaustingly comic.","40","1130080"
"4224","An overblown science-fiction epic in which ostensibly unthinking, unfeeling stem-cell-like entities not only think and feel, but look and act like glamorous movie stars.","40","399201"
"4225","One imagines that Bigelow's story conferences with ex-husband Cameron (maker of ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" and ""True Lies"") and Cocks were free of such apparently anti-entertainment concepts as ""character development,"" ""predictability"" and ""believability."" [13 Oct 1995, p.N44]","40","114558"
"4226","Despite magic moments, this is so lop-sided in conception it's really only worth seeking out as a folly.","40","99892"
"4227","A mawkish family comedy, intent to please, The Hollars plays like an extended sitcom.","40","3714720"
"4228","Despite the off-rhythm styling and suggestions of primeval menace, there's really not much going on here.","40","93773"
"4229","That's the film's problem: Leigh's creation is fixed and unchangeable, admirably optimistic as a person but completely unengaging as a movie character.","40","1045670"
"4230","What it doesn't have is the first movie's primal understanding of patriarchal violence and feminist rage, as both moral horror and exploitation gold. As a result, this is a much easier movie to watch.","40","1242432"
"4231","This frenzied sequel has all of the clank but none of the swank of the previous version.","40","209163"
"4232","This is poor-man's action cinema with zero characterization.","40","1259528"
"4233","The biggest problem with Skyscraper is it’s a little better than you think it might be, which somehow makes it worse. As in, it takes itself a bit too seriously, which makes most of the movie feel kind of dull.","40","5758778"
"4234","You can choose to understand The Force Awakens as an embrace of the mythological tradition, in which the same stories recur over and over with minor variations. Or you can see it as the ultimate retreat into formula.... There are moments when it feels like both of those things, profound and cynical, deeply satisfying and oddly empty.","40","2488496"
"4235","Comes upon a few quirky solutions and movie-ripoff scares before settling into a kind of coma.","40","2226417"
"4236","St. Elmo's Fire is about people who go to lunch and feel nostalgic for breakfast. The latest kiddie angst movie, it's thin gruel for introspective whelps.","40","90060"
"4237","Oddly enough, the film scores with Bowie's spellbinding take on the ageing Warhol. Without this comedic but beautiful performance and an offbeat soundtrack, this is little more than wet paint.","40","115632"
"4238","Fatigue is in the air. This third look at the quintessentially middle-American Griswold family, led by Clark (Mr. Chase) and the very patient Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo) is only a weary shadow of the original ''National Lampoon's Vacation,'' which found a lot to laugh at as it followed the dopey paterfamilias Clark and his quarrelsome brood on a hellish cross-country journey in their station wagon. The new film does little more than reintroduce these familiar characters (with new actors playing the children, who would otherwise be college age by now) and let them get on one another's nerves in earnest.","40","97958"
"4239","The film skips along pleasantly, supremely confident in its own cuteness and utterly unapologetic about how shallow or contrived it might be.","40","817230"
"4240","Characters remain stuck in their cliche profiles, and the direction -- by music video specialist Michel Gondry -- doesn't improve matters.","40","219822"
"4241","Director John Carpenter seems to be trying to make an action-adventure along the lines of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. The effect goes horribly awry.","40","90728"
"4242","While the film has some laugh out-loud moments, it’s very poorly constructed and what we see onscreen seems to be the victim of either bad editing, poor direction or a script that was rushed into production too quickly.","40","800039"
"4243","The Maze Runner is not a good movie, but it wins points for omitting much of what makes typical teen films excruciating.","40","1790864"
"4244","A surprisingly unpolished piece of work that plays as though it were written for the stage and only slightly modified for the screen.","40","120202"
"4245","To its credit, the new Walking Tall is a good half-hour shorter than its predecessor, but even at 86 minutes, sitting through it is a chore.","40","351977"
"4246","The youngsters all turn in game performances, but the standout is Anne Heche, whose weird Missy Egan is pure Mimsy Farmer at maximum twitch.","40","119345"
"4247","Breathe is clearly aiming for the same heart-wrenching emotional heights as James Marsh’s Oscar-winning Stephen Hawking biopic The Theory of Everything. But this is very much a crude copy, its noble intentions hobbled by a trite script, flat characters and a relentlessly saccharine tone that eventually starts to grate.","40","5716464"
"4248","Most of the jokes that might have seemed jolly fun on stage now appear obvious and even flat. The sparkle's gone.","40","73629"
"4249","The film promises so much more than it delivers that, by the end, I felt like registering a complaint with the Obama Administration's Consumer Protection squad.","40","936501"
"4250","A muddled, gimpy mess, filled with the worst sort of Trek clichés and ill-timed humorous outbursts.","40","120844"
"4251","An ill-advised sequel to ""Are We There Yet?"" and a feeble fable of better parenting through home improvement.","40","422774"
"4252","Aside from a couple of rescue set pieces that bookend it, the film is strictly low-wattage in terms of action.","40","167456"
"4253","It admirably avoids many of the pitfalls of adapting this book, but seems to have lost some of the life and pace as well.","40","1731141"
"4254","It's too bad J. Edgar is so shapeless and turgid and ham-handed, so rich in bad lines and worse readings. Not DiCaprio, though.","40","1616195"
"4255","This is a film about people who are lost, and the filmmakers draw a direct line between their characters' existential wanderings and the religious obsessions they find for themselves.","40","1423995"
"4256","There's some funny stuff here that doesn't involve degrading its female protagonists, and the cast, by and large, is appealing.","40","1001508"
"4257","Despite all their toil and trouble, the tale leaves us more bothered than bewitched.","40","115963"
"4258","If nothing else, I found my son's Kryptonite: boring superhero rip-offs voiced by check-cashing actors. At least Steve Carell used an accent.","40","1001526"
"4259","A preposterous, steroidal mess.","40","417217"
"4260","Disney is trying to lure the disparate audiences of ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" (kids) and ""The Passion of the Christ"" (Evangelicals). But on either level, Narnia fails. There's no fire, no passion and not much fun.","40","363771"
"4261","An aggressively silly head-horror movie, the result of the misalliance of two wildly different hyperbolic talents-the director Ken Russell and the writer Paddy Chayefsky.","40","80360"
"4262","With Besson, it's all eye candy; despite all of his mythic posturing, his loop-the-loop camera moves and in-your-face fandangos are the true substance of his films. And that's not much substance. He's a dry-hump orgiast.","40","119116"
"4263","Saving Mr. Banks, a fictionalized account of two weeks Travers spent on the lot in Burbank, is proof that Walt has thawed and secretly reclaimed Disney's reins.","40","2140373"
"4264","Something we want to like more than we can. It's a mild family film with an excellent cast that never develops traction.","40","327137"
"4265","All foreplay and no climax.","40","381681"
"4266","Tom Cruise heads a tony cast in a best-seller movie that is firm at the start and infirm by the end.","40","106918"
"4267","A product that will delight car junkies and drive cinephiles to swear off film until fall.","40","187078"
"4268","The absence of any nuance in the father's character bespeaks the filmmaker's unwillingness to trust his audience. Making the movie may have been therapeutic for him, but I can't say the same about watching it.","40","367089"
"4269","Full credit to Hardy and Knight for making a film such as Locke. Low-budget film-makers could learn a lot from their method. And yet – having stripped away all but the bare necessities, having reduced the components to a car and a man – they make a classic error of overcompensation.","40","2692904"
"4270","Not entirely without charm.","40","267913"
"4271","Fails dramatically as well as ideologically.","40","120586"
"4272","The last third of the movie is as bad as anything I’ve seen this year, with the laughs trailing off, and half of the supporting characters, the zestier ones, being airbrushed from the frame. (What director in his right mind would drop Tina Fey from the proceedings?)","40","1058017"
"4273","The movie is stifling, all right, and depressing in the bargain.","40","959337"
"4274","One of those movie equivalents of a freeway pileup -- it's a mess, at once insistently watchable and a total dead end.","40","139654"
"4275","For all the trouble taken, Nine to Five comes out as a very ordinary situation comedy about three bubble heads seeking revenge on a boss who is a big old meanie. The justice of the cause, the abilities of the actresses, the intrinsic interest of the scene -- these are all lost in the frantic efforts to cram in satire, social commentary, slapstick and sexual oppression. There is such a thing as working too hard. [19 Dec 1980, p.19]","40","80319"
"4276","In this space epic, no one will hear you laugh.","40","177789"
"4277","Narratively static and morally banal. That may be par for the course, however, when half the movie is spent watching shallow kids try on other people’s clothes.","40","2132285"
"4278","Game 6, the first screenplay by one of America's great living novelists, Don DeLillo, is poorly served by Michael Hoffman's flat, soporific direction.","40","425055"
"4279","Fitfully amusing prequel.","40","329028"
"4280","For horror fans who appreciate a bit of craft with their second-rate experiences -- Paul Haslinger's fear-mongering score is terrific for what it's worth -- this might merit a future late-night rental.","40","452702"
"4281","A clunky and obvious comedy.","40","1279935"
"4282","The museum sparkles, but the movie is awfully dull.","40","1078912"
"4283","My suggestion is to avoid this film and instead rent Open Your Eyes (Abre Los Ojos) the film upon which Vanilla Sky was based.","40","259711"
"4284","Nocturnal setting, uneven tone, abrasive score and only fitfully successful attempts at humor create a generally grim atmosphere, occasionally leavened by goofy ideas and flashes of explosive action.","40","116225"
"4285","It soon becomes evident just how inane a film this is.","40","138097"
"4286","Ms. Robbie, on the other hand, aces her role from the start; she’s got an unerring gift for romantic comedy. Still, the film itself comes to feel like a con, thanks to a script that’s too clever by two-thirds, and butterfingered in the ways of portraying love.","40","2381941"
"4287","Rather than plumb the apparent sociopathy that gripped these young men, Layton toys with unreliable narration and the vagaries of collective memory.","40","6212478"
"4288","The setup almost needs footnotes, which makes it all the more puzzling that Zombie's obvious love for horror's past would translate into such a joyless, grisly rehashing.","40","251736"
"4289","With the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy completed and the next ""Chronicles of Narnia"" movie two years away, fantasy aficionados needing a Yuletide fix may have to settle for this dull sword-and-sorcery epic.","40","449010"
"4290","The finished film remains a mess of tangled, turgid continuity and florid, mock-operatic style -- at best a collection of production numbers and set pieces waiting in rain for a story capable of accumulating suspense and meaning.","40","78788"
"4291","Well, the big questions might as well be answered first. Is Jaws 2 as scary as the original Jaws? No. Is it as much fun? No. Will it make as much money? No. Is it a total catastrophe? Not quite. What, then, is Jaws 2? Quite simply, it is an almost scientific exercise in showbiz mediocrity. This smooth and passionless spectacle is too impersonal to win anyone's affection and too inoffensive to inspire hatred. It's so bland that it evaporates from memory as soon as the final credits appear onscreen.","40","77766"
"4292","Candyman, the latest Clive Barker shocker, is his worst to date: an ambitious would-be morality play/thriller of the supernatural involving racism and mythology that seems merely pretentious and preposterous as it drowns in gallons of blood and guts. [16 Oct 1992, p.F6]","40","103919"
"4293","Although awesome in its fantasy splendor, Legend has even less substance than Scott's last film, ""Blade Runner."" And whereas that detective thriller of the future offered a truly original vision, the look of Legend, as gorgeous as it is, seems a distillation of all the illustrations for all the fairy tales ever read to a child. [18 Apr 1986, p.C4]","40","89469"
"4294","After its intriguing start, the movie gets dumb and dumberer. “Third-act problems,” concluded many in the Sundance audience. But the first two acts have issues, too.","40","6169694"
"4295","As strong as that cast and those visuals are, however, they don't quite add up enough to guarantee a happily-ever-after for moviegoers looking for a memorable in-theater experience.","40","2180411"
"4296","The Wrath of Khan is a small soap opera about a man coming to terms with age and death and a son he had never acknowledged. It's really On Golden Galaxy, and it would have made a lot more sense as a modestly produced hour of television. [7 June 1982, p.53]","40","84726"
"4297","Hopped up like a Bugs Bunny cartoon on mescaline and as chatty and uppity as a 5-year-old, Burn After Reading could be seen as the Coen brothers' need to let loose after the tightly wound ""No Country for Old Men.""","40","887883"
"4298","Kubrick is after a cool, sunlit vision of hell, born in the bosom of the nuclear family, but his imagery--with its compulsive symmetry and brightness--is too banal to sustain interest, while the incredibly slack narrative line forestalls suspense.","40","81505"
"4299","Lots of mystery hangs in the air of the El Royale, but when all is said and done there aren’t a ton of surprises in Bad Times at the El Royale’s story, or the way that story is told. Even with a bunch of twists, things progress largely how you expect, only slower.","40","6628394"
"4300","There's more soul to be found in any Kong close-up than in this film's overplayed reactions, which are used to instruct us what we should be feeling at any given moment. This is never boring, but I can't recall another Spielberg film that left me with a more hollow feeling.","40","107290"
"4301","An underwhelming and derivative sci-fi thriller that's only marginally more impressive than a run-of-the-mill SyFy Channel telepic.","40","1564585"
"4302","What you don't expect is for the monster to look like (and be as harmless as) a hermit crab on steroids.","40","97179"
"4303","The movie, a frenetic, explosive experience full of car crashes and gun battles, is original and exhilarating. But more often, it's so overwhelming, it'll make you want to watch ""Die Hard With a Vengeance"" for peace and quiet.","40","117509"
"4304","Although (Reeves) acting inclines toward the wooden, it's always been his weird genius (if that's the term) to exude a charmed aura, an uncanny sense of being the chosen one -- remember, he's been the Buddha. I'm not sure any other actor could play Neo nearly so well, for the others would all be working to seem like The One (as he's known), while Reeves conveys that quality just by showing up.","40","234215"
"4305","Consider that in “Point Blank,” Lee Marvin walks through the film with the look of a man who's lost his soul. You can see it in his eyes. Look in Gibson's eyes in this one and you'll see soullessness, but it doesn't seem to come from anywhere within his character.","40","120784"
"4306","While Seagal is spraying bullets, breaking bones and throwing interchangeable bad guys through windows, this has a certain mindless appeal. But Malmuth's flaccid direction lacks the vicious muscularity and authentic edge of Seagal's previous feature.","40","99739"
"4307","While billed as a romance and a thriller, the film strictly qualifies as neither, appealing to our prurience, guilt, hatred, and dread.","40","93010"
"4308","The movie sugars up Robinson's story, and like too many period pieces it summons some vague idea of a warmer, simpler past by bathing everything in thick amber light, as if each scene is one of those preserved mosquitoes that begat the monsters of Jurassic Park.","40","453562"
"4309","Weitz’s pacing is so limp you’re going to need the electricity generated by a live audience to keep from yelling, “Hurry it up!”","40","1259571"
"4310","A step down from the first Naked Gun cop-thriller spoof, which was a step down from Airplane! and Top Secret!; but if you care about such fine distinctions, this may be marginally better than Naked Gun 2 1/2: The Smell of Fear. Or at least it is when the movie finally arrives at the climactic Academy Awards ceremony; prior to that, it's mainly just one little-boy gag after another.","40","110622"
"4311","It's been a month since I attended a preview, and I'm more grateful than sorry that I no longer remember it well. Drug thrillers and revenge plots bore me.","40","235737"
"4312","The entertainment formula behind this short and nasty movie - devised according to someone's idea of what teenage boys with the guile, the facial hair or the ""guardian"" to gain admission to an R-rated movie are likely to enjoy - is sloppy and simple.","40","464154"
"4313","There seem to be big gaping holes, and not just in the characters' carcasses. The only kind of scene Carpenter appears able to direct well is someone sneaking up on someone else. [07 Aug 1993, p.D4]","40","106449"
"4314","The biggest thing wrong with this mess is its whole attitude. The film tries to condemn all these shocking things, but if you're not shocked, just wait a couple of minutes and they'll try again.","40","134273"
"4315","The film settles into a Forrest Gumpian groove that doesn’t glorify the human spirit so much as sap it.","40","1809398"
"4316","While a certain amount of drama is found in these revealing scenes, it is somewhat dis­sipated in the romantic relations between Leia and Solo....The dialogue given to the lovers is laughable, and their performances match it. So what is presumably intended as a great romantic finale comes to little, which might equally be said of the film as a whole....The appeal, perhaps, will be strongest to the young.","40","86190"
"4317","You brace for a certain amount of hand-wringing, lip-biting and pinup posing aimed at middle-schoolers; given the way that Eclipse initially suggests a potential for reaching beyond a preteen audience, you just wish the beefcake and cheese didn’t eventually overshadow its better qualities.","40","1325004"
"4318","Would be too long even if it were twice as funny. And that about sums up the movie.","40","145660"
"4319","You keep waiting for the movie to grow a brain, for that random attractive neighbor (Wilde) to turn out to be a decoy, for Banks herself to become suspect. Nope. The Next Three Days morphs into ""The Fugitive"" on steroids.","40","1458175"
"4320","Is Brad Pitt the worst actor on earth? The case could be made, and Meet Joe Black could serve as Exhibit A.","40","119643"
"4321","The results are perfunctory, lugubrious and historically questionable.","40","1655420"
"4322","Except for the physical aspects of this bleak odyssey by a father and son through a post-apocalyptic landscape, this long-delayed production falls dispiritingly short on every front.","40","898367"
"4323","Episode number five of the APES series, is the last and least of the bunch, with a juvenile script and parsimonious production values more befitting the various APES merchandising tie-ins (including toys, comic books, and action figures) than the fourth sequel to one of the finest science-fiction films in history.","40","69768"
"4324","Its hard to remember that this extremely unexceptional film was a major hit back in the 70s.","40","75223"
"4325","Frat boy humour is dressed up in an expensive, arthouse jacket.","40","7984734"
"4326","There’s some nice early-60s period production design and the whole thing moves along smoothly, if unhurriedly. But it never delivers anything like the punch of Tom Cruise’s M:I adventures, nor the wit and distinctiveness of 007.","40","1638355"
"4327","With its eager-to-please congeniality, it almost works, but with a pacing that is at once comfortably assured and frustratingly slack, like holding exactly to the speed limit on a stretch of open road, Larry Crowne never quite comes to life.","40","1583420"
"4328","A gloomy, preposterous psychological thriller.","40","217869"
"4329","The conventions that worked for High Noon break down in the high-tech atmosphere of Outland and the story seems trite and dinky. [23 May 1981, p.C6]","40","82869"
"4330","The climactic interaction between Rachel and the film that Greg has made for her is so ecstatically weird that it gets points for its audacity. It’s almost inspired. But the coda — an ode to Greg’s self-sacrifice — is unforgivable, a testament to the ego - and power-trip that is the movie’s ultimate reason for being.","40","2582496"
"4331","While the result is yet another story of African suffering told from a white do-gooder's perspective, this particular do-gooder is intrinsically fascinating enough to warrant attention, albeit more nuanced attention than he receives here.","40","1586752"
"4332","Pimped, primped and dressed to the nines, Joe Wright's Tols-toy story looks the business. Like a disappointing Christmas present, though, the pleasure quickly evaporates once you remove the shiny paper.","40","1781769"
"4333","Vallée and his lead get high marks for kittenish revisionism. In all other respects, however, this movie is indistinguishable from every other throne-and-scepter biopic to hit the screen.","40","962736"
"4334","Suffers from what might be called colonitis. It comprises too many equal parts, and they tangle each other up. Everything is important, which comes to mean that nothing is important.","40","311113"
"4335","No one wants a movie that tiptoes in step with political correctness, yet the willful opposite can be equally noxious, and, as In Bruges barges and blusters its way through dwarf jokes, child-abuse jokes, jokes about fat black women, and moldy old jokes about Americans, it runs the risk of pleasing itself more than its paying viewers.","40","780536"
"4336","Although it's notoriously difficult to play a romance involving one partner's disability or illness without resorting to sentimentality, Kilmer acquits himself admirably.","40","132512"
"4337","As [Roberts'] gay best friend, Rupert Everett is the only one with any backbone, any sense of humor or any decent lines.","40","119738"
"4338","Wilson is just, frankly, dull. He is not allowed to develop an interesting character and he suffers from the obvious comparison with Loki, Thor’s adopted brother played with relish by Tom Hiddleston as a velvety-voiced villain. But then Momoa’s good-ol’-boy characterisation of Aquaman itself only goes so far. This is a film that never quite comes up for air.","40","1477834"
"4339","There’s a decent amount of craft on display, along with a filmmaker of genuine chutzpah. Throw just a little restraint into the mix, and you might really have something.","40","4158096"
"4340","It's big, it's loud, it's dumb, and all things considered, it's not completely un-fun.","40","1320253"
"4341","Art was a labour of love for Maud Lewis: that much Lewis’s film makes clear. But by zeroing in on both the love and labour of it, the art itself – and the point of Maud’s life story, by extension – gets exasperatingly short shrift.","40","3721954"
"4342","Mr. Hitchcock again is tossing a crazy murder story in the air and trying to con us into thinking that it will stand up without support.","40","44079"
"4343","There’s a dullness at the core of Triple Frontier.","40","1488606"
"4344","Much of it borders on the inept and the embarrassing, and that goes for the title song sung by Matt Monro, the ""singing bus-driver"".","40","57076"
"4345","Steven Spielberg's mechanical thriller is guaranteed to make you scream on schedule (John Williams's score even has the audience reactions programmed into the melodies), particularly if your tolerance for weak motivation and other minor inconsistencies is high.","40","73195"
"4346","It is basically deadly serious, and after some moderate knockaboutfun, settles into something pretty dull. Where's the edge?","40","1631867"
"4347","An unfocused comedy about weird Army pseudoscience, ends up blinking before we laugh.","40","1234548"
"4348","This bloated, featureless, CGI-heavy movie is not so much stealing from the rich and giving to the poor, as stealing from Guy Ritchie, Batman, Two-Face and a few others – and not giving back all that much to the audience.","40","4532826"
"4349","It's a Jerry Bruckheimer art film, perhaps the most extravagantly aestheticized combat movie ever made.","40","265086"
"4350","Luhrmann's vulgarity is designed to win over the young audience, and it suggests that he's less a filmmaker than a music-video director with endless resources and a stunning absence of taste. [13 May 2013, p.78]","40","1343092"
"4351","There’s something grating about a film which insists on detailing its pseudo-science while also conceding you probably won’t have followed a thing. We’re clobbered with plot then comforted with tea-towel homilies about how what’s happened has happened.","40","6723592"
"4352","Somewhere under all that bloat is the greatest short subject of all time.","40","945513"
"4353","There's more than a few things off in this tale of a disillusioned professional thief (Affleck, dull), his unlikely inamorata (Hall, wasted) and the determined FBI agent (Hamm, solid) out to apprehend him.","40","840361"
"4354","Aims low and cheats on an ending, but meanwhile it's a bottom-shelf hoot.","41","185371"
"4355","The satisfaction of watching it essentially boils down to seeing whether or not Reeves can pull it off.","41","204626"
"4356","Den of Thieves is such a dumb misunderstanding of the genres in which it plays, such a loud, interminable shart of unmitigated machismo, such a heavy-handed rip-off of Heat and The Usual Suspects and even Ocean’s Eleven (and maybe even The Fast and the Furious, but for scumbags) that it feels anachronistic on arrival, the kind of melodramatic, pulpy studio action flick that doesn’t get made anymore because it shouldn’t.","41","1259528"
"4357","It's tastelessness like this, served up as fair-game dish to a Downton Abbey-loving audience, that sours the flavor of this tittery production.","42","1477855"
"4358","The film is flat and false in the exact same way that director Anne Fletcher's last rom-com, ""27 Dresses,"" was flat and false.","42","1041829"
"4359","By anyone's reckoning, Predators is a middling 1980s B movie; too bad this is 2010.","42","1424381"
"4360","You can buy the special effects, but if that's all you have to offer, it won't amount to much.","42","171363"
"4361","Fails to be resonant and, more important, scary.","42","160484"
"4362","Clash of the Titans redefines 3-D but in the wrong way; the movie is dull, dingy and, well, let's just say dull again.","42","800320"
"4363","Yet another mediocre-to-lame thriller shot in Portland.","42","880578"
"4364","If the film’s story is steered by a hard-nosed focus on the large and small of what actually happened, the way Emmerich tells it feels more informed by WWII movies than it does by the war itself.","42","6924650"
"4365","To be fair, the film is trash and doesn't aspire to very much, but it's bad trash -- inept -- and that really isn't forgivable.","42","165929"
"4366","The one bit of good news is that the first Gambler is currently streaming on Netflix. Do yourself a favor and watch that one instead.","42","2039393"
"4367","Moves so sluggishly that someone must have been dosing the cast and crew with Nyquil.","42","375154"
"4368","If your basic movie needs demand a little bit more -- logical premises; interesting, marginally original characters; dialogue that doesn’t reek of throaty, aspirational monologue after monologue -- Pacific Rim will leave you feeling hollow and wanting.","42","1663662"
"4369","You sense River Phoenix would rather be elsewhere, and whether he’s responding to the movie or to something larger is not ours to say. But the feeling persists. It’s like watching a premature ghost.","42","108327"
"4370","In Land of the Dead there are virtually no good parts. The movie is listless and uninspired.","42","418819"
"4371","If only Russell trusted Mangano’s true story. Instead, he’s turned her life into a over-staged mess of awkward exposition, contrived dialogue, and characters so willfully unreal they feel acrylic.","42","2446980"
"4372","Offering memorable imagery and little more, it eventually devolves into distasteful gore for its own sake. It's far less compelling than its no less bloody but far more intelligent inspiration.","42","95294"
"4373","Maybe in a few years the incoherent gaudiness of this underperforming sequel to ''Interview With A Vampire'' -- will have transmuted into a kind of appreciable camp. Until that time, however, we're stuck with this damned production","42","238546"
"4374","The plotting is so rickety that the action hinges on suspicions roused by a character carrying a cigarette lighter and matches. Is that more rare or suspect than a man wearing a belt and suspenders?","42","498399"
"4375","In a movie this flat-out dull, even a tasteful lack of direct exploitation feels like a failure of nerve.","42","5690360"
"4376","Cars 2 looks fantastic, but the studio has never given audiences - especially audiences over the age of 10 - less reason to be emotionally invested in the beautiful shiny things flying across the screen.","42","1216475"
"4377","Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta-Jones are back, as is director Martin Campbell, but the result has the all-too-common feel of an expired equine redundantly abused.","42","386140"
"4378","A love-it-or-hate-it movie. Put me in the (sort of) hate-it column. My slight qualification here is because Darren Aronofsky's movie starring Natalie Portman as an increasingly unhinged ballerina gets points for being unlike anything else that's out there.","42","947798"
"4379","With Under the Silver Lake Mitchell saw all the lights on the long highway to success turn green, and in the full flush of all that indulged freedom, put the top down, turned up the radio and roared off into the LA evening, forgetting that he didn’t have anywhere to go.","42","5691670"
"4380","The message that comes across is: We're all screwed, and then we die. Ba-DUM.","42","1201167"
"4381","Part escapist action-adventure, part would-be exhilarating quest of self-discovery, The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty isn’t so much a mess because it wants to be everything at once, but because it employs hackneyed and mawkish methods to achieve a false sense of joyfulness.","42","359950"
"4382","The Comedian might have been salvageable if the namesake character were, you know, funny. But not only is this not the case, the film makes Jackie’s stage presence even more grating by insisting with every frame that he’s brilliant.","42","1967614"
"4383","If the first film was ploddingly, airlessly faithful to its source, this follows the second in being frantically paced, chaotic and increasingly exasperating.","42","3062096"
"4384","The prospect of a teacher driven to his students’ level of sociopathic vengeance might have packed a ghoulish wallop had the film viewed it as tragic. Reynolds, however, is just grinding out exploitation thrills.","42","118531"
"4385","The two characters barely even have a relationship; they're a union of demographics--the ""urban"" market meets the slapstick-action market.","42","120812"
"4386","von Donnersmarck's meat-and-potatoes direction makes The Tourist astonishingly lifeless and awkward, reducing two of the world's biggest movie stars to something akin to shy, pimply teenagers on their first date.","42","1243957"
"4387","Has a surprising number of problems: dire scripting, sloppy plotting and coffee-jittery editing, for starters. But its biggest problem is that Blade himself takes a back seat to a host of new and mostly uninteresting characters.","42","359013"
"4388","Even on its own silly terms, Pixels is not a very good movie; it’s painted up like a Ghostbusters-style fantasy-comedy but plays like so many slapdash Happy Madison productions before it.","42","2120120"
"4389","A sentimental epic that forgets to include the sentiment","42","166943"
"4390","While too silly and open hearted to hate, Brigsby Bear begins with a premise that’s weird enough to be good, but settles for a weak trajectory that isn’t good enough to be weird.","42","5805752"

"4392","Suffers by invoking better films about similar themes.","42","181984"
"4393","At its best, it is self-effacing fun.But the cartoonish approach takes its toll: The random twists and contrived showdowns devolve into just so much abstract business, too silly to take seriously and too unmotivated to make sense.","42","160127"
"4394","Smith has badly overextended his modest filmmaking gifts.","42","120655"
"4395","Twelve ogles the lost boys and girls as they make their mistakes. But unlike the novel, the movie never really gets inside these kids, who aren't in the least all right.","42","1407084"
"4396","As hard as it tries to capture that blend of domestic comedy and paternal angst that made its predecessor a classic, it is still a pale shadow and a barely passable Steve Martin vehicle. [20 Dec 1991, p.10]","42","101862"
"4397","It doesn’t work on a purely aesthetic level or as a political statement, and the combination of the two goes together about as well as a mid-level Coens comedy and a morality play about racism masquerading as a thesis.","42","491175"

"4406","The Predator isn’t a dumb movie exactly. But it’s not a smart one either. What it is, is something uncomfortably in between: a satire of a franchise that was already in on its own macho joke.","42","3829266"
"4407","A sloppy, schizophrenic effort; a rollicking parody, a somber romantic tragedy, an orgy of violence and an incomplete work on all fronts. [24 Dec 1993, p.9]","42","108358"
"4408","While “Jason Bourne meets Temple Grandin” might sound like an interesting idea for a studio write-off, “James Bond meets Michael Clayton meets Rain Man meets all of their friends and enemies” is a dull movie that’s too full of distractions to pay out any dividends.","42","2140479"
"4409","Happy Death Day is a lot of fun when it allows itself to have fun.","42","5308322"
"4410","In Infinitely Polar Bear, Ruffalo attempts to put a recognizable, charismatic, slightly worn face on manic depression. Somehow, though, he comes up with a vaguely theatrical, and vaguely wearying, performance.","42","1969062"
"4411","While both actors have been hammier and more hilarious, and neither one overdoes things enough to be notable, they at least seem to be having loads of flailing fun as they conjure up CGI scenery to chew on. And when Apprentice limits itself to their battle, it's generally fitful dumb fun.","42","963966"
"4412","Throwing in some gnarly gore—and Brightburn indulges a couple of truly gruesome flinches—doesn’t change the plodding inevitability with which Brandon goes super-evil.","42","7752126"
"4413","The kind of rote schlocker that rarely makes it to big screens anymore.","42","200469"
"4414","Disappointing and confounding, Velvet Buzzsaw can ultimately be filed under What Could Have Been given the kind of talent involved.","42","7043012"
"4415","So hyperfrenetic that, in the end, you wonder if the Wachowskis aren't trying to pull off an elaborate hoax – a deranged techno fantasia posing as retro-ish family fare.","42","811080"
"4416","Like many video games, Resident Evil has a drearily long setup, then a lot of blood and gore, then an overextended ending.","42","120804"
"4417","After a brisk start, the script turns out to be a rough and humorless beast slouching its way towards utter ludicrousness.","42","1038686"
"4418","So here I am, trying to like The Purge because I’m drawn to its simple and horrific premise, and it’s treating me (and you) as if we have the IQs of lawn ornaments.","42","2184339"
"4419","The plot is simplicity itself, and Jaden's quirk-free character and bland performance don't add anything. It's actually a little sad that M. Night Shyamalan has descended to this sort of vanity-project work-for-hire, but at least he didn't insist on some absurd twist ending.","42","1815862"
"4420","The Meg is lackadaisically paced, dull to look at, and has trouble keeping track of space and plot.","42","4779682"
"4421","As narrow as the universe is wide, this dull, sanitized dramatization of history’s tawdriest astronaut scandal has absolutely no idea how touching the heavens might transform a person — it only knows that it does.","42","4682804"
"4422","A terrible title for a not-much-better movie, missing a grammatically correct question mark and most of the point with romantic comedies.","42","1341188"
"4423","The Ruins is lumpish, static, and obvious. It's a gringos-go-home cautionary fright flick done in the spirit of a cheap '50s horror movie, except that it leaves you longing for the competence of grade-Z studio-system trash.","42","963794"
"4424","In A Scanner Darkly, we're watching other people freak out, but the film is maddening to sit through because their freak-outs never become ours.","42","405296"
"4425","If you prefer hipster romantic comedies that are unromantic and not too funny, Lee Toland Krieger's movie may be your grande half-caf caramel mocha frappe.","42","1405365"
"4426","Over time, Gold becomes nothing more than a masterclass in watching a great actor try to build a fortune out of dirt.","42","1800302"
"4427","Even if the film were sharper, even if it was made by satirists on the order of Stanley Kubrick and Terry Southern in their “Dr. Strangelove” days, I would still argue that greenlighting such a film is a blunder. The exercise of free speech does not exempt one from the consequences of stupidity.","42","2788710"
"4428","Ferrell, of course, has his moments. But he doesn't have an engaging ""center"" as a comedian.","42","357413"
"4429","Vox Lux wants to be everything and winds up being nothing. By the end, when the whole thing devolves into a dubious concert film, and we’re watching fake fans go crazy over fake songs, there’s this uncanny valley of universal bliss that’s just achingly hollow.","42","5960374"
"4430","What started out as a fleet one-off swashbuckler with novel supernatural elements has become loaded and graceless, with each new entry barreling across the goal line like William ""The Refrigerator"" Perry.","42","449088"
"4431","The trouble with Eastwood’s attempt to make a thriller with heart is that, in retreating from his darker impulses, he muffles his own voice as a moviemaker.","42","107808"
"4432","The result is a Halloween movie in horror limbo.","42","245674"
"4433","An overlong, overstuffed mess with only sporadic moments of clarity and purpose.","42","116365"
"4434","In the movie, the unconverted will hold their ears as the banal tunes blare out in multichannel sound. And they'll wince as the camera closes in on every heart-tugging moment.","42","294870"
"4435","Munich is so broad-stroke it cuts itself at every turn. It's also a thoroughly lifeless movie.","42","408306"
"4436","The main difference is that while the ""Twilight"" films strive for straight-faced grimness, Red Riding Hood often verges on outright florid hilarity. It isn't laughing at itself, but that needn't stop the audience.","42","1486185"
"4437","With Pet Sematary, it seems like the remake was ordered, and the filmmakers tried unsuccessfully to come up with a reason. Sometimes less is better too.","42","837563"
"4438","Director John McTiernan is normally a competent director but he's simply not at his best here.He shows little flair for comedy, his performances are one-dimensional, and his action sequences are predictable and sometimes amazingly sloppy. [18 Jun 1993, p.5]","42","107362"
"4439","Few films come out in any given year with creative choices as baffling as the ones made by Edward Norton’s Motherless Brooklyn.","42","385887"
"4440","Emmerich takes the story at face value and delivers a film unlike any of his others. That is to say, a boring one.","42","1521197"
"4441","Lopez can't decide if she's playing Lavoe's victim or enabler -- the movie sort of half blames her -- and neither of her characters is likable. The music's lovely, though.","42","458522"
"4442","The joy of Ready Player One does indeed come from its world-building and kaleidoscopic mashup of pop culture—what Spielberg would likely dub its “movie” elements.... At a certain point, though, Ready Player One wants to be appreciated as a film as well as a movie, no matter what Spielberg says. And that’s where it begins to falter.","42","1677720"
"4443","Berry has no character to play, but Sharon Stone's an over-the-top hoot.","42","327554"
"4444","The story is still mostly fabulous, and its novelty helps carry the film, but this still comes across like a poor high-school stage version: sincere and kind of sweet, but endlessly clumsy.","42","452694"
"4445","Owing more to the sword-and-sex-play fantasies of 12-year-olds than the traditions of Old English poetry, Robert Zemeckis' Beowulf will allow adolescents to have their cheesecake - and beefcake - and eat it, too.","42","442933"
"4446","Despite its undercurrent of anger at Wilde’s mistreatment by fashionable English society, the film feels like a vanity production—and Everett clearly fears that it may be perceived that way, as he opts to bill himself fifth (non-alphabetically) in the cast, despite appearing in almost every shot. Such false modesty ill suits a flamboyant legend like Oscar Wilde, even in a perverse account of his slow fade to black.","42","2404639"
"4447","Foster seems blinkered and tone-deaf to what's actually appearing onscreen.","42","1321860"
"4448","Thanks to assured direction and a fine cast, Hills isn't terrible, only terribly unnecessary.","42","454841"
"4449","The movie starts out as a potboiler with a troubling character arc; unfortunately, it ends up becoming a goofy, story-overwhelming Rube Goldberg contraption that would make the producers of the ""Saw"" series blush.","42","1197624"
"4450","As a movie, it’s the cinematic equivalent of paint-by-numbers: competent, attractive even, but take a single step closer and the lines peek through. There’s no need to pay money to go see Upgrade: If you select it on a plane and sleep through 60% of it, you’ve seen it in its entirety.","42","6499752"
"4451","In the presence of profound questions, the filmmaker goes profoundly shallow.","42","183523"
"4452","Although the film's visuals are a cut above, say, ""Sin City,"" another serioso graphic novel-turned-movie, it has the same mood: a film-noir-ish soddenness punctuated by megaviolence. Watchmen is the anti-""Incredibles.""","42","409459"
"4453","An ambitious but shapeless mix of road movie, romance and critique of black male-female relationships. [23 Jul 1993]","42","107840"
"4454","There are complicated elements at work here, with threads of curdled vengeance, victim entitlement, and insanity bound together in ways it would take a much smarter film to unravel. Snow White And The Huntsman doesn't try, and the film just keeps getting dumber as it goes along.","42","1735898"
"4455","A deliriously brain-dead erotic thriller...The patients (played by, among others, Lesley Ann Warren and Brad Dourif) are all nutjob cliches.","42","109456"
"4456","After its midway mark, just lumbers until it fizzles out.","42","195945"
"4457","The major problem with Pattinson’s ascendancy to the Dean throne: His soulfulness is a pose, an effect achieved more by hair and makeup (and yes, genetics) than the scenes where he’s required to emote at high volume.","42","1403981"
"4458","A special-effects-and-chase-to-the-death movie, with little special about it.","42","164052"
"4459","A cumbersome dud, grows draggier with each new revelation.","42","225071"
"4460","Directed by Kathryn Bigelow with lots of dull spots, a few effectively intense moments, and as much gore as the monster genre usually calls for nowadays.","42","93605"
"4461","The new movie is a dusty piñata stuffed with omens and not much more.","42","204313"
"4462","Perhaps Nair believes that heroism in our tabloid era has become degraded. If so, she overcorrected. Amelia is so pure in heart that it slides right off the screen.","42","1129445"
"4463","A major disappointment. Bleak, brutal, and ultimately pointless.","42","2345737"
"4464","A lack of courage on behalf of the filmmakers to take any position renders the film narratively limp.","42","1837703"
"4465","Despite the worthy efforts of stars Tom Hiddleston and Elizabeth Olsen, the Hank Williams biopic I Saw The Light is a shockingly bad movie.","42","1490785"
"4466","Turns into a grab-bag freak show as desperate as it is arbitrary.","42","263488"
"4467","The official R rating is for ""strong language, sexual content, drug use and some crude humor,"" but the MPAA is just being polite. It's all crude.","42","366551"
"4468","There’s a fundamental problem here, one of conception, not of execution.","42","2737304"
"4469","The film's first-time director, the TV-commercial-trained Marcel Langenegger, is out to emulate Hitchcock with dashes of ""Vertigo,"" ""Strangers on a Train"" and more. But his homage is uninspired and disconnected, and his film is a bore.","42","800240"
"4470","Despite the silly and sentimental nature of his dialogue, Bridges, in this wondrous emeritus phase of his career, sells every single line. Well, almost every.","42","460890"
"4471","Nothing more than a bad harvest.","42","401445"
"4472","It's classic movie manipulation gone amok.","42","230838"
"4473","Violence in the movies, no matter how many CGI effects are utilized, can't help but be far more luridly realistic. And, in the case of Wanted, to what end?","42","493464"
"4474","Caught in a pretentious no-man’s land between horror and melodrama.","42","838247"
"4475","Its half-baked political ideas take away from the wholly satisfying and surreal Pixar riff it could have been.","42","1700841"
"4476","Cruise is thrown into many sticky situations, with legions of trained assassins surrounding him on all sides, but he never once suggests that things aren’t entirely under control. It’s profoundly boring to watch a hero without weaknesses; after all, even Superman has Kryptonite.","42","1013743"
"4477","So shameless is The Kingdom, ignoring consequence and treating its audience like cash-dispensing machines with buttons to be pushed rather than thinking individuals willing to consider the reality of America's entanglement with the Middle East.","42","431197"
"4478","Ultimately, however, Kiss is too ridiculous to engage us as a thriller yet too cringingly self-conscious to amuse us as camp.","42","116908"
"4479","How can we take this doomsday scenario seriously when we keep waiting for Bruce Willis to rise from the ashes?","42","443274"
"4480","There's precious little in Luc Besson's solemnly inflated, battle-weary historical epic.","42","151137"
"4481","In one corner, you have Scott, fighting to tell an existential thriller about gods, creators, and evolution, and in the other, you have this obvious insistence to pay an ungodly amount of fan service to the past.","42","2316204"
"4482","Terminally awkward in the way it meshes fake real footage with faker fake footage. It isn’t required to be convincing as fact, but it doesn’t convince as fiction, either.","42","1220198"
"4483","Eventually so generic that it might as well be about anyone, Film Stars Don’t Die in Liverpool creates a foul tension between the paint-by-numbers quality of its approach and the uniqueness of its affair.","42","5711148"
"4484","Too long by at least a half hour, and both dull and repetitive as it goes on, Cloud Atlas reaches for envelope-pushing storytelling but never delivers on its promise.","42","1371111"
"4485","This thinly autobiographical gangsta odyssey never achieves liftoff, and Jackson is unconvincing.","42","430308"
"4486","Proficiently filmed and utterly uninspired.","42","146336"
"4487","Overheated claptrap that takes an issue of vital national importance and turns it into an inept cartoon that emboldens the worst instincts in our national character.","42","804522"
"4488","In Columbus’ hands, it once again all breaks down into a series of rushed, breathless special-effects setpieces, in a thrill ride that isn’t headed anywhere new.","42","814255"
"4489","Victoria & Abdul is an otherwise benignly toothless, pleasantly glossy affair, but it does force us to confront one tricky question: When treating a subject as fraught as British imperial rule, when does a film’s benign inoffensiveness become offensive in and of itself?","42","5816682"
"4490","Did it move me? And the answer is no. I thought it has a certain ghoulish, voyeuristic fascination, but I found it strangely remote and uninvolving on both emotional and spiritual levels.","42","335345"
"4491","Daniel tells Natasha of his elements for falling in love, “My ingredients are friendship, chemistry, the X factor,” and he assures her that they have that last one. But that’s what The Sun Is Also a Star lacks: that ineffable quality that makes it work. Though we spend nearly two hours in its presence, it never makes us fall in love with it, despite its best efforts.","42","6423362"
"4492","After a cheeky, campy start, The Ninth Gate leaves you with a bitter and dull aftertaste.","42","142688"
"4493","Since the only really good ""Planet of the Apes"" movie was the 1968 original with Charlton Heston, I've always wondered why filmmakers can't just leave well enough alone.","42","1318514"
"4494","While it’s Lawrence’s most mature and relatively subtle effort to date, it’s also, unfortunately, a slog. The director’s well-intentioned patience ultimately means nothing when its interminable pacing makes the movie feel twice as protracted as its longwinded, two-hour-plus running time.","42","2873282"
"4495","Wild Hogs puts the ""ick"" into City Slickers.","42","486946"
"4496","Resembles nothing more than an overstuffed, undernourished ""Brady Bunch"" episode, only not as funny.","42","349205"
"4497","In a post-Matrix, post-John Woo world, a handful of slow-motion shootouts shouldn't be all that's on offer.","42","467197"
"4498","This is certainly the grubbiest Holmes in movie history.","42","988045"
"4499","You just wish that the kind of attention lavished on the visuals of Despicable Me 2 could have carried over to its storytelling. Despicable Me 2 lacks emotion and depth, and all the minions in the world can't make up for that.","42","1690953"
"4500","Offhand, I can’t think of an actor who could use a brain implant more. The trouble isn’t that Reeves talks like a surfer dude; it’s that he tries so hard not to talk like a surfer dude.","42","113481"
"4501","A movie that wouldn't get much attention if the creator of ""Titanic"" and ""Avatar"" (as the ads overhype) weren't tangentially involved.","42","881320"
"4502","Worse, he (Reiner) vacuum-seals it all in a patronizingly wholesome package, like an extended episode of ""The Wonder Years"" with all the wonder sucked out.","42","817177"
"4503","Director Gaspar Noé proved a shock poet in ""Irreversible"" (2003). In Enter the Void, he's a shockingly tedious show-off.","42","1191111"
"4504","Sadly, it lacks the classic awfulness that might have lifted it into the pantheon of Truly Bad Movies. Instead, what we have here is a garden variety bad movie, of which there have been all too many lately.","42","985699"
"4505","If Julieta weren’t such a crushing bore, it might have been a lusty little delight.","42","4326444"
"4506","Judd Apatow brings no cleverness or wit to his one-joke situation, and he can't give it the kernel of credibility that even a low comedy needs to sustain itself for a feature length.","42","405422"
"4507","The lame-o aspects of the whole campy setup are still lame-o.","42","120770"
"4508","If you're the kind of moviegoer who likes puzzling out the plots of insoluble movies, then by all means rush to see Stay, a great big blurry mess.","42","371257"
"4509","The concept is rich with potential to offend yet after a promising opener Cody doesn't seem interested.","42","1262990"
"4510","It's hard to imagine how anyone could sit through this thing except squirming critics and violence addicts in need of a particularly gruesome fix.","42","330793"
"4511","It's a small-minded and jejune film, and it feels strangely out-of-date considering how loaded it is with right-here-right-now signifiers.","42","292644"
"4512","It's too little premise stretched over too much movie, and while the cast gives it their all, Nolfi's characterless direction only makes the movie feel that much slighter.","42","1385826"
"4513","A brain-squandering thriller.","42","1059786"
"4514","This is a strange and indeed foolish film. [29 Apr 1994]","42","106379"
"4515","The movie, a piece of luridly baroque metaphysical trash, is about a Vietnam veteran who keeps getting jolted by demonic visions.","42","99871"
"4516","Though it's debatable whether Sandler is squandered or just supremely annoying here, the film's flaws aren't entirely his fault.","42","185431"
"4517","Dramatically, though, the film is torpid.","42","110148"
"4518","So many body parts from other engineered romantic comedies have been crudely harvested and stitched together in the making of this weird robotic lark that ""Maid of Honor of Frankenstein"" might be more useful a nickname.","42","372532"
"4519","As the coldly calculated Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales proves, it is time to let this series rest in peace, or at the very least, spend the rest of its doomed, immortal days sinking to the bottom of the ocean.","42","1790809"
"4520","Unabashedly pulpy, Rushlights brings to mind the noir cheapies churned out by the studios of Hollywood’s Poverty Row in the early 1950s. It has a few of the better qualities of sub-B noir—above-average camerawork, a rogues gallery of bit players — and all of the flaws.","42","1536437"
"4521","Wally Pfister, best known until now as the cinematographer on Christopher Nolan's big films, makes his directorial debut here, and as dumb as Paglen's script is, Pfister seems to have no feeling whatsoever for the staging of sequences or for any sort of dramatic narrative momentum.","42","2209764"
"4522","The trouble with Gamer is that it’s weird, but not weird enough for the long haul.","42","1034032"
"4523","The winking ethnic jokes weren’t all that revolutionary in the first film, and this time around, they feel even more stale.","42","3760922"
"4524","The only entertainment value is in imagining Turner's apoplexy when he watched Spader having sex with Rosanna Arquette's leg wound.","42","115964"
"4525","Sex and the City, as a film, is a testament to bad faith. It wants its characters to eat their wedding cake and have it, too.","42","1000774"
"4526","Shyamalan has said he wanted to create the best B-movie ever made, but it fails to be the best C movie of the month. (Stuck or Zohan are better C movies.)","42","949731"
"4527","The result is a slack do-over fantasy in which Zac Efron, as a basketball star, looks baffled as to why he hasn't been asked to sing and dance.","42","974661"
"4528","I will give The Nun this, it has an utterly outrageous ending that pretty much brought the house down at the advance screening I attended.","42","5814060"
"4529","The new comedy, The Spy Who Dumped Me, is a mirthless, dead-on-arrival dud.","42","6663582"
"4530","The direction is so heavy-handed that it feels like Parker is afraid audiences don’t know slavery is wrong. Or maybe that truth is all he’s comfortable using Nat Turner to say.","42","4196450"
"4531","The Front Runner is a naively misguided product of panicked, desperate modern times. But perhaps even worse, at least for the type of film it wants to be, it lands somewhere between irrelevant and a woeful misreading of the room.","42","7074886"
"4532","Relentlessly plods from one dour moment to the next, coming to life only in a late-film car chase that takes the possibilities of a world filled with robots to an absurd extreme.","42","986263"
"4533","Maybe if you're younger than 10 you'll be scared or thrilled by this film. Otherwise, be prepared for one of the most unexciting pictures this summer.","42","163025"
"4534","Improbably, this saccharine melodrama comes courtesy of Jason Reitman, the Hollywood scion director who made ""Juno"" and ""Up In The Air."" Clearly, he’s chasing a change of pace, a hard right turn away from the sardonic redemption stories that have previously sported his byline and into the unfamiliar realm of Sirksian soap.","42","1967545"
"4535","There is one bit of good news. For all you abominable snowman fans out there, ""The Mummy"" is filled with yetis. And, boy, are they ever angry.","42","859163"
"4536","It’s shockingly humorless and glacially slow for a film featuring a bendy boy genius, an invisible woman, a human torch, and a talking pile of stones.","42","1502712"
"4537","At some point in their careers, most male actors want to play (a) Hamlet, and (b) a hit man. I hope that Clooney has gotten ""b"" out of his system.","42","1440728"
"4538","A resounding dud.","42","300556"
"4539","The best and creepiest sequence involves a sort of beta test, during which a patchwork chimplike creature is brought to life and rampages about.","42","1976009"
"4540","Beneath The Planet Of The Apes is a joyless retread that at least has the distinction of ending with the nuclear annihilation of Earth.","42","65462"
"4541","Brief moments of brilliance, including a riveting performance by Riseborough and a number of gorgeous frames, only shine with momentary appeal before the whole thing slips back into vapidity and convention.","42","3612126"
"4542","Reeves is a stiff dancer and he delivers his lines in a full leather jacket monotone.","42","204626"
"4543","As an action comedy, it's just a bad trip.","42","910936"
"4544","A lurid hodgepodge of the ''subversive'' and the secondhand, the movie lacks the primal pop pleasures of Lynch's best work.","42","100935"
"4545","Like earlier Dante classics The Gremlins and The Burbs, The Hole marries the fantastical, the horrific, and the mundane, but in this case, the fantastical isn’t that fantastic, the horrific isn’t scary, and the mundane is way too mundane. All the elements are here, they just don’t add up to a satisfying whole.","42","1085779"
"4546","Tucker Max’s only real strengths are his outrageousness and his uncompromising self-confidence, but neither comes into play in this punch-pulling, frankly boring film.","42","1220628"
"4547","A send-up of rap personality in which no one actually has a personality. The joke, alas, is on the movie.","42","328099"
"4548","It takes Hawking getting out of his wheelchair — a sequence as tender as it is tasteless — for The Theory Of Everything to register as anything more than impersonal kitsch. It is the one ballsy moment in an otherwise thoroughly neutered movie.","42","2980516"
"4549","There are flashes of wit -- Speedy Gonzales muttering about political correctness and an arty chase through the Louvre. But there is also random flatulence, a.k.a. the stink of desperation.","42","318155"
"4550","Between its continuous insistence on broad humor and its lack of broader context about the industry period in which Paige came up (she was among the first womens’ wrestlers in WWE to break out when the division gained traction after years of public degradation), Fighting With My Family ultimately reveals itself as a shallow take on a genuinely fascinating story.","42","6513120"
"4551","Judged by the standards of ordinary filmmaking, it's as strange, suggestive, and surreal as other Lynch pictures have been. Judged by the standards of Lynch's own career, however, it's amazingly stale and second-hand… [and] contains not a single moment of genuinely felt emotion. [1 Sept 1992]","42","105665"
"4552","Passengers refuses to really wrestle with the compelling questions at its core, instead opting to lean on Lawrence and Pratt’s collective charm to keep things ticking amiably along.","42","1355644"
"4553","Smart enough to put much of its weight on Gallner, a lively presence with a terrifically sour mug that makes him look like a mutual cousin of Willem Dafoe and Peter Lorre.","42","492044"
"4554","When, in its eventful final act, Merhige finally reveals what this thing is REALLY all about, it comes not with any blissful storytelling satisfaction but a grinding sense that this strange movie is a structural mess.","42","324127"
"4555","The big goofball relies too much on the funny hair and swingin' postures of the era as punchlines in themselves.","42","839980"

"4558","Bright gestures vaguely at an allegory about police brutality and race, which may have been more impactful in the original script. It’s hard to tell. For his part, Landis has largely disowned the final product, which buries some glimmers of interesting ideas under a thick layer of adolescent tough-guy posturing.","42","5519340"
"4559","Ultimately Beauty And The Beast feels like a cynical rehash seemingly created just to make a fiscal year sound promising to shareholders. This is a product that’s more manufactured than inspired.","42","2771200"
"4560","It's a solemnly preposterous piece of designer revenge pulp, with actors who stand around bathed in red and blue light like David Lynch mannequins in between scenes of torture and murder.","42","1602613"
"4561","Rather than focusing on a cataclysmic showdown between pop culture's most famous men in tights, Zack Snyder's flashy, cacophonous follow-up to 2013's ""Man of Steel"" is basically one long teaser for the next installment.","42","2975590"
"4562","How about Resident Evil: Game Over?","42","432021"
"4563","This rendering of the turbulent second marriage of England's King Henry VIII proves too heavy-footed for the old movie two-step of setting up a morality tale, then exploiting it for heat and titillation.","42","467200"
"4564","There’s a good movie in Brittain’s story, but you wouldn’t know it from this lethargic, BBC-produced bore.","42","1441953"
"4565","Norbit might have worked if it had fully committed to being over the top or made Rasputia the lead character and found the human inside the cartoon. Instead, the movie doesn't give us anyone to care about.","42","477051"
"4566","There is no reason why Reservation Road could not have been great. George has co-written some powerful films in the past, including two for Daniel Day-Lewis, ""In the Name of the Father"" and ""The Boxer."" He is not wrong to want to mainline intensity here, but the inner lives of these men have not been explored, only displayed.","42","831884"
"4567","What damage could Michael Bay inflict on Jason Voorhees that earlier producers hadn't already inflicted on everyone's favorite hockey-masked serial killer? Well, Bay could make Jason Voorhees ... boring.","42","758746"
"4568","The film suggests Titanic in a giant wading pool.","42","120696"
"4569","Strangely, this Thatcher biopic might have been far more worthwhile if it wasn't about Thatcher: The aged, dotty stranger hanging out with her dead husband is a more compelling subject.","42","1007029"
"4570","The movie is so apolitical; there could have been a nice slant to the movie, about how both sides of the aisle could get together to kick out these Korean terrorists. Instead, it remains totally void.","42","2302755"

"4572","Nobody feels anything they're not explicitly told to feel. Not even the audience.","42","822849"
"4573","This final act goes on far too long and devolves into such a miasma of pap that it's clear Stoller had no idea how to wrap things up.","42","1226229"
"4574","Jinxed itself into being nothing but an inane popcorn flick pretending to be edgy.","42","244244"
"4575","Leonetti doesn't seem to have any particular knack for the staging of suspense or fear.","42","3322940"
"4576","The only reason to take such a uniquely Japanese story and transplant it to Seattle is to explore how its thorny moral questions might inspire different answers in an American context, so for this retread to all but reduce America to its whiteness indicates an absence of context more than anything else. It’s the most glaring symptom of a film that utterly fails to investigate its premise.","42","1241317"
"4577","Horror remakes don’t have to be inferior rehashes, as films like Jim Mickle’s ""We Are What We Are"" (2013) and Luca Guadagnino’s ""Suspiria"" (2018) have demonstrated. But this Rabid nibbles where it should clamp down hard.","42","5628902"
"4578","The three main narratives cut back and forth between New York, Paris, and Rome, which is the best thing the movie has going for it: picturesque locations. Unfortunately, by the time we're done taking in the sights and Haggis finally coughs up his third-act puzzle-box twist, it comes off as a big metaphysical So What.","42","2343793"
"4579","It’s got some talented actors and a certain jagged inner-city atmosphere, yet this first feature directed by Mario Van Peebles (son of the veteran black director Melvin Van Peebles) is little more than a sketchy exploitation melodrama.","42","102526"
"4580","Sure, there's a bit of spectacle to the film's utterly ridiculous violence. Even that dulls, however, without character or stakes to inject urgency into the parade of broken bodies.","42","3072482"
"4581","A limp and sodden downer.","42","120824"
"4582","It's a lot easier to follow than ""Syriana."" But intelligibility is about the only thing this international thriller has going for it.","42","758774"
"4583","Ready to Wear is messy and vaguely nasty -- a blur with attitude.","42","110907"
"4584","It's very flimsy, the harrowingly unoriginal screenplay rings false in almost every dialogue exchange, and first-time director Lesli Linka Glatter paints her scenes with the broadest of strokes and a clunky, heavy-handed, TV sitcom sensibility. [20 Oct 1995]","42","114011"
"4585","It's not just that Tony Soprano is richer, darker, cooler, and scarier. The dude gets more laughs.","42","289848"

"4587","The film never kicks in as a character study or a star vehicle.","42","363988"
"4588","The Boss can at least be appreciated for trying to lead its main character on an honest-to-god arc, which is more than many loosey-goosey movies of its ilk can say.","42","2702724"

"4590","Blandly directed by ""The Devil Wears Prada""-helmed David Frankel, One Chance lacks the middlebrow polish that has made his films such reliably re-watchable cable-TV fodder.","42","1196956"
"4591","It's no coincidence that The Box plays like the world's murkiest Twilight Zone episode. It's loosely based on ''Button, Button,'' a short story by Richard Matheson, who wrote some of the series' greatest scripts.","42","362478"
"4592","It’s disappointingly ho-hum, without the spectacular — and often very funny — special effects that have become the hallmark of this series.","42","101917"

"4594","It's a dull film.","42","455944"
"4595","Like a dog walking on its hind legs across a freshly waxed floor -- awkward, slow, deliberate, seeking approval -- the action thriller Reign of Fire gets from start to finish, somehow, without tumbling into complete disaster.","42","253556"
"4596","Even as they've smoothed the novel's rough edges, moreover, the filmmakers have tried to cram a maximum number of its incidents into about two hours of screen time. This gives the picture a hectic pace that adds to its feeling of weightlessness and unreality. Poor casting, especially in the major roles played by Tom Hanks and Melanie Griffith, doesn't help.","42","99165"
"4597","Frey didn't really need a ghostwriter for this story, he just needed an archivist with a Xerox machine and a mercenary streak.","42","1464540"

"4599","Filmmaker Jared Hess (who cowrote the script with his wife, Jerusha Hess) installs Napoleon front and center as a punchline in and of himself -- and as that dispiriting product of narrative defeat, a symbol.","42","374900"
"4600","Whereas Laugier’s creation forces the viewer to endure and consider every punch, kick, slap, and slice inflicted upon the female protagonists, the Goetz version prefers to shy away from or downplay the brutality, which results in the rare case of a film suffering from gore deficiency.","42","1663655"
"4601","In just about every way, the film is an inferior sequel — dumber, flatter, lacking even the barbaric extremity of its predecessor. Where’s a flesh-eating Elijah Wood when you need him?","42","458481"
"4602","Without a marriage of inspired storytelling, straight up regurgitation doesn’t elevate new tech. Also, thinking about could and should, one needs to consider good taste, but that’s clearly not driving any of the decisions here.","42","6105098"
"4603","There's not an authentically scary moment in it.","42","145531"
"4604","It's a cartoon that thinks it isn't one.","42","804461"
"4605","The film looks great, with vivid colors and sharp, snappy staging, but its 92 minutes drag by interminably. Tim Curry in fishnets might have helped, but a coherent storyline would have been far better.","42","83067"
"4606","The movie's one saving grace is Olyphant (""Live Free and Die Hard,"" HBO's ""Deadwood""), whose sociopathic elegance is gradually winning, and whose dry, monotonic, Eastwood-like delivery of one-liners is frequently, if perhaps unintentionally, very funny.","42","465494"
"4607","Year One isn't dreadful; it just isn't nearly as funny as it hopes to be.","42","1045778"
"4608","This is certainly the talkiest of the seven films in the series and Craven never comes close to convincing us this could all be true. [14 Oct 1994, p.10]","42","111686"
"4609","Far too often, the film has to submit to the inevitable and stop so that Affleck can struggle like a yoga student to bend his face into a human emotion. He even cries. So might you.","42","287978"
"4610","The set-up is ridiculously long and unfulfilling, the energy of Soderbergh’s originals recreated less skillfully, and an over-reliance on twists feel like empty rewards, to be easily scrutinized afterward.","42","5164214"
"4611","So much flatter than it was on the comic-book page.","42","259324"
"4612","The film’s flaws aside (those will come later), Blunt’s performance is a hell of a thing, wholly lacking in vanity and brimming with honest, ugly feeling.","42","3631112"
"4613","Mostly about the prospect of getting your skin ripped by fishhooks.","42","104409"
"4614","With 22 July, Greengrass pushes up against the boundaries of respectful representation, traipsing queasily close to outright exploitation with his reenactment of the 2011 Norway terrorist attacks, which claimed the lives of 77 people, many of them children.","42","7280898"
"4615","This vampire story is as soulless as they get.","42","187738"
"4616","Much like “It: Chapter Two,” Doctor Sleep is an odd generic blend. Part horror, part fantasy, part “The Shining” Oscars tribute, it engenders confusion more often than delight.","42","5606664"
"4617","It recalls a kind of French farce that assumes its audiences want to see the rich suffer. [18 May 1991]","42","103241"
"4618","Earnestly ersatz down to every spangle, dance move, plot turn, and line of hokum dialogue, Burlesque is a showbiz pic for these American Idol times - a time when we agree to pretend that mediocre mimicry of better artists is good enough to keep us entertained. We agree to pretend that quality is in the eye and ear of the undemanding beholder.","42","1126591"
"4619","A flat, heebie jeebies thriller.","42","229260"
"4620","Mighty Joe Young is based on the 1949 film of the same name, and it's nominally more aware of '90s concerns: destruction of the gorillas' habitats, illegal hunting, trade in animal body parts. On the other hand, it's no more enlightened about the intrinsic value of these clever, emotionally complex creatures. [25 Dec 1998, p.13E]","42","120751"
"4621","There's hardly a shot in the film where Chase doesn't try to swallow the camera with one broad expression or another, and Vacation follows in turn, laboring too hard to drive every punchline home.","42","85995"
"4622","A hopelessly stupid movie that should appeal to baked couch potatoes everywhere.","42","113749"
"4623","The Kings Of Summer doesn’t take itself seriously; short of having the actors break character, it’ll do anything for a laugh. It leans heavily on interminable improv scenes and interminable montages edited from improv scenes. In other words, much of it plays like the outtakes reel that would be shown at the wrap party of a better, more tightly structured film.","42","2179116"
"4624","Focusing on cultural references and social cues, About Alex fails to give us a big picture compelling enough to overlook its flaws.","42","2667918"
"4625","Turns the franchise into a terrible '80s comedy.","42","418279"
"4626","Fans of horror-comedy probably will enjoy this movie, even though chuckles outnumber scares.","42","426459"
"4627","The film becomes so self-aware that it’s tough to discern whether we should take what’s happening seriously or not.","42","5884230"
"4628","The bad news is that Ferrell's modestly likable performance is the ONLY good thing about this misguided comedy that's so tiresomely written, badly acted by a stellar cast and ploddingly directed (by art-house whiz Marc Forster) that it just never quite gets off the ground.","42","420223"
"4629","The Conspirator should skip theaters altogether and become the first film released straight to middle-school history classes, where the standards for what can generously be deemed entertainment are much lower.","42","968264"

"4632","It probably won't matter to its core audience that The A-Team doesn't make a lick of sense.","42","429493"
"4633","It turns out bigger is not better. Bigger is louder, you bet your pounding eardrums it is, but it's not smarter. More teeth aren't sharper. They're dull, and so is Jurassic World.","42","369610"
"4634","Its B-movie sins are many, worst among them an icy hero and a plot that feels like it was built from relics of other, better films.","42","822847"
"4635","The best you can say about Owen is that no actor has looked better in thigh-high boots and puffed-out britches.","42","414055"
"4636","It's not particularly funny or moving and it's terribly self-indulgent. Flamboyance and cartoonishness rule, there's hardly a moment of genuine emotion, and most overtures in that direction are superficial. As a picture ostensibly about love, revenge and the ugliness of slavery, Django Unchained has almost zero subtext and is a largely soulless bloodbath, in which the history of pain and retribution is coupled carelessly with a cool soundtrack and some verbose dialogue. Though it might just entertain the sh.t out of the less discerning.","42","1853728"
"4637","A film that's prescient and mind-bogglingly ill-conceived in roughly equal measures...Strange Days is the cinematic equivalent of trip-hop, a shadowy realm of atmosphere, mood and suggestion with a decidedly drugged-up, post-apocalyptic feel. But the many things Strange Days gets right are negated by the things it gets wrong.","42","114558"
"4638","The Hollars deals in weighty personal tragedies, and yet neither the treacly, offbeat humor nor the moments of more straightforward pathos tend to work for any real length of time.","42","3714720"
"4639","Now it's just some thin chick in her underwear, kicking butt.","42","1242432"
"4640","Save for a few clever twists and winning performances from O’Shea Jackson Jr. and 50 Cent (née Curtis Jackson), Den of Thieves is the kind of bloated crime thriller that could have been made in any decade — which is not to call it timeless so much as way past its time.","42","1259528"
"4641","Skyscraper plays out like a metaphor for diminishing returns — Johnson keeps climbing, higher and higher, until there’s nowhere left to go but down.","42","5758778"
"4642","Its lack of both originality and any real memorable moments feels shameless and lazy. Adding insult, the movie ends on a cliffhanger, guaranteeing that Insidious: Chapter 3 will soon be coming to a theater near you.","42","2226417"
"4643","Breathe seems to want nothing more than to be ""The Theory Of Everything"" for a slightly newer generation.","42","5716464"
"4644","Taken's subject matter is too serious for an escapist chop-socky movie, and the sleazy, exploitative tone undercuts the thrills.","42","936501"
"4645","Milla Jovovich slinks cartoonishly as Stone's seductive wife, on a mission to compromise the lawman. Lordy.","42","1423995"
"4646","If you expect anything more substantive from a movie - characters of more than one dimension, storylines that at the least play new riffs on old themes, plot developments that flow from the narrative - you'd best look elsewhere.","42","417217"
"4647","Like most self-conscious attempts at a “midnight movie,” Tusk lacks the conviction that would make it anything more than an outré curiosity; it’s essentially a filmed dare, combined with fan service.","42","3099498"
"4648","This retread has been bloated far beyond its B-movie origins, beefed up with more characters and an all-star cast, stripped of any real suspense and loaded down with music cuts and one-liners aimed at pleasing a crowd of rowdy male teenagers.","42","187078"
"4649","The antics involving ghosts, chases, and burping that divert the small fry don't mix with the jokey, tribute-band dialogue spouting from the Mystery, Inc. gang.","42","267913"

"4653","Though the movie, which was adapted from a book written by Christopher Paolini when he was a teenager, aims high by ripping off the classics (even down to Eragon’s murdered uncle), what it most recalls are the cheesy lost sword-and-sorcery epics from the '80s, awful movies in the vein of ""Yor: The Hunter From the Future"" and ""The Blade Master.""","42","449010"
"4654","Rather than forge a believable relationship between Grace and Del that stokes our interest in the future, this uneasy two-hander strings us along by raising dull questions about the past.","42","6169694"
"4655","Anderson and Day-Lewis strip themselves of their natural talents for invention and poetry, as if any hint of romance, nobility or fun would soften the film.","42","469494"
"4656","The filmmaking is TV-movie-of-the-week dull and Robinson’s ordeal is hammered home to the exclusion of virtually everything else in his life.","42","453562"
"4657","In spite of its wealth of conflict, New Moon suffers from a dearth of accompanying tension and excitement, thanks to the increasingly tedious relationship at its center.","42","1259571"
"4658","Full of gratuitous sexual innuendoes and death-defying closeups of Playboy covergirl Anna Nicole Smith's anatomy, the film lacks most of the zest that made the original so tasty. [18 Mar 1994, p.6]","42","110622"
"4659","The cumulative effect of the movie is repulsive and depressing.","42","235737"

"4667","The early-’60s styles are chic, the Euro locales are swank, and the music cues (including a nod to Ennio Morricone’s Once Upon a Time in the West score) are fantastic. Too bad the plot and the lead performances are so lifeless.","42","1638355"
"4668","One of the many, many things wrong with Joe Wright's Anna Karenina, starring Keira Knightley as literature's most famous adulteress – take that, Emma Bovary! – is that one never feels the love. It's a conceit in search of a movie. It could just as easily have been titled ""Décor.""","42","1781769"
"4669","Here's a romance without a spark of excitement.","42","132512"
"4670","Wan, a director who’s proven himself to be a can’t-miss ace regardless of genre (from the horror formulas of The Conjuring and Insidious to the big-budget tentpole mayhem of Furious 7) seems to finally be out of his depth. He’s conjured an intriguing world, but populated that world with dramatic cotton candy and silly characters, including a hero who’s unsure if he wants to make us laugh or feel — and winds up doing neither. Pass the Dramamine.","42","1477834"

"4673","Rife with stereotypes, a terrible script, and odd “300”-esque cinematography that just doesn’t fit, this is not only a film nobody asked for, but also one that nobody should be forced to endure.","42","4532826"
"4674","Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby has the hallmarks of a contemporary Hollywood spectacle. It's missing the explosions, but make no mistake: Gatsby is one glitzy misfire.","42","1343092"
"4675","What kind of picture is it? Big, certainly: IMAX-scaled, and a hefty 150 minutes even after a visibly ruthless edit. It’s clever, too — yes, the palindromic title has some narrative correlation — albeit in an exhausting, rather joyless way. As second comings go, Tenet is like witnessing a Sermon on the Mount preached by a savior who speaks exclusively in dour, drawn-out riddles. Any awe is flattened by follow-up questions.","42","6723592"
"4676","A cover version is pretty much what this do-over of The Gambler represents, with the rougher edges mixed out and sweetened. It's no mystery why actors and directors want to relive the magic of American studio movies from the fabled 1970s, but if you're not going to take the risks that the originals did, or illuminate as much about the characters, why redo them at all?","43","2039393"
"4677","Unlike “Spy,” which took great pains to make its cloak-and-dagger shenanigans as exciting, and thematically meaningful, as the raucous comedy around it, A Simple Favor is like two different movies, a sophisticated sisterhood lark you want more of, and a ho-hum buried-secrets murder mystery getting in the way of your good time.","43","7040874"
"4678","The first third of Alien: Covenant is suitably gripping. The final third is wreathed in tension reminiscent of the film’s 1979 progenitor, Alien. The second third sandwiched in between these bookends is equally interminable and dumb, a garbage-level studio-prompted exercise in origin narrative, built to demystify intellectual property where mystification is a key factor in its success.","43","2316204"
"4679","Like a servant to two masters, “Stephen King’s Doctor Sleep” wants both Stephen King and fans of Stanley Kubrick’s 1980 film of his book “The Shining” to be happy. But sadly, it isn’t enough of its own chilling entity to have much impact.","43","5606664"
"4680","The picture, a would-be thriller, is a mechanical exercise from the get-go, one that positively defies suspension of disbelief with each succeeding twist of a plot no one would ever hatch in real life.","44","184858"

"4682","Whatever extraordinary ingredients are necessary to fashion a 1776 home run, this movie doesn't have them.","44","187393"
"4683","This is a rare misstep for Russell, who in the past has sold us on all kinds of stories, whether they’re as indescribable as “I Heart Huckabee’s” or as traditional as “The Fighter.” Unlike his indefatigable heroine, however, Russell just can’t seem to close the deal on Joy.","45","2446980"

"4686","Disobedience finishes on an annoyingly vague note, almost as if Lelio and Lenkiewicz had stumbled on a more interesting, expansive narrative in the final act but didn’t quite know how to pursue it. The result is a film that, from beginning to end, feels as hopelessly lost as its characters do.","45","6108178"
"4687","There is no sense of real danger, because the mission has to continue, if only to keep this impressive long shot going. Any time there’s a larger, more cataclysmic set piece, our heroes look like tiny chess pieces on a much bigger board, bystanders who move around exploding mortars and whizzing bullets to produce the most stunning tableaux possible.","45","8579674"
"4688","The film feels half-formed, sometimes trying to be raucously confrontational, other times excessively sedate.","45","6018306"

"4695","As Joker gets grimmer and descends further into bloody violence, it becomes little more than a horror show, bludgeoning its viewers out of any chance at insight.","45","7286456"
"4696","Though Chalamet and Hammer are up to the task of communicating a competition of desire with as few words as possible, they offer up a dare and a proposition that Guadagnino and his film never fully take on. Maybe they’re afraid of the consequences.","45","5726616"
"4697","There’s a goofy spree of a movie buried deep within Sausage Party, but it’s missing both the spree and the goofs. This comedy needed to be a lot smarter if it wanted to succeed at being this stupid.","45","1700841"
"4698","The movie's look is artificially grainy, and most of the scenes are encrusted with CGI - you'd have to chip it away with a chisel to get to anything human or interesting or even remotely fantastical.","45","816462"
"4699","Though Garland’s film is decidedly creepy and often ravishing to look at, it’s hard to shake the sense that, beneath its highbrow patina, it is an intellectual muddle.","45","2798920"
"4700","The directors can make it fluid, comprehensible and gorgeous to look at, but they can't keep what struck many readers as profound on the page, from seeming profoundly obvious on screen, especially when every point gets reiterated six times.","45","1371111"
"4701","Too earnest and dour to be a silly bit of summer fun, but it's not exactly scientifically sound, either.","45","1318514"
"4702","Based on a graphic novel, Cowboys & Aliens never quite transcends the flat dimensions of its source material.","45","409847"
"4703","Idiotic, if reasonably kinetic, Eagle Eye -- in which Shia LaBeouf and Michelle Monaghan spend the better part of two hours urgently answering phone calls and dodging hurtling machinery -- is every bit as over-edited as it is under-thunk.","45","1059786"
"4704","At its best, My Friend Dahmer makes some weak attempts to reckon with virulent homophobia in an Ohio suburb in the late ‘70s. But for the most part, it’s just a movie about the sick thrill of watching someone become progressively stranger and then a murderer.","45","2291540"
"4705","When faced with the choice of which gag to go for, Horrible Bosses generally selects the raunchiest laugh possible, all other considerations be damned.","45","1499658"
"4706","There are moments in Hold the Dark, none of them directly related to the plot, that are just as unsettling and searing as the best moments of Blue Ruin and Green Room. Still, the film never coheres outside of those flashes, ultimately delivering a disappointing, confusing, but undeniably fascinating experience.","45","5057140"
"4707","This slackers-go-gangsta comedy demonstrates that less than 90 minutes can be a very long time.","45","1622547"
"4708","This new mainly live-action Disney version of the oft-told story directed by Bill Condon feels largely perfunctory. Where it flounders most is on the miscasting of several crucial roles.","45","2771200"
"4709","Your enjoyment - if that's the right word - of Buried will hinge on two things: Your ability to tolerate situations in which characters are confined to very tight spaces, and your willingness to be emotionally manipulated in the cheapest way imaginable.","45","1462758"
"4710","Some of us wonder, still, how Margaret Thatcher can continue to live with herself. Watching Meryl Streep walk around so ably in Thatcher's skin isn't enlightening; it's more like a living nightmare.","45","1007029"
"4711","Crammed with interesting ideas, visuals, and people, but Stone buries it all in a s--tstorm of technique.","45","146838"
"4712","Director Neil Burger, whose last divergent character was the smart-drugged protagonist of Limitless, allocates more than enough of this overlong movie to details of life and society in future-Chicagoland. But he fails to make any aspect of the premise persuasive.","45","1840309"
"4713","It never feels complete or thought through enough, either as a story or more crucially, an emotional experience — which is exactly what audiences would need in order to want to see more.","45","6017942"
"4714","Say this for Roland Emmerich's latest movie: It IS a disaster.","45","1190080"
"4715","It's tailored more to a gamer's eyes and expectations than a moviegoer's. On the whole the scenes play like levels, with one connecting in only the most basic way to the next.","45","1464540"
"4716","A movie that delights with spectacle as much as it repels with revisionism. Part of you will enjoy it. Another part of you will hate the part of you that enjoys it.","45","1485796"
"4717","All in all, the weaknesses and strengths of this remake boil down to the unavoidable fact that Force Majeure, a film I’ve seen multiple times and consider one of the best of its decade, isn’t a work that can be improved upon.","45","4558376"
"4718","Layton’s failure is frustrating. American Animals is a rare thing, truth that’s legitimately stranger than fiction. Bereft of a cohesive structure, the movie loses purpose, and that rare, strange truth is lost in workaday heist tropes blended with workaday documentary portraiture.","45","6212478"
"4719","Every actor in Friends with Benefits, including the nearly indestructible Patricia Clarkson and Richard Jenkins, stalls out in the process of pedaling desperately to make this substandard material work.","45","1632708"
"4720","In the early scenes of Larry Crowne, Hanks' Larry is so assertively regular he almost comes off as a special-needs child - grinning into his coffee-cup in the big-box-store break room, he has all the sexual allure of Forrest Gump.","45","1583420"
"4721","It’s a straightforward retelling with a confusing design philosophy, disappointing action sequences, weak storytelling and a cast which clearly deserved better material.","45","4532826"
"4722","A dark, dreary and dull “Mad Max in Neutral” from director David Michôd (“Animal Kingdom”) that tries to pass off its blunt narrative and repetitiveness as some sort of style.","46","2345737"
"4723","This is a universally powerful story, with terrific songs and countless funny and fascinating supporting characters. It’s a classic of performance and sensation. This version, seemingly by design—like that was the damned plan all along—drains every bit of life from it … in order to make it more “realistic.”","47","6105098"
"4724","Palpably well-intentioned, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is nevertheless phony to the core.","48","359950"
"4725","The single-minded simplicity of its plotting can at times be an asset rather than a hindrance; in a summer even more bogged down by needless sequels and remakes than most, Crawl is, at the very least, a lean thriller that isn’t based on an existing property.","48","8364368"
"4726","The movie focuses so intently on technical craft that it sometimes zones right out. Hawley is still stretching boundaries, often literally, while disregarding the human experiences they’re supposed to contain.","48","4682804"
"4727","The stars certainly aren’t acting like their participation is a mercenary endeavor. Lawrence and Smith seem to enjoy their goofy-meets-gung-ho responsibilities, and that counts for something in these types of movies, as is a tone decidedly less mean-spirited than the last one’s, and a central car/motorcycle/helicopter chase that distracts you with thrills rather than wear you down with overkill.","48","1502397"
"4728","The Aeronauts is a film flawed from its first concept. By blending fact and fiction so freely, Thorne and Harper turned a story of scientific discovery into a muddling romantic adventure that crashes and burns.","48","6141246"
"4729","For all the technical achievement on display, as impressive as it is that you could recast a main role in so short amount of time, All the Money in the World is disjointed and frazzled.","49","5294550"
"4730","Li's light touch and explosive fighting skills deserve a better vehicle than this overcooked pot of New Jack suey.","49","165929"
"4731","In its best moments, Suburbicon is the dark, truly funny examination of 1950s suburbia it wants to be. These moments, however, are all too rare and more often than not the story is just a flat Film Noir tale purporting to expose the evil that lurks all around us.","49","491175"
"4732","Never the heart-wrenching emotional experience it seems intended to be.","49","180093"
"4733","Director Josh Trank, whose debut feature “Chronicle” put a smart new spin on superhero tropes, has assembled a quartet of engaging, charismatic performers and stranded them in a miasma of exposition and set-up that sinks the movie.","49","1502712"

"4735","Pop-music biopics have a great history, but 8 Mile is for Eminem fans only. They're sure to make it a huge, huge hit.","50","298203"
"4736","The film's biggest (and saddest) crime is malaise - it's not that John Carter doesn't care about what it's doing, it just can't make us care, even though the magnitude of every event, conflict and emotion is as melodramatic as its Victorian roots.","50","401729"
"4737","The acting is fine. The ensemble is strong. The story moves along. Yet a coating of sleaze clings to the film, like bread dipped in batter.","50","144214"
"4738","No, Sony Animation should not have let Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse out its doors and onto big screens in this blurred, jerky, pixelated condition.","50","4633694"
"4739","Eastwood, ironically, is the weak link in the cast, a less-than-ideal choice to play a screw-up who squeaks through life on personal magnetism: He's got star quality, sure, even a certain remote sexiness, but he's no charmer.","50","139668"
"4740","The film is perceptive and shrewd about such matters as the awkwardness of two kinds of aristocracy and power brought face to face. But ""Hyde Park"" never catches fire.","50","1477855"
"4741","Yes, it's all pretty silly. But for those who can stand the annoyance of the cardboard glasses, there are worse ways to kill a hot afternoon. [23 July 1983, p.D6]","50","85750"

"4743","Sure, it’s kind of entertaining to see the studly, studious Mortensen slap on a few pounds and go way out with the fuggeddaboutit talk as he tries to shoot the shit with Ali’s pedantic, closeted virtuoso. It’s the first time I’ve ever seen him ham it up. But the leads mostly are saddled with literal, middle-of-the-road material.","50","6966692"
"4744","The script, although endearing, is too poorly edited to lift its quirks to the next level, no matter how many stars show up for roll call.","50","3471098"
"4745","Betty White is what makes this film memorable as Andrew’s grandmother. She steals every scene, and adds the sweetness that a film like this needs.","50","1041829"
"4746","It's a dear and corny story, played with lovable grubbiness by Sally Field and Ron Leibman.","50","79638"
"4747","Effective enough as a cautionary tale about willful ignorance and as a showcase for Will Smith...the film is let down by its confused and cliche-riddled screenplay, which struggles mightily to take a complex story and finesse it to fit story beats it was never meant to hit.","50","3322364"
"4748","Kline, in particular, has the spark and know-how to overcome some awfully belabored writing and situations.","50","264796"
"4749","Without Christopher Plummer, All the Money in the World would be an absolute bore.","50","5294550"
"4750","Exactly the kind of thing most of us have in mind when we think ""popcorn movie."" It's largely brainless, pretty to look at, and produced solely as a lead-in to another moneymaking sequel for Disney.","50","383574"
"4751","In the utterly routine effort Skyfall, we're actually expected to cheer each chord we've heard so many times (here's a martini shaker! Look, it's a Walther PPK! And there's an Aston Martin!) We've been turned into wretched Pavlovian dogs, salivating at the bell instead of the snack. The highlight, by far, is a classic animated credit sequence: Adele, you are the new Shirley Bassey.","50","1074638"
"4752","While Extract is mildly amusing and a slice of a mostly working-class world that doesn't make it into comedy that much anymore, it's not completely convincing as a movie.","50","1225822"
"4753","The screenplay is foolish and Michael Keaton overplays the title role badly, but director Tim Burton gives the comedy a heap of visual imagination. [22 Apr 1988]","50","94721"
"4754","By the time Donner crowds his climactic poker game with a bevy of veteran Western character actors, decades of movie tradition have been reduced to window dressing, and Maverick leaves you hungry for the real thing.","50","110478"
"4755","Perhaps the real question, then, isn't how you update Spider-Man but why you would even try. Introduced in 1962, the original superhero helped to initiate the age of modern comics. Raimi hasn't figured out how to reconfigure him for the blockbuster age, and there are suggestions.","50","145487"
"4756","Fans of the series may be disappointed to see so little of Barker's sadistic Cenobites, but while they're used sparingly, they're used to good effect.","50","274546"
"4757","The Terminal is highly crafted whimsy; it lacks any compelling reason to exist, and its love story is a dud. Ever bashful when it comes to boy-girl stuff, Spielberg has structured the relationship between Amelia and Viktor to be as asexual as possible.","50","362227"
"4758","For all its showmanship, Now You See Me has a lot less up its sleeve than it lets on.","50","1670345"
"4759","The plot is more of the same old running and screaming, but Weaver is worth the price of admission all by herself, which is just as well in light of the less-than-fleshed out characters by whom she's surrounded.","50","118583"
"4760","Highlander: The Final Dimension is elementary and vague, but this purportedly last installment works well enough on a comic book level. Music video veteran Andy Morahan, in his feature directorial debut, has the right idea: Go for as much energy, pace and visual panache as possible. [30 Jan 1995, p.F8]","50","110027"
"4761","The dialogue is dumber than dirt, and the plot crumbles at the halfway mark, but the movie does what a loud summer blockbuster should, which is loudly bust blocks.","50","1424381"
"4762","Visually flat and uninteresting and too often feels like a (leisurely paced) filmed play.","50","203230"
"4763","The idea that there is evil under the sun and amongst the verities out there in the clean-living heartland is not exactly new to fiction. Neither is the one about the bad seeds, the homicidal children. In combination, however -- the combination in Children of the Corn-- the elements have a perverse novelty. [19 Mar 1984, p.C6]","50","87050"
"4764","Sure, the movie causes a few jumps. But they are the cinematic equivalent of having someone jump out from behind a door and yell boo. [23 July 1999, p.E1]","50","171363"
"4765","In The Bounty Hunter, the couple that foils a bunch of tiresome grade-C thriller goons together stays together. Whether or not that's a recipe for love, it's certainly not a formula for romantic-comedy magic.","50","1038919"
"4766","Predictable, rarely scary.","50","160484"
"4767","There are no real stakes, and I find the attempts at creating suspense to be almost offensive. Irritating, at the very least.","50","3263904"
"4768","Medusa, at least, is fun to watch, and, as a bonus, we in the audience don’t have to worry about turning to stone (although, watching this film, your eyelids do get awfully heavy).","50","800320"
"4769","Lane gives the film her best shot; she's pretty much the only reason to see it. There's an intelligence mixed with ferocity that makes her performance compelling, far-more-so than anything else in the film.","50","880578"
"4770","Sean Penn’s Into the Wild is certainly visual--it’s entirely too visual, to the point of being cheaply lyrical.","50","758758"
"4771","The care that Mr. Friedkin and Mr. Blatty have taken with the physical production, and with the rhythm of the narrative, which achieves a certain momentum through a lot of fancy, splintery crosscutting, is obviously intended to persuade us to suspend belief. But to what end? To marvel at the extent to which audiences will go to escape boredom by shock and insult.","50","70047"
"4772","Bites may have a bit more on its mind, but it never equals even the weakest scene in Cameron Crowe's ""Singles"". [18 Feb 1994, p.5D]","50","110950"
"4773","There are multiple murders and two gory scenes, but if you love getting scared, then you'll enjoy this thrill ride.","50","120082"
"4774","A stolid film that largely rests on its director’s competence at helming extravagant aerial views of pyrotechnic destruction.","50","6924650"
"4775","Sadly, if this movie was a fight, they'd have stopped it.","50","165929"
"4776","Bursting with potential that never gets realized.","50","762125"
"4777","Scrooged works in fits and starts. The mundane demands of the sentimental story keep interrupting what are, essentially, revue sketches, a few of which are hilarious.","50","96061"
"4778","Delivers enough action to please Saturday-night crowds, if not the surreal wit that made the first two ""Batman"" movies, directed by Tim Burton, so entertaining.","50","372784"
"4779","A movie of slick, surface-level pleasures that’s unpersuasive at its core.","50","2039393"
"4780","Even tots may emerge feeling slightly browbeaten by this colorful, strenuous and hyperactive fantasy, which has moments of charm and beauty but often resembles an exploding toy factory rather than a work of honest enchantment.","50","1446192"
"4781","The overall effect is about the same -- slow start, then escalating suspense and violence. Today's shock-movie fans will enjoy shrieking at it, and others should skip it. In space, no one can hear you ask for your money back.","50","78748"
"4782","Jodie Foster and Terrence Howard are incredibly compelling and hold your attention despite Jordan's deliberately slow pacing.","50","476964"
"4783","So like much of this film, the viewer is turned into an observer. You never feel close enough to the action, either in the ring or in the kitchens, living rooms and tough streets where the story takes place. The characters engage you up to a point but never really pull you in.","50","964517"
"4784","When it comes to retelling the tale of Tristan and Isolde, give us a movie that makes love. Or even a movie that makes war. Anything, just anything, but a movie that makes nice.","50","375154"
"4785","Since the film is based on the Atari video game of the same name, it also has much to appeal to headbangers: fast pace, lots of gadgets, monsters, explosive special effects, plenty of inscrutable plot twists and turns.","50","369226"
"4786","All performances remain irrelevant in the face of such expensive, explosive combat and destruction, and there the film excels: You will feel blown back into your seat, starting 40 seconds into the story.","50","1663662"
"4787","Aspiring to evoke an unreal city stranded in the autumn of the soul, the film succeeds only when it peers up from the intro-philosophy book for the occasional glimpse of everyday beauty.","50","268690"
"4788","The Shape of Water has been made with a level of craftsmanship that should be the envy of most filmmakers, but the impudent, unruly streak that so often gives Guillermo del Toro’s films their pulse has been airbrushed away.","50","5580390"
"4789","Becca and Howie's extracurricular relationships are the saving grace of a movie that's otherwise a sledgehammer of plot and score.","50","935075"
"4790","Rusnak, who was the second-unit director of ""Godzilla,"" brings plenty of style to this ambitious yet utterly anticlimactic thumb-sucker.","50","139809"
"4791","It's a genial and mostly well-crafted picture, if hardly one that breaks new ground. [27 Aug 1993, p.L21]","50","108327"
"4792","If the Star Wars movies have taught us anything, it's that waiting 20 years for a new sequel by a guy named George can lead to disappointment.","50","418819"
"4793","The story is achingly familiar, and though Stallone has a certain power, he is certainly not the subtlest actor to crawl out from under Marlon's overcoat. But the picture goes most wrong in the conceit it employs to lift Rocky out of the clubs and into the big arena for his title challenge.","50","75148"
"4794","What Laika achieves is an effective mixture of hyper-real and hyper-stylized, a combination that keeps “Kubo” appealing to the eye for audiences of all ages. If the film’s plotting and dialogue had measured up, “Kubo” might have been a masterpiece.","50","4302938"
"4795","This is a subdued and sometimes subtle exercise in ghostly doings, going against the horror-movie grain by relying on quietude and understatement.","50","230600"
"4796","Anders’ well-attuned comic sensibility makes for moments of hilarity in some of the more originally conceived scenes, but bogs down in predictability with reliance on too many stock situations that absorb the bulk of the running time.","50","2170439"
"4797","Complain all you want about Willis's posturing and the rabbit-in-the-hat ending (predicated as it is on a vast plothole), the film is still a rarity, a studio horror movie focused on a child's traumatic stress.","50","167404"
"4798","It all makes for clumsy-fun escapism, not bad as end-of-summer chillers go.","50","2870612"
"4799","Despite another solid performance from Jennifer Lawrence, anchoring Russell’s sincerely felt tribute to the power of a woman’s resolve in a man’s world, it’s hard not to wish Joy were better — that its various winsome parts added up to more than a flyweight product that still feels stuck in the development stage.","50","2446980"
"4800","There's a human tragedy somewhere here-but aggrandized puppy-love romance and stylish revenge fantasy is all that lingers.","50","1228987"
"4801","A western for people who are completely ignorant about the genre. Costner's direction is barely competent and frequently clumsy.","50","99348"
"4802","Hellbound offers a consistent, low-level queasiness, an effect more of revulsion than horror. It's nothing that a good shot of Pepto-Bismol wouldn't take care of.","50","95294"
"4803","It's a film of noble sacrifice and ""good deaths"" but surprisingly few chuckles.","50","1217613"
"4804","When Queen of the Damned knows it's ridiculous, it's moderately entertaining fun; when it tries to be serious, it's truly ridiculous.","50","238546"
"4805","Shrunk is a sometimes funny, occasionally clever comedy adventure. But the fun stuff consumes only about one-fourth of the film, nowhere near enough for a feature-length movie. [24 June 1989, p.C06]","50","97523"
"4806","The film's a minuet fetishistically repeated until either the audience or the lovers go crazy. I'd say it was a tie.","50","781435"
"4807","The picture is a relentless blast of color and movement that's based on the old TV show, but boils down to a supercharged version of old-time Saturday-afternoon movie serials.","50","120738"
"4808","Gray would have been happiest, I guess, to make movies in the nineteen-seventies, and this one feels much closer to 1975 than to 1988; he could certainly use a seventies audience to watch his movies now--one that could be trusted not to grumble about his slow, unexcitable fades.","50","498399"
"4809","This is high-risk chemistry, and the results are bizarre. The bulging forearms and corncob pipe are in place, but this Popeye hates spinach. The plot hinges on his Oedipal search for his Pappy (Ray Walston), the songs and minimal dances are designed for singers who can't sing and dancers who can't dance, and this gruff icon of pug nacious, all-American goodness has been set adrift on an abstract isle that can perhaps best be described as backlot Ionesco. Popeye's air of alienated whimsy makes for an odd family movie indeed. [22 Dec 1980, p.72]","50","81353"
"4810","Suffice it to say that it's something that would make Austin Powers blush, baby, but it's not supposed to be funny.","50","944835"
"4811","Notwithstanding John Turturro's amusingly smug Italian F1 speedster and a few lighthearted jabs at Japanese TV and technology, Cars 2 generally remains stuck in neutral.","50","1216475"
"4812","I enjoyed this while it lasted, especially for the cast.","50","140397"
"4813","Bloated adaptation of P.D. James's thoughtful, compact novel.","50","206634"
"4814","The movie becomes a crazy quilt of competing stories, none of them properly developed. You could cut half the major characters out of Mr. Brooks and never miss them.","50","780571"
"4815","Begs the question: Did the lads from Squatney trail the zeitgeist at every turn, or were cobandleaders David St. Hubbins and Nigel Tufnel simply in touch with their past and ahead of their time?","50","88258"
"4816","Many of the scenes, already badly written, fail to fulfill their screwball potential. Real Genius should be applauded as a higher class of passage movie. But despite its enthusiastic young cast and its many good intentions, it doesn't quite succeed. I guess there's a leak in the think tank. [9 Aug 1985, p.19]","50","89886"
"4817","As far as acting goes, neither Olsen is ready for Euripides' Medea, yet each projects well enough in their shared big scene.","50","363282"
"4818","Suffers even more than the Harry Potter films from a compulsion to be faithful to the source material, including cramming in a head-spinning assortment of characters and subplots.","50","311289"
"4819","Comes off not as topical but as opportunist. The picture is brushed with a fine glaze of slickness, a product sealed in a blister pack. It's like airplane air -- it has a packaged freshness that isn't really fresh at all.","50","1193138"
"4820","Antonio Banderas looks a little older, Catherine Zeta-Jones snares a bigger role, and the powerful charms of both are weighed down by an absurdly plot-heavy script.","50","386140"
"4821","Comforting, even soothing, to those who like the old songs best. It may confuse those who, because they like the characters, think it is good. It is not good. It is skillful.","50","265662"
"4822","Supergirl arouses some initial curiosity about the differences between the two cousins; for instance, that Supergirl can't change in phone booths and is much the better flier of the two. However the film, as directed by Jeannot Szwarc and written by David Odell, quickly loses its novelty.","50","88206"
"4823","This exercise in hysteria is so over the top that you don't know whether to scream or laugh. Despite an emotionally gripping performance by Natalie Portman, it's nothing more than a lavishly staged ""Repulsion"" in toe shoes.","50","947798"
"4824","A nice idea for a movie, but has a mostly silly script and some of the craziest and most laughable casting imaginable. But the movie's main challenge is a simple one: It is very difficult, next to impossible, to build a movie around an inert, inactive character.","50","1327773"
"4825","The production values are above par, but as in Carpenter's original, seeing ghosts is less scary than imagining them.","50","432291"
"4826","A limp, shapeless mess of a film trades in a genuine respect for westerns’ tropes for purile vulgarity and joy-buzzer showmanship.","50","71230"
"4827","Despite a compelling lead in Andrew Garfield, the tension dissipates rather than mounts as this knotty neo-noir slides into a Lynchian swamp of outre weirdness.","50","5691670"
"4828","What’s best about Funny People, actually, is Sandler, who takes the weird, resentful anger that has always coursed beneath his comedy and puts it right on the surface.","50","1201167"
"4829","A Perfect Getaway is, in its own delightfully silly and manipulative way, one of the most effective paranoid thrillers of the new millennium. That doesn't make it a great movie by a long shot.","50","971209"
"4830","Shows none of the edgy storytelling looniness present in Stiller's finest work. Instead, every element seems calculated to service an easygoing commercial product that plays up the sentimentality of the scenario while rendering it inoffensively bland.","50","359950"
"4831","[Douglas McGrath's] adaptation of the novel is as complete as two hours would allow. What it lacks texturally is what no adaptation could adequately supply: the gleam of the Austen prose. [19 Aug 1996, Pg.38]","50","116191"
"4832","Despite Murphy's campaigning, Gentleman deserves a veto. [04 Dec 1992]","50","104114"
"4833","The story soon lapses into familiar private-eye formulas, though, and the characters aren't interesting enough to hold much attention on their own.","50","112857"
"4834","There are a lot of logical gaps in this movie.","50","163579"
"4835","Given the liberties the film takes, it's surprising that it refuses to penetrate Alan Turing's carnality and allow Benedict Cumberbatch to truly wrestle with the torment of the man's sexuality.","50","2084970"
"4836","You’ll come away from this film remembering some of the better moments, and a few of the quieter interactions between the characters, but they’ll be mostly overpowered by the stench of everything else.","50","1967614"
"4837","Even with a wealth of talent involved, Inferno is missing some serious heat.","50","3062096"
"4838","The biggest flaw can be summed up in a short phrase: lack of excitement. Thrillers are supposed to be crammed with thrills (hence the name), but Anaconda is relatively barren of them.","50","118615"
"4839","The film is uncharacteristically rigid and pious for Hitchcock; it feels more like a work of duty than conviction.","50","49470"
"4840","This isn't the work of a newly moral or humanistic filmmaker, but another ruse by the same unscrupulous showman whose funny games have been beguiling us for years.","50","1602620"
"4841","The movie is visually flat: not pasty and garish in the Waters signature style, but merely serviceable and competent in the worst tradition of Hollywood ""professionalism.""","50","427327"
"4842","This is not really riveting material if you didn't go to high school with these boys, and perhaps not even if you did. Played by Steve Guttenberg, Daniel Stern, Mickey Rourke, Kevin Bacon and Timothy Daly, they seem fundamentally decent, but hopelessly trapped in the limits of the time and place. That grubby atmosphere, looked upon as endearing, is the only thing the film has to offer, and while it's amusing at first, one quickly gets the idea. [5 March 1982, p.11]","50","83833"
"4843","Finally, an Adam Sandler comedy that you can sit through without wanting to throw a mallet through the screen.","50","120888"
"4844","First Blood is a gung-ho action flick fast enough and brutal enough to become Stallone's first non-Rocky hit; on the profound sympathetic levels it seeks to address, however, it is an emission of profound stupidity. [22 Oct 1982]","50","83944"
"4845","With all the obvious work that went into this beautifully detailed, giant-scale movie, and considering the historical importance of the subject matter, was it too much to ask for a trace of intelligence, or maturity, or even insight?","50","213149"
"4846","Though positioned as a glum expose of America's violent schools (a cause for hand-wringing at least as far back as 1955's The Blackboard Jungle), the story is overwhelmed by the throbbing score, music-video aesthetic (New York scenes are shot in cold blues and grays, while the L.A. sequences are a hazy, burnt-out yellow) and the exotic, colorful psychos who rule Garfield's classroom: It's a New York Times editorial by way of CLASS OF 1984.","50","118531"
"4847","While there's no denying that young actress Lindsay Lohan has spunk, she's not terribly effective in the dual role. Her performance is awkward and unsubtle -- she relies on an unconvincing British accent to cue us in to which girl she's playing at any given moment.","50","120783"
"4848","A whiz at crafting conventional Hollywood screenplays, Meyers's direction is overreliant on close-ups and medium shots; there's no life to any of the images. Still, the film coasts along smoothly on the charisma of its stars.","50","337741"
"4849","A somewhat lackluster cop buddy movie that goes wrong in two big ways: (1) it fails to utilize Chan's full range of skills, relegating him to the role of a kickboxing action hero and virtually ignoring his comedic aptitude, and (2) it saddles him with a partner, played by the irritating Chris Tucker.","50","120812"
"4850","Something is terribly amiss when the American actors sound like English is their second language.","50","497465"
"4851","It succeeds in bringing O'Barr's comic-book vision to life, but there's little else going on behind the graphic razzle-dazzle and the moody, ominous soundtrack.","50","109506"
"4852","At least Jessica Alba's legion of fans will have something to smile about. If nothing else, Helfrich has shown her in the best light. If only there was something worth seeing here other than her.","50","452625"
"4853","The brothers' latest also has a certain buoyancy...The fizziness, though, proves fleeting, and Hail, Caesar! too often goes flat.","50","475290"
"4854","The script piles the preposterous on top of the absurd and the film's thin charms dissipate, revealing the creaking movie star contraption underneath.","50","1243957"
"4855","The real problems, however, are that Friedkin's nervy, noisy, undisciplined pseudo-realism sits uneasily with his suspense-motivated shock editing; and that compared to (say) Siegel's Dirty Harry, the film maintains no critical distance from (indeed, rather relishes) its 'loveable' hero's brutal vigilante psychology.","50","67116"
"4856","Hidden Figures is a nice movie. At its head is a trio of good performances from Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Monae. But it is in essence a feature-length version of an inspiring social media image macro, or perhaps a Google Doodle. “Did you know that black women were important at NASA?” It has little else to offer.","50","4846340"
"4857","The technical packaging of his picture is terrific - with its high-techManhattan and its split screens and slow motion, Dressed to Kill is - butthe goods it opens to reveal are shoddily second-hand. [26 July 1980]","50","80661"
"4858","Braveheart comes up short by beating the drums of human treachery and violence so loudly they become assaults.","50","112573"
"4859","Sixty-seven minutes in, I looked up and noticed the movie had 53 minutes left to go, even though every plot element had been resolved. And that's precisely where the movie went to hell. [23 Nov 2014, p.M21]","50","47673"
"4860","Big and dumb and loud and entirely past its prime.","50","359013"
"4861","Sporting a flowing mullet and aviator shades, Dinklage perks things up considerably as the story’s comically arrogant bad-boy-turned-good-guy.","50","2120120"
"4862","It's all about the dumb thrill, baby. Leave it alone, or leave your brain and pocket change at the gate, strap yourself in and just enjoy the ride.","50","479884"
"4863","As I, Tonya skips here and there and thickens the plot, it becomes increasingly baffling why the filmmakers decided to put a comic spin on this pathetic, dispiriting story. No matter how hard the movie tries to coax out laughs, there’s little about Ms. Harding, her circumstances or her choices that skews as funny.","50","5580036"
"4864","Full of nuanced performances (Streep in particular) and wonderfully enveloping music.","50","166943"
"4865","It’s imaginative and even brilliant at times, and then it starts to cave in. But then we think no, maybe not, maybe everything’s going to be made right . . . until it collapses completely. A cynical, smart movie about the dangers of mass culture gives way to a sentimental embrace of the very thing it’s criticizing.","50","5805752"
"4866","The quaint time machine and Oscar-winning special effects hold one's interest initially, but the overall effect is one of glossy emptiness.","50","54387"
"4867","This safe, solemn tale of an aged artist whose vitality is briefly revived by a pretty young thing is unconvincing as an articulation of the potentially spiritual nature of the artist/model relationship.","50","1990217"
"4868","While the visuals are lovely to behold, this unremarkable version of the classic 18th century Japanese legend is stiff and uninvolving.","50","1335975"
"4869","MacGruber dutifully rehearses the genre's standbys -- so dutifully, at times, that the joke disappears altogether.","50","1470023"
"4870","The film goes in for the idea of texture and tics and human behavior, but there's no conviction, and no real push for eccentricity.","50","3659388"
"4871","Empire of the Sun seems to end a half-dozen times -- always a bad sign. Its merits notwithstanding -- and Spielberg probably can't make a bad film -- in its own way this movie is as ego-heavy and ponderous as Ishtar. It's literary, all right. Empire of the Sun is a weighty tome indeed. [11 Dec 1987, p.D1]","50","92965"
"4872","The new film will recruit new friends to the cause; but if we seek George Smiley and his people, with their full complement of terrors, illusions, and shames, we should follow the example of the ever-retiring Smiley, and go back to our books. That's the truth.","50","1340800"
"4873","Tries to make larger points, but it trips over itself just trying to make the small ones.","50","181984"
"4874","The dialogue includes double entendres that are rather clever, if you're mentally at the age of 11.","50","160127"
"4875","Law gives a doozy of a performance: He's fond of bulging his eyes, curling his head like a gargoyle, and displaying a set of rotten yellow teeth. This is some of the most flamboyantly bad acting since Brad Pitt in ""Twelve Monkeys"" (1995). An Oscar nomination would appear inevitable.","50","257044"
"4876","Actually, maybe the movie is better than it seems to be -- I just couldn't understand what anyone was saying. The dialogue came across as clear as schoolyard chatter during recess -- and just about as pleasant to listen to. There is a water slide, a pirate ship and an amusing little chubbikins (Jeff Cohen) who squirts Reddi Wip directly into his mouth. [20 Jun 1985, p.1]","50","89218"
"4877","Storywise, Moon fails to live up to the promise of its premise. There's plenty of atmosphere, but little gravity.","50","1182345"
"4878","As preposterous as the movie gets, it's clearly reveling in its own hokiness.","50","120655"
"4879","A gorgeous screenful of period eye candy.","50","162661"
"4880","Seems curiously unfinished, as if director John Landis spent all his energy on spectacular set pieces and then didn't want to bother with things like transitions, character development, or an ending.","50","82010"
"4881","Romantic comedies can go in all sorts of directions, but they depend on the audience’s believing that a couple should get together and stay together. But in Trainwreck, that belief is hard to come by.","50","3152624"
"4882","The new Bond movie is pure nonsense art of the dadaist school; it follows the rules of the ridiculous as it turns narrative convention, thriller formula and special-effects set pieces into a manifesto of the purest gibberish.","50","143145"
"4883","At heart, though, the story is about the deep, complex, poignant love a man has for his daughter: it's the Lolita syndrome without the lust but with every bit of the doting possessiveness. [30 Dec 1991, p.71]","50","101862"
"4884","This famous film, high on most lists of the greatest films of all time, seems all wrong - phony when it should ring true. Yet, because of the material, it is often moving in spite of the acting, the directing, and the pseudo-Biblical pore-people talk.","50","32551"
"4885","Suburbicon is just too obvious in its satirical depiction of the dubious morality and social inequality behind the squeaky-clean façade of postwar American life, though it's watchable enough, and a distinct improvement for Clooney on his last directorial outing.","50","491175"
"4886","You have the queasy sense that the whole thing is just an elaborate stunt, and in this case an exploitative one.","50","139134"
"4887","For a while, it's like really cool, with lots of energy and stuff, but then it gets like major repetitious, and you wish it was like over, y'know? As if!","50","112697"
"4888","Johnston understands everything about old-fashioned werewolf movies except why they were scary.","50","780653"
"4889","The third Star Trek film is not as good as the second, but it's reasonably entertaining fare for non-fans.","50","88170"
"4890","Falls victim to flimsy characters and a love story that strains reality.","50","340855"
"4891","Director Danny Boyle and screenwriter John Hodge (who is a physician!) keep the action spurting forward, but their approach is oblique. We seem to be catching the odds and ends of scenes; it's as if the filmmakers wanted to make a movie in which all the expected high points were skimped.","50","111149"
"4892","Never takes off, but it never collapses. At times, it becomes frustrating -- for example, about 30 minutes are spent pursuing a lead that goes nowhere.","50","443706"
"4893","Lacking in originality.","50","35423"
"4894","The pace is so plodding, and the general effect so stultifyingly unsubtle, that one is left impressed only by the fine landscape photography and Dean's surprisingly convincing portrayal of a middle-aged man.","50","49261"
"4895","In contrast with the fragmented kineticism of Paul Greengrass' ""Bourne"" movies, there's no existential dimension to the shattered-glass aesthetic here; it's just raw, chaotic action, inelegantly shot and staged but no less unnerving for it.","50","1599348"
"4896","The movie has an air of recent discovery, of shocked innocence about the tawdry quality of city life that is gratingly naive. The film goes most disastrously wrong when it tries to turn slice-of-life realism into full-scale melodrama.","50","75314"
"4897","This is a movie with an admittedly leftist slant. Some of the scenes are gruesome and powerful. But its politics are distracting, making the film less an artistic undertaking and more a political statement. [12 Feb 1982, p.11]","50","84335"
"4898","It's subpar sitcom.","50","889573"
"4899","Hysteria, however skillfully maintained, should never be mistaken for art-a caution that applies equally to Stone and his subject. [01 Mar 1991]","50","101761"
"4900","Truth itself is little more than a word in The Prestige, a film that both celebrates the wonder of being fooled and the foolishness of wanting just that.","50","482571"
"4901","Gandolfini delivers a funny, poignant performance befitting a great actor. It’s heartbreaking that the film doesn’t measure up to his exemplary turn.","50","2390361"
"4902","A dark comedy that blows up like an exploding cigar, leaving nothing much behind but smoke, noise and a bad taste.","50","266452"
"4903","Reportedly, Lucas has been tinkering with this ""director's cut"" for nearly two years, so its sound and visual elements -- which were fairly impressive to begin with -- have been markedly enhanced, while new digital backgrounds give the film a more epic scale. Still, it's an extraordinarily unengaging and tedious affair.","50","66434"
"4904","Scares, to be sure, which is certainly one promise on which it delivers. But the film offers little insight into what it seems to be saying is essentially a mundane fact of life: When one devil leaves the world, there is always another one waiting just outside the door.","50","118636"
"4905","Can he do the thing? Well, yes and no. He -- Mamet, David, celebrated celebrity playwright and less-certain maker of movies -- can do some of the things, like assemble a cast sleek as a cat.","50","252503"
"4906","It's fitfully funny but never really takes off. Out of the corners of our eyes we glimpse the missed opportunities for some real satirical digging.","50","258153"
"4907","Problems arise in the film’s third act, however, with a profoundly implausible plot turn that sends the movie skidding into bogeyman horror. It cheapens the sentiment, and the film doesn’t recover.","50","448134"
"4908","Is it any wonder this Nightmare never coalesces? He couldn’t make up his mind about whether to be naughty or nice.","50","107688"
"4909","Blue Ruin is more artful and evocative than any recent revenge picture, but it’s still drivel.","50","2359024"
"4910","The Alabama setting is as phony as the one in Forrest Gump, and for all of Finney's effectiveness as a yarn-spinning geezer, his whoppers seem disconnected from his character and each other--a weakness Burton fails to resolve with an awkward Felliniesque finale.","50","319061"
"4911","Anderson's other hallmarks here are brilliant gags that deflate in the execution, potentially interesting characters that end up so flat they feel as if they'd been cut out of paper, a plot that's all setup and no story.","50","265666"
"4912","Amusingly macabre. [16 July 1999]","50","139414"
"4913","Between the swash and the buckle, Reynolds comes up completely dry - the connecting scenes lack any rhythm or pace. And Costner looks every bit as uncomfortable as he sounds - the British actors, especially Rickman, blow him off the screen.[24 June 1991]","50","102798"
"4914","Mr. Sargent and Mr. Zinneman have amplified the story with solemn care, in good taste (which is not always desirable), and have come forth with a film that is both well-meaning and on the side of the angels but with the exception of a half-dozen scenes, lifeless.","50","76245"
"4915","All traces of grit from John Carney's earlier films have been scrubbed away in favor of relentlessly crowd-pleasing slickness.","50","3544112"
"4916","Like Top Secret and other less inspired efforts made by Zucker, brother Jerry Zucker and pal Jim Abrahams, The Naked Gun 2 is consistently amusing without being outright funny. [28 June 1991, p.6]","50","102510"
"4917","You never lose interest for a moment, and the images are often striking: Javier Julia did the stylish cinematography. Yet there’s little lift from the carryings-on, not much buoyancy in the misanthropy.","50","3011894"
"4918","The acting is capable and the suspense is effective at times, but the gore is grisly and the climax is surprisingly hokey.","50","112722"
"4919","In his directorial debut, comedian and Flirting with Disaster star Ben Stiller struggles to filter out a coherent story line around a fibre-optic-thin plot line and the expansive, anarchic comic talents of Jim Carrey. Too often the movie ends up lost in the snow and static between two films fighting for the same bandwidth. [14 June 1996, p.C1]","50","115798"
"4920","Instead of being supple and expansive like the book, this Little Children is heavy-handed and snarky.","50","404203"
"4921","Until its dopey coda, the film never all-out stumbles, but always exudes Pakula's trademark chilliness. [17 Dec 1993 Pg. 01.D]","50","107798"
"4922","Only Hailee Steinfeld’s committed performance as Nadine, a troubled high-school junior in Oregon, and Woody Harrelson’s deft turn, as a teacher who helps her, make this thin and cliché-riddled comic drama worth watching.","50","1878870"
"4923","This isn’t Cody’s most witty script, and the Oscar-winning Theron isn’t the most gifted at delivering these warmed-over one-liners.","50","5610554"
"4924","At several points, Strange Brew is so unhinged that it works -- when it looks as if Hosehead the skunk/dog will be late for Oktoberfest, he jumps into the air and flies there -- but as Bob and Doug seem to concede in the film's opening, they are simply not interesting enough to carry a movie. Neither is anyone else involved, and there you are: small beer. [29 Aug 1983, p.C6]","50","86373"
"4925","It's tremendously clever, but ultimately pointless.","50","270288"
"4926","Startlingly shallow even for a summer movie.","50","161081"
"4927","There's no question that Black women are underrepresented in movies. There's also no question that when they get a chance to perform, they deserve a better movie than For Colored Girls.","50","1405500"
"4928","Part bromance, part sci-fi spoof and all a bit disappointing.","50","1092026"
"4929","Now the mush has taken over, and Columbus has slowed his pace in nervous deference to the solemnity of his plot (not to mention the opulence of his characters' lives).","50","120686"
"4930","The monochrome photography and pseudo-documentary interpolations can't disguise the basic Harold Robbins material, and the good performances (Hoffman and Perrine) stand little chance against Fosse's withering direction: the subject matter needs far defter psychological handling than it gets.","50","71746"
"4931","Shallow down inside, End of Watch is a music-video Frappuccino of quick cuts, sparkling banter, serial crises, grisly violence and tongue-jerk profanity. But the film is exciting, in its manipulative way, and exhausting.","50","1855199"
"4932","These guileless airheads with the outrageous vocabulary are obviously a beloved creation, and filmmakers might have gotten more mileage if they'd rooted their adventure a bit more in reality.","50","101452"
"4933","Sentimental and pandering.","50","1441951"
"4934","Snazzy visuals, of which she (Moss) is one, carry The Matrix past its klutzy script.","50","133093"
"4935","The Wrestler doesn't add up. It's constructed with great care around a lead performance that is everything it could possibly be, but the picture itself is off-putting and disappointing.","50","1125849"
"4936","What’s missing here is the amnesiac hook that made ""The Bourne Identity"" such a sleeper hit.","50","372183"
"4937","As impressive as the industrial-style special effects may be, they're both too much and not enough for this mild mild West.","50","120891"
"4938","The first half has a sardonic edge to it, but the more seriously the movie takes itself the sillier it gets.","50","86567"
"4939","An elegant-looking picture, carefully made and beautifully put together, but when the gloss wears off, you're left with an experience that doesn’t quite satisfy. [5 Oct 1990, Daily Datebook, E10]","50","100150"
"4940","Benigni wants to tell a poignant fable rooted in the love between a father and son, but everything hinges on whether one finds his gags inspired or tasteless. Humor can only save some of us.","50","118799"
"4941","With Rachel Weisz and Rachel McAdams starring as its furtive, inflamed lovers, Disobedience has pedigree to spare. But the result feels wonky and lopsided, as if several crucial scenes were left behind on the cutting-room floor.","50","6108178"
"4942","Too bad the story tucked around all that production design is such a futuristic drag.","50","2333804"
"4943","As a portrait of an author on the verge of a breakthrough, this is a run-of-the-mill, occasionally clumsy biopic; as for contextualizing Christmas, it never explains how it functioned before Dickens and only briefly mentions how it changed after him.","50","6225520"
"4944","The principal appeal remains the series' principal weakness as well. These films are all about the blurring of the boundary between dream and reality, which strikes at the heart of what film is all about. But this also means that at regular intervals, someone wakes up to find that it was all a dream, one of the hoariest and least satisfying devices in the history of bad drama. [15 Aug 1989, p.C5]","50","97981"
"4945","There are a few inventive battles on a frozen pond and atop the tiled roof of a temple, but they are so CGI-enhanced as to seem cartoonish, not marvelous.","50","2652118"
"4946","Getting worked up about John Tucker Must Die is a bit like getting worked up about the taste of flan.","50","455967"
"4947","Tongue firmly in cheek and sporting a taste for blood, The Predator has some nasty down-and-dirty pleasures, but director Shane Black can’t entirely reconcile his lightly self-mocking tone with the film’s muscular B-movie action.","50","3829266"
"4948","Tombstone, in spite of its action-movie pacing, becomes an awkward, unconvincing tale as Russell's stubbornly benevolent Earp is slowly nudged by moral compunction into fighting various scourges, not the least of them a vicious gang of red-sashed cowboys led by Curly Bill (Powers Booth) and his fiendishly cool gunslinging sidekick, Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn). [25 Dec 1993, p.E1]","50","108358"
"4949","The movie has homophobic touches, though, and with so many Asian characters, some viewers may wonder why every single one is portrayed as either a hapless victim or a wicked villain.","50","122151"
"4950","Winds up a lot closer to the movies it's taking off from than it cares to admit: cheap, unimaginative and predictable. It's the horror movie equivalent of one of those ""Saturday Night Live"" sketches that drags on interminably, though nobody in it seems to have any idea of just what the joke is.","50","271367"
"4951","It's a lengthy burlesque on paranoia, on conspiracies both real and imagined, so dazed in its color schemes that Anderson clearly wants you to get stoned watching it. But the sense of being blissfully out-of-it, which can have its pleasures, soon drifts into another aspect of drug use: detachment.","50","1791528"
"4952","The film juggles a “follow the money” procedural with corporate espionage thriller, producing two competing tones that never reconcile into one fluid narrative.","50","2140479"
"4953","Mired in phoniness up to its neck. And above that, there's nothing.","50","1142988"
"4954","Beverly Hills Cop is more cop show than comedy riot. Expectations that Eddie Murphy's street brand of rebelliousness would devastate staid and glittery Beverly Hills are not entirely met in a film that grows increasingly dramatic.","50","86960"
"4955","When Landon moves away from the darker parts of the film, opting to play up the campier elements of a mostly silly story, Happy Death Day is the kind of dizzy fun as slasher horror can possibly be. Too bad then that all that goodwill has to reset every night, pushing everything back to square one just as it was getting good, murderously so.","50","5308322"
"4956","Infinitely Polar Bear is a good example of how a film that looks on paper like a mess of indie clichés can be redeemed by fantastic performances … even if, ultimately, it remains a mess of indie clichés.","50","1969062"
"4957","Alan Pakula's pedestrian 1976 recap of Watergate is a study in missed opportunities.","50","74119"
"4958","For all the movie's richness and dazzle, for all that money dripping off the screen, Batman Returns is a gorgeous failure -- flashy, intermittently appealing but, in the end, a big mess. Batman Returns lacks a coherent story. It lacks a point of view and a focus. And so everything suffers, even the art direction. [19 June 1992, p.D1]","50","103776"
"4959","The humour is based entirely on inversion which worked in your cartoons, and even on the TV show, but it's not enough to hold up a movie, even with the helping hand provided by a disembodied hand. [22 Nov 1991]","50","101272"
"4960","The two actors are bound to be showered with awards, as is the production design, the polished script, etc. But there’s no intrigue, no real substance beneath all the gloss.","50","8404614"
"4961","A messy if initially intriguing take on sci-fi-underpinned high school angst for the vlogging age, Chronicle eventually grows repetitive and stale.","50","1706593"
"4962","The characters are all over the map, there are too many unclear story threads, our sympathies are confused, and there's an unconvincing showdown in which the story's lovingly developed ambiguities are lost.","50","118887"
"4963","Though colorfully embellished with authentic detail and logistically complex to bring to the screen, Ayer’s script is bland at the most basic story level, undermined by cardboard characterizations and a stirring yet transparently silly climactic showdown.","50","2713180"
"4964","The writing, by Adam Mansbach, and direction, by Vikram Gandhi, are competent without being terribly sophisticated or daring. Terrell’s performance elevates the film, though.","50","5477566"
"4965","It is no good at all, but fun, at moments, to watch.","50","63442"
"4966","The heavily sprayed-on sociological angle is that hospitals today treat patients like baggage.","50","67217"
"4967","She (Blanchett) seems the only guardian of sanity in this good-old-boy Bellevue.","50","219699"
"4968","The director's murky, ill-conceived take on the world's oldest disaster story contains some of the most pristine visuals produced on a mass studio scale in some time. But it's also constantly tethered to a dull, melodramatic series of events out of whack with any traditional interpretation of the material.","50","1959490"
"4969","Red is neither a good movie nor a bad one. It features actors we like doing things we wish were more interesting.","50","1245526"
"4970","Russell's stylish and imaginative filmmaking wages its own war against lunkheaded and sometimes offensive material.","50","120188"
"4971","The result is a glossy, engaging suspense film that jettisons much of its predecessor's sadism and subtext in favor of crowd-pleasing revenge violence.","50","844708"
"4972","Frozen can count in its favor visual grandeur, two energetic young women as co-leads, and a couple of plot twists that place the film a cut above your average princess fare.","50","2294629"
"4973","Cage is amusingly skanky, Molina is dependably arch, and Baruchel is engagingly down to earth. But do we really need to watch them play out this exhaustingly empty scenario?","50","963966"
"4974","While not exactly original, the premise is certainly effective enough. But Brightburn lacks the visual stylization or wit to elevate it from the realm of the crudely effective B-movie.","50","7752126"
"4975","The family squabbles jangle the nerves while not hitting on insights or memorable emotion.","50","6662736"
"4976","In its own B-film, let's-make-them-jump-out-of-their-seats way, Bats is quite the hoot.","50","200469"
"4977","Despite Amy Adams’ affecting performance as an artist and ’50s/’60s housewife complicit in her own captivity, this relatively straightforward dramatic outing for Tim Burton is too broadly conceived to penetrate the mystery at the heart of the Keanes’ unhappy marriage — the depiction of which is dominated by an outlandish, ogre-like turn from Christoph Waltz that increasingly seems to hold the movie hostage.","50","1126590"
"4978","As the enduring success of this property has shown, there are large, emotionally susceptible segments of the population ready to swallow this sort of thing, but that doesn't mean it's good.","50","1707386"
"4979","You could get high on this movie's technique, dizzy on its storytelling. Yet it's one of the most lucid bad trips ever made.","50","181865"
"4980","There were times watching this movie when I felt I was being force-fed 30 pounds of crème brûlée. Which isn’t to say I choked on every minute: I chortled heartily at the thread about the comeback of the washed-up rock star (Bill Nighy).","50","314331"
"4981","The film is soon bogged down by fake hugs and a faker climax.","50","319343"
"4982","Perhaps due to its rote, by-the-numbers story, all of the original film’s less tangible, hard-to-bottle qualities are absent: its delightfulness, its playfulness, and its natural charisma.","50","2848292"
"4983","Apologies in advance, but for lack of a better descriptor the whole thing is a mess. It’s not even good enough to be a cult movie which is backhanded compliment anyway. But, hey, at least the actors tried.","50","7043012"
"4984","A genre mash that's mildly amusing until it can't think of anything else to do besides flop around in the deep end of conspicuous gore.","50","3316948"
"4985","As the checkout girl everyone's got a crush on, Natalie Portman makes a winsome return to her ""Garden State"" gawkiness.","50","1403177"
"4986","The film strains to achieve a breathless panache and a lurid swagger for which David Leitch’s direction is too heavy-footed and literal.","50","2406566"
"4987","A respectably packaged drama of a young card sharp, played by Steve McQueen, with a capable enough cast, that pungently projects the machinations and back-room temperatures of the side-street professional gambling world and little else.","50","59037"
"4988","There is one high note. You can approach Speed Racer as the trippiest stonerfest since Stanley Kubrick took his space odyssey.","50","811080"
"4989","The Adventures of Ford Fairlane is a nonstop gross-out contest of absolutely no socially redeeming value at all, unless you happen to value laughter. Ford Fairlane is funny garbage. [11 Jul 1990, p.41]","50","98987"
"4990","I wouldn't say this is laugh-out-loud risible, but there are definitely moments. Still, you might want to consider sitting through the uneven thing just to get to the ending, because that's quite something. You may love it, you may hate it, but forget it you won't.","50","884328"
"4991","Produced handsomely in New York, but directed tediously by Alan J. Pakula, the film is a suspenser without much suspense. Donald Sutherland shares above-title billing in a line-throwing, third-banana trifle of a part.","50","67309"
"4992","Strictly for the midnight-movie crowd, Drive Angry serves up a non-stop stream of female nudity, flying body parts, gun battles and smart-alecky dialogue.","50","1502404"
"4993","While the premise is intriguing, the movie is gluey, bumbling and singularly un-thrilling.","50","114369"
"4994","The overall enterprise, for all its intrigue and visceral impact, feels overly thought out, affected and forced in its stylization.","50","993842"
"4995","It's so perfectly contrived and mechanical and fresh as a daisy, it's infuriating.","50","59742"
"4996","The unexciting look and feel of the movie wouldn’t have bothered me if the filmmakers had penetrated Hanssen’s skull a little.","50","401997"
"4997","The whole thing becomes a routine and mechanical cat-and-rat chase, with the outcome completely apparent, despite a few bright and clever twists.","50","38991"
"4998","For all its glitz and gadgets, is markedly inferior in everything but teen appeal.","50","486822"
"4999","As the obscenities of wealth accumulate while a large cast of Asian and Eurasian actors render their many silly characters, the source of the laughter becomes troubling.","50","3104988"
"5000","Crawl is action-packed, with impressive special effects and some jaw-dropping images of mayhem and destruction. But a movie like this demands more storytelling discipline and logistical control than these filmmakers can manage.","50","8364368"
"5001","The trouble with Body Double is not that it sets ""new lows"" in the treatment of women or anything else, but that a stunningly original talent has willingly hitched itself to a derivative vision. The person De Palma really degradesis himself. [26 Oct 1984]","50","86984"
"5002","Beeman and Tolkin drain every trace of real life friction from the story line, pumping it up instead with the standard Hughes synthetics: kids who are preternaturally smart, sophisticated and poised (Haim's best friend, played by Corey Feldman, has a swagger that suggests Robert Mitchum at his cockiest); adults who are monstrous, cretinous and ultimately pathetic. [07 July 1988, p.3C]","50","95519"
"5003","May not be grade-A prime, but it ain't chopped liver either.","50","805570"
"5004","At first appears to be rich with a quantity of felt life, but on reflection seems both more carefully studied and more coldly casual than profoundly understood.","50","65724"
"5005","As Kurt finds his true art in the West, thanks to the help of a fictional version of Joseph Beuys, the film turns gripping, but it ultimately reduces art appreciation to the autobiographical.","50","5311542"
"5006","Not only is this comedy no Bull Durham, it's just plain bull. [7 Apr 1989, p.6D]","50","97815"
"5007","The story is too slender for its two-hour running time, and the pace is lugubrious, as though everyone in front and behind the camera were depressed. But the biggest obstacle is the protagonist (Joaquin Phoenix), who is almost without definition.","50","1798709"
"5008","Haley and co-writer Marc Basch have their hearts in the right place.... But while they’re steering clear of so many pitfalls, they don’t give the impression that they’re steering in any specific direction. The film is a parade of barely connected events, presided over by a barely connected protagonist.","50","3236120"
"5009","Randolph and Parker play fair with us, setting up a motive early and clearly. Yet whether you buy the motive or find it far-fetched, it almost immediately tells you who's responsible for the death.","50","289992"
"5010","Beneath the polished surface, Dead Poets Society is moribund at the core - too pat, too safe and too hypocritical, as conformist as the conformity it so easily decries.","50","97165"
"5011","Technically impressive horror film and sometimes fun to watch, but totally undistinguished.","50","120804"
"5012","It is good-natured, lowbrow, backlot, hit-or-miss humor, but with no cumulative effect beyond its succession of hard-worked jokes. More theatrical than cinematic in its conception, this group effort relies on the improvisation of its performers.","50","72431"
"5013","Writer-director Paul Weitz's proudly boisterous star vehicle for Lily Tomlin has about as many ambitions as it does delusions.","50","4270516"
"5014","Ad Astra (Latin for “To the Stars”) has dazzling eye candy and reasonable extrapolations of what near future space colonization might look like...But like too many imitation “Space Odysseys,” it flunks that most basic test applied to science fiction of this nature. It doesn’t make us care what happens, and I, for one, don’t care to see it again.","50","2935510"
"5015","The Brady Bunch Movie is fairly innocuous, and ought to satisfy the twenty- and thirtysomethings who grew up on the sitcom. Just one problem: It may be unsporting to point this out, but the whole notion of holding up the Bradys as the ultimate cultural icon of the '70s is basically a lie.","50","112572"
"5016","Low on Diesel fuel, though probably amusing enough if you're part of the intended demographic, which appears to be the age group that likes to stick fingers up noses.","50","395699"
"5017","Mines the increasingly fertile territory of aging boomer parents and chafing middle-aged siblings, but at irritatingly high volume, with the cantankerous voices of Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller and Dustin Hoffman nearly constantly talking over one another.","50","5536736"
"5018","If Welles was unhappy at the prospect of the human race splitting in two, he probably wouldn't be too crazy with his great-grandson's movie splitting up in pretty much the same way.","50","268695"
"5019","Transforms Charles Dickens into a Chuck. Ground Chuck, unfortunately. [30 January 1998, p. 7D]","50","119223"
"5020","The truth is About Schmidt offers only the sporadic laugh, the less frequent original cultural insight and, at best, a craftsmanlike performance from its aging headliner. The truth is there are long stretches in the picture that are unequivocally dull.","50","257360"
"5021","Cholodenko casts much better than she writes. Yet, alas, even a talented veteran like Moore can't sell a hoary line like, ""Sometimes you hurt the ones you love the most."" Maybe if she'd set it to music – nope, sorry, that's already been done.","50","842926"
"5022","In the end, the film shakes down as a kind of eat-your-spinach exercise, a movie that’s worthy and perhaps good for you, but is labored and only enjoyable intermittently.","50","3170832"
"5023","On the Basis of Sex plays like a sunny fantasy from a more optimistic age.","50","4669788"
"5024","Standard-issue liberal feel-good fodder.","50","195685"
"5025","We’ve heard the same lesson countless times before in other movies, and though it’s certainly impressive to see Conor’s anxieties manifest themselves in such a stunning Ent-like being, as monsters go, Bayona’s creation is all bark and no bite.","50","3416532"
"5026","Nothing more than an over-designed lobster pot. After following the beckoning twists and turns, you're left trapped and more than a little disappointed for getting in so deep.","50","114814"
"5027","The film itself never felt quite so densely plotted as Yimou apparently had hoped.","50","115012"
"5028","Then Bill Nighy shows up and is awesome and punches you in the heart. It ultimately feels like a cheat, and while there won’t be a dry eye in the house, it won’t be earned.","50","2194499"
"5029","What should be a clammy exercise in claustrophobic, queasy tension becomes, in the hands of writer/director James DeMonaco, an underpowered compendium of over-familiar scare tactics and sledgehammer-subtle social satire.","50","2184339"
"5030","Paradoxically, it is Shawshank's zealousness in trying to cast a rosy glow over the prison experience that makes us feel we're doing harder time than the folks inside. [23 Sept 1994]","50","111161"
"5031","No one can dismiss 16 Blocks as a mere formula flick -- it's a mere two or three formula flicks all fighting for top billing.","50","450232"
"5032","It would be wrong to say Close’s performance in The Wife is wasted, but it certainly deserves a better movie.","50","3750872"
"5033","It's the first film to include both a cameo appearance by Jesus and a full-frontal nude shot of Harvey Keitel dancing in a drugged stupor. [20 Nov 1992, Life, p.4D]","50","103759"
"5034","The movie's problem is that no one seemed to have any fun making it, and it's hard to have much fun watching it. It's a depressing experience.","50","96895"
"5035","This slick, handsomely produced thriller only gets the pulse half racing.","50","228750"
"5036","Ultimately, though, Jack Goes Boating is too much of a banal thing. Jack's a good guy, and you root for him all the way to the end, but, wistfully, that doesn't make him an any more interesting everyday Joe than he is.","50","1278379"
"5037","In the end only Channing, reprising her award-winning stage role, manages to inject some authentic feeling into this somewhat mechanical enterprise.","50","108149"
"5038","Watson makes a smooth matriculation from the England-made Harry Potter epics to this movie's thrifty, six-week Pittsburgh shoot.","50","1659337"
"5039","Buried under an avalanche of action. (1996 June 7, pg. D1)","50","117500"
"5040","You can read a lot into it, but it isn't very enjoyable. The lines are often awkward and the line readings worse, and the film is often static, despite economic, quick editing.","50","49730"
"5041","The film progresses to the point where it feels less like father and son, and more like a young boy listening to an inspirational audiobook.","50","1815862"
"5042","The Great Outdoors isn't great. The Dopey Outdoors would be more like it. It's wildly uneven, yet consistently dumb. [17 June 1988, p.C5]","50","95253"
"5043","Everybody in and around this movie is trying too hard...After half an hour, we realized that, instead of enjoying a funny film, we were being lightly bullied into finding fun where precious little exists. [5 April 2004, p. 89]","50","335245"
"5044","Add a lot of dull acting -- except Sir Ian McKellen and Andy Serkis -- and you have an uneven movie with yawns aplenty.","50","167260"
"5045","Unfortunately, this visually sumptuous epic is the very definition of a ""prestige production,"" swaddled in good taste and better intentions.","50","120102"
"5046","The film was shot in Louisiana, which looks nothing like Iowa. Nobody along the way seems to have a care in the world about cholesterol. And it's the first movie in history that makes Hugh Jackman look repulsive.","50","1349451"
"5047","A well-intentioned but self-defeatingly manipulative film that amounts to an impassioned commercial for national health care.","50","251160"
"5048","A garish mediocrity.","50","120667"
"5049","The movie dawdles along, boring us as it does, in between action sequences. There’s a good chase or two, a generic escape here and there, but almost no cool lines and no catch-phrases.","50","4779682"
"5050","Mo'Nique, co-star of TV's ""The Parkers,"" gives a loud, brassy performance as Peaches Whitaker.","50","382561"
"5051","Crowe understands what's interesting about Nash: He's not a feel-good figure. It's a pity the same can't be said for Howard.","50","268978"
"5052","It's meant to be faintly Pythonesque with a hint of bowdlerized ""The Black Adder""...But it's entirely too slow of foot for that comparison to pay off.","50","1240982"
"5053","Lucy In The Sky ends up playing like some unauthorized Jackie Jormp-Jomp version of the Lisa Nowak story, as though they couldn’t get the rights to the names, or to the shit.","50","4682804"
"5054","Less the blistering satire it imagines itself than a blustering, bloody, blundering melodrama about bottom feeders nibbling each other.","50","179626"
"5055","Unfoldment of the screenplay, based on novel by Walter S. Tevis, is far overlength, and despite the excellence of Newman’s portrayal of the boozing pool hustler the sordid aspects of overall picture are strictly downbeat.","50","54997"
"5056","As beautiful and compelling as Ramsay’s filmmaking and Phoenix’s central performance are, the degree to which viewers will buy You Were Never Really Here depends on the degree to which they accept yet another display of febrile vigilante brutality motivated by sexual violence perpetrated against young girls. One person’s trope, after all, is another’s shopworn cliche.","50","5742374"
"5057","The production has a very handsome mid-1930s New Orleans period flavour but the cast can’t lick the script.","50","73092"
"5058","There are a few hilarious moments, and a few more that are foolish and even disgusting. [15 July 1988, Art and Leisure, p.21]","50","95159"
"5059","Hill’s basically remaking Larry Clark’s seminal 1995 film “Kids,” a picture inherently more authentic because it was a snapshot taken in that moment. And if you prefer the rose-colored lens of nostalgia, that’s been done too, in Jonathan Levine’s 2008 effort “The Wackness.”","50","5613484"
"5060","Too full of its own heavy breathing to work as the primordial storytelling it's aiming for--a so-so adventure story is closer to the mark.","50","162222"
"5061","The screenplay, however, denies the film a solid foundation. Jumanji is diverting in a splashy , eye-catching manner, but is about as substantive and durable as filigree.","50","113497"
"5062","The movie is pulled along mostly by James Marsden's cheerfully over-the-top performance as Ian's homophobic older brother, but Josh Zuckerman does a nice job of keeping Ian likable.","50","1135985"
"5063","The movie is all visuals and atmosphere without an effective structure. It doesn't move you, it's on display. [24 Feb 1990, p.E5]","50","100260"
"5064","There's nothing new about this sado-cinema, and nothing much worthy, either.","50","147612"
"5065","While the movie may not, in the end, be so effective in tapping into our current class anxieties, that hardly seems to matter. Like a trip to Elysium, it’s a wild ride.","50","1535108"
"5066","With director Harmony Korine's visual overload and somnolent voice-overs — the same sentences are repeated ad nauseum — it manages to be both mind-numbingly dull and off-putting.","50","2101441"
"5067","Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie is not the heart-warming, life-affirming, feel-good hit of the summer. Let Pocahantas and Casper provide the hugs and lessons. The Power Rangers, as usual, are on hand to kick intergalactic butt. [30 June 1995]","50","113820"
"5068","The sad part is that How Do You Know is nowhere near as dumb as it looks. A couple of comic set pieces are inspired-or would be, if Brooks's timing weren't off.","50","1341188"
"5069","It's mostly forced humor all the way, a movie that rarely measures up to adequate kitsch. Aimed at younger audiences, Spaceballs misses its mark.","50","94012"
"5070","What the movie lacks -- a big lack, not a fatal lack -- is a compelling character at its center. Everyone in Garden State is fun, skewed, strange and singular.","50","333766"
"5071","I think mature pre-teens along with immature teens might relate to this overbearing showcase of bizarre rubber duckies. Adults are bound to find it a major yawn, and young children are likely to be scared out of their wits. [27 Jun 1986, p.82]","50","91369"
"5072","At best, Rambo: First Blood Part II is a crudely effective right-wing rabble-rouser, the artistic equivalent of carpet bombing -- you don't know whether to cheer or run for cover. At worst, it's a tribute to Sylvester Stallone, by Sylvester Stallone, starring Sylvester Stallone. [22 May 1985, p.F1]","50","89880"
"5073","The film almost redeems itself with what may be the longest, most elaborate post-film/pre-credits sequence in film history, but it will still disappoint anyone expecting more than watchable trash.","50","120890"
"5074","Warrior's three principle characterizations are compelling - Nolte in particular gives a tempered performance as the shambling, sad-eyed wreck of a dad - but not enough to mask the film's lesser elements.","50","1291584"
"5075","“GBH” is a featherweight screwball comedy that, trying mightily to be cosmopolitan, feels awfully provincial, desperately touristy.","50","2278388"
"5076","[The Coen Brothers] sweat and strain to deliver more of the same cinematic ingenuity, but the result seems more nervous than inspired. Relax, fellas! [13 Mar 1987]","50","93822"
"5077","The movie is exuberant, strapping and obvious -- a problem drama suffering from a steroid overdose.","50","272020"
"5078","Both Smith and his son are appealing presences, but The Pursuit of Happyness seems to take place in a sociological vacuum. Gardner's insight into his difficulties begins and ends with the thought that, in the pursuit of happiness, there's a lot more pursuit involved than happiness, and unasked political questions seem to dangle ominously over the entire movie.","50","454921"
"5079","Jim Carrey proves that he's the most inspired clown in movies today, but parents should be warned that much of the picture's humor is extremely rude and crude.","50","119528"
"5080","Interesting. Not worth the trouble, but interesting. [22 Apr 1988, p.C5]","50","94602"
"5081","The film is blatantly, unmistakably about mental illness, and that makes it hard to ignore or forgive what it ends up saying (hopefully by accident) on the subject.","50","4786282"
"5082","The whole experience of watching casts of talented and over-eager actors try to make sense of his (Allen) nonsensical scripts becomes increasingly strained and bizarre. I’ve felt that way about recent Allen movies I mostly enjoyed, like “Midnight in Paris” and “Vicky Cristina Barcelona,” and it goes double or triple for Blue Jasmine.","50","2334873"
"5083","If my moviegoing experience was magical in any way, it was only in that I once or twice nodded off for a spell.","50","304141"
"5084","Gross-out funny, over-the-top offensive, and just as amusing -- or idiotic -- as you find that Comedy Central sitcom.","50","158983"
"5085","A carefully organized and sanitized war picture from Sam Mendes that turns one of the most catastrophic episodes in modern times into an exercise in preening showmanship.","50","8579674"
"5086","Smith has changed a few plot points around to keep readers who already know the secret of the ruins guessing, and to some extent the strategy works. There was, however, no reason whatsoever to change the book's perfect endings.","50","963794"
"5087","A rambling depiction of a junkie's descent into zombitude.","50","405296"
"5088","Part road-film, part-gambling excursion, and part-bromance, the film does show the influence of its talented directors. But falters when it comes down the story itself.","50","2349144"
"5089","Celeste & Jesse Forever earns points for bucking formula, but its fusion of snark and sincerity has a calculated slickness that rings increasingly hollow.","50","1405365"
"5090","Valentine isn't scary, but it is unsettling; not ultimately satisfying, but arresting in the moment.","50","242998"
"5091","An ambitious, if uneven, experimental sci-fi romance that is less a thought-provoker than a dazzling juggling act.","50","485947"
"5092","Directed by Ang Lee, whose exposure of middle-class hypocrisy would be more effective if it weren't rigged to provide evidence for the story's take on contemporary values.","50","119349"
"5093","The film is a lavish, linear, way-too-long (3 hr. 21 min.) storybook of Malcolm's career, the movie equivalent of an authorized biography, a cautious primer for black pride.","50","104797"
"5094","After a promising opening, with Jason on a rampage and a cold, peculiar bounty hunter (Steven Williams) on Jason's trail, Jason Goes to Hell switches focus midway to the young couple, and from there things go downhill. Still, the film has its moments. [14 Aug 1993, p.F1]","50","107254"
"5095","While McConaughey does his part, there’s just not enough treasure here in Gold to dig.","50","1800302"
"5096","The screenplay, by Daniel Petrie Jr. and Jack Baran, has a number of funny lines and situations, but the end result looks fiddled with by people attempting to ''fix'' things.","50","92654"
"5097","Considering the controversy and chaos Sony Pictures Studios is undergoing because of it, The Interview fails to live up to the hype, floundering as a rowdy comedy as it grows duller by the minute.","50","2788710"
"5098","It's reasonably well told and well mounted but little more.","50","116209"
"5099","Michôd wants a Greek epic but doesn't have the material. Animal Kingdom is a work of obvious ambition, and seeing a debut filmmaker swing for the fences like this is its own kind of moviehead satisfaction.","50","1313092"
"5100","A lazy, self-satisfied piece of work -- a comedy made by people who think so highly of themselves, they assume they'll get a laugh just by showing up in front of the camera.","50","357413"
"5101","Scary Movie 2 had seven writers. Seven. That's one writer for every big laugh in its stealthy 82 minutes. More frightening: these jokes are worth waiting for.","50","257106"
"5102","The Year of Living Dangerously is chic, enigmatic, self-assured - and empty. [18 Feb 1983]","50","86617"
"5103","Corbet doesn’t seem as interested in the answers to the provocatively glib questions he raises as he is in creating a cynical riddle cloaked in style. No doubt some will find all of this to be a deep meditation on the pop-industrial complex, but from where I was sitting, it just felt like empty camp.","50","5960374"
"5104","Not worth the rocket fuel.","50","272152"
"5105","The longest, grimmest and least funny of the trilogy.","50","449088"
"5106","The film evades all but the most careful commonplaces about the relationship between the viewer and the work of art at its center.","50","2404425"
"5107","What's unfortunate is that Toothless is starring in a toothless story.","50","1646971"
"5108","A twisted tale of toxic female friendship, the film offers its share of pleasures: eye candy in human, sartorial and real-estate form, as well as the unmistakable flair of a director and performers who know their way around a piece of pop entertainment. But the result leaves you scratching your head.","50","7040874"
"5109","Sydney Pollack doesn't have a knack for action pulp; he gets some tension going in this expensive spy thriller, but there's no real fun in it.","50","73802"
"5110","It's not a cheap rip-off -- it's a credible sequel to a horror classic, and a sad reminder that some things never change.","50","144814"
"5111","The best performance comes from Stanley Tucci as the Runway art director. Tucci presents a homosexual man without a trace of cartoon--shrewd, skilled, and weathered without being worn. It is a well-judged and accomplished piece of work.","50","458352"
"5112","Battle of the Sexes sacrifices some of its innate appeal by making ham out of the supposed relics of a less enlightened era.","50","4622512"
"5113","Despite its failings, Wind Chill represents a road rarely taken by 21st-century American horror films: Original (in the non-remake sense of the term), subtle and restrained.","50","486051"
"5114","All of these beasties are ""scary."" Though they'd be much more so if they felt less like franchisable IP and more like fervent expressions of the ills of the eras on which the film aims to comment.","50","3387520"
"5115","There are plenty of truths to be found in Last Flag Flying, and a great deal of sincerity as well. But regrettably, there is not much in the way of understatement.","50","6018306"
"5116","Let us now praise Seth ''Scott Evil'' Green, whose beautiful delivery of otherwise generic wisecracks is all that stands between this painfully derivative horror comedy and a premature date with the eject button.","50","138510"
"5117","Although idiotic, The Evil Dead at least is propelled by energy and enthusiasm. It's scarier than many a more pretentious effort, and not everything in it is borrowed. [8 Oct 1983, p.Arts1]","50","83907"
"5118","Team America is at once grandiose and tacky, elaborate and deflationary.","50","372588"
"5119","Juicy, revved-up, semi-satisfying biopic.","50","472198"
"5120","A Perfect World is perfect indeed - for the initial 15 minutes. After that, the fault-lines start to emerge, widening, widening, until the thing cracks open and falls apart. [24 Nov 1993]","50","107808"
"5121","It's an event film, all about flash and spectacle, even though the movie itself is void of any real substance.","50","245674"
"5122","The premise is marvelous, the music more than adequate (assuming you're a metal fan), the performances appropriately dumb. And it's seasonally funny. [28 Oct 1986, p.D5]","50","92112"
"5123","A free-wheeling, uninhibited all-star romp, Ocean's Eleven set the pace for the ""caper"" films of the 1960s and 1970s.","50","54135"
"5124","Ponderously cliched and predictable. [19 July 1996, p.N33]","50","116365"
"5125","Nothing wrong about a movie that says, Stop and smell the roses. Now, if only director Rob Reiner hadn't rubbed our noses in a bouquet of plastic blooms.","50","825232"
"5126","There are good movies to be made about romantic obsession, but the premise doesn't work if the crazy stalker isn't juxtaposed with a sympathetic victim.","50","881891"
"5127","A movie filled with gags and excellent stunts which remains curiously humourless at heart. Stunted, not stunning.","50","81568"
"5128","Bottom line: This Orphan is an atmospheric and occasionally vicious little git and an above-average entry into the ""cuddly hellspawn"" genre, overlong at two-plus hours, but nowhere near as excruciatingly overdone as others of its ilk (Devil Times Five, I'm talking to you).","50","1148204"
"5129","Despite the grating, workmanlike direction of Chris Columbus (he's no Robert Wise, and Rent is nobody's idea of ""West Side Story""), this boisterous adaptation is both a vivacious, wiseacre musical and an inarguable morality lesson: Love is all you need. Oh, and rent, of course.","50","294870"
"5130","Certainly, whatever surgery the script doctors performed, it didn't take. The limp result is a picture that is epic in intention and Lilliputian everywhere else.","50","118972"
"5131","It's lacking in eventfulness and drama, but there's a sweetness in it that places it a cut above most synthetic children's films. As a writer and director, Evans doesn't always know where to go with his material, but at least there's some feeling behind it, and this sometimes rescues it from its becalmed predictability. [7 Apr 1993, p.49]","50","108037"
"5132","Bouncing about from one flawed movie to another, Steven Spielberg has lost his way of late, and Munich finds him more disoriented than ever.","50","408306"
"5133","Directed by Tony Scott (Top Gun) with his usual testosterone-injected verve, Scout is never boring but hardly edifying. With a nod to the '90s, the formula does digress to allow the pals to expose their emotional wounds to each other. [13 Dec 1991, p.4D]","50","102266"
"5134","At least the werewolves in Red Riding Hood have teeth and, when in human form, they don't parade around shirtless.","50","1486185"
"5135","Very Bad Things only getes worse. [25 November 1998, p. 44]","50","124198"
"5136","The results are predictably lachrymose, especially with the reinstated ""unhappy"" ending from the original French version.","50","95250"
"5137","There's a lot of wasted effort here trying to distract us from what we know good and well is going to happen. Nevertheless, it's time pleasantly spent.","50","104952"
"5138","After a while, Nine plays like some Hollywood charity revue.","50","875034"
"5139","Shelton's movie never quite transcends its cheap, baseball-card poignancy. You never get the feeling these pulp-fiction archetypes -- the young hack-writer and the aging bull -- are real people. [06 Jan 1995, p.N37]","50","109450"
"5140","Doesn't pack the punch of Schrader and Scorsese's career-best collaborations (""Raging Bull,"" ""Taxi Driver"").","50","163988"
"5141","Director Ridley Scott's Black Rain belongs to the blunt instrument school of filmmaking. This cop thriller, set largely in Osaka, Japan, is so full of screeching tires, flashing neon and extravagant violence that it's almost physically painful to watch, yet that seems to be the effect the director had in mind. If you smack the audience around enough, you'll be respected for your power.","50","96933"
"5142","Hughes is just treading lukewarm water. Stotz is the blandest of his teen heroes yet. [16 Mar 1987]","50","94006"
"5143","Director Jim Field Smith lifts his best beats from Judd Apatow, and his worst from ""American Pie.""","50","815236"
"5144","Lacking any equivalent to the Sadean excess of Ellis's prose, it is also further evacuated of purpose.","50","144084"
"5145","At least Dennis Hopper plays the bad guy with wildness and wit. Costner's stolid hero seems a washout by comparison.","50","114898"
"5146","Like ""An Officer and a Gentleman"", Top Gun travels a cramped emotional range. The characters don't really change, but have plot devices imposed on them. Unlike its template, however, Top Gun does have a payoff: Maverick and his pals do a lot of flying, and many of the aerial scenes are impressive. [16 May 1986, p.6]","50","92099"
"5147","Pet Sematary finesses some of the bumpy narrative moments from the original, but where it forges its own path is in rewriting Ellie's story. This is initially intriguing, but it ultimately reveals itself to be the less original choice, relying on horror archetypes and tropes we've seen before.","50","837563"
"5148","Meyer's screenplay has been called unsuccessful, and I agree; but, without glossing some bumps that are his doing, I'd say that in this case the trouble with the screen adaptation is the novel.","50","308383"
"5149","Hero claims to be a gentle, playful parody of the action/adventure genre, but comes off as a mercenary attempt to cash in on summer movie-going habits.","50","107362"
"5150","Ultimately, frustration and fatigue prevail over the film’s intellectual acuity and political insight; neither is any true emotion ever forthcoming. This is odd and disappointing.","50","385887"
"5151","If one of its points is to show that underused thirtyish actresses still are attractive, it succeeds with Leigh and Cates -- and Jennifer Beals, who also provides a flashback feeling playing Cummings' ex-squeeze.","50","254099"
"5152","Effects work is slick, and Goddard keeps his foot on the accelerator with help from David Julyan's suspense-building score. It's just too bad the movie is never much more than a hollow exercise in self-reflexive cleverness that's not nearly as ingenious as it seems to think.","50","1259521"
"5153","Though The Conjuring claims to be based on a true story, in truth it's based on every horror film that's come before it.","50","1457767"
"5154","When Ross gets serious and grasps for allegorical import, Pleasantville bogs down in mixed ambitions.","50","120789"
"5155","As slasher movies go, Halloween II is far from the bottom of the barrel, but, given its pedigree, one has a right to expect a higher degree of quality that what is delivered.","50","82495"
"5156","The Oxford theory is ridiculous, yet the filmmakers go all the way with it, producing endless scenes of indecipherable court intrigue in dark, smoky rooms, and a fashion show of ruffs, farthingales, and halberds. The more far-fetched the idea, it seems, the more strenuous the effort to pass it off as authentic.","50","1521197"
"5157","It succeeds only fitfully. Toggling between Stark's impish goatee and Iron Man's full-metal body condom, and amid so many generic fireballs, kill shots and earsplitting thumps, bumps and crunches, the film finally collapses under its own weight.","50","371746"
"5158","So, there you have it, a bad good movie, or a good bad movie, but a very decent Jennifer Lopez movie.","50","2126357"
"5159","It's whenever the music stops that the movie runs into trouble.","50","458522"
"5160","Elaborately conceived from a visual standpoint, Ridley Scott's first sci-fier in the three decades since ""Blade Runner"" remains earthbound in narrative terms, forever hinting at the existence of a higher intelligence without evincing much of its own.","50","1446714"
"5161","Because Spielberg seems as eager as Wade to get back to the digital fantasy world he’s created, a lot of the human element is elided or glossed over.","50","1677720"
"5162","The result is not the train wreck one might anticipate from surfing the Net. The catfights, overacting and Berry's swagger in a skimpy, tight, leather outfit that would be right at home at a Hookers Ball make for campy fun.","50","327554"
"5163","All is Lost is more fun to think about than it is to actually watch: It’s a testament to a great actor, an experimental piece of cinema and a bit of a bore.","50","2017038"
"5164","By treating Kevin's evil as a mystery to be solved, Ramsay only succeeds in making what was once allusive banal.","50","1242460"
"5165","Tubman’s case to be on the $20 bill, as a heroine straight out of American myth, is made, a brave Christian woman sprinting down the path of the righteous. Harriet stumbles when it makes her more prophetic and less a woman of action than she was.","50","4648786"
"5166","The movie might work better if the psychological puzzle tucked inside it were more engaging or surprising. But as the pieces fall into place, in a clunky resolution, the story turns as flat as the screens that contain it.","50","7668870"
"5167","Much of the action seems more like warmed-over Quentin Tarantino than first-rate Steven Soderbergh.","50","120780"
"5168","“Caution: Contents may induce brain bleed.” That is, if you think too hard on the logic and mechanics of its time-travel conceit.","50","452694"
"5169","With Manhunter, there seems to be some danger that style has overrun content, leaving behind a vast, chic, well-cast wasteland. [15 Aug 1986]","50","91474"
"5170","Adds more cosmic cliff-hangers than it resolves, and it's not as satisfying as the original. A star war can be an exhausting bit of business, especially when, in the end, it turns out to be something of a cheat.","50","80684"
"5171","Badly dated and clumsily allegorical, The Omega Man has some fairly interesting moments, the most memorable being the view of a devastated, empty downtown Los Angeles.","50","67525"
"5172","It is a spotty, uneven drama in which the entire opening phase representing the basic-training program in a gladiatorial school is lively, exciting and expressive, no matter how true to history it is, and the middle phase is pretentious and tedious, because it is concerned with the dull strife of politics.","50","54331"
"5173","Shrek the Third isn't a movie, it's the extension of a brand.","50","413267"
"5174","A human-interest story that claims spite for human-interest stories, the film has some pretty divisive issues at its core that leave it torn between contrasting approaches.","50","2431286"
"5175","As a non-South African, I can't speak to the accuracy of the movie's racial politics, but they feel insultingly vague.","50","1057500"
"5176","Ten years from now, Beowulf may look like the groundbreaking project that helped kill live-action movies, but for the moment, its uncomfortable jokes and fakey rendering of life leave it wedged firmly in the uncanny valley. (Insert your own joke about Jolie's astonishing animated anatomy here.)","50","442933"
"5177","For every haunting sequence in The Happy Prince, there’s five that redundantly wallow in Oscar Wilde’s misery, which is Rupert Everett’s point, but it becomes wearisome.","50","2404639"
"5178","While literate and coherent in digest-of-history terms, the chronicle of Gandhi's remarkable career as a mass political organizer and spiritual inspiration distilled from the biographical record by Attenborough and screenwriter John Briley remains grievously doting and squeamishly evasive.","50","83987"
"5179","Kassovitz can't control the ridiculous script and messy tone. And though it's not exactly hard to watch Berry run around in a hospital robe (Cruz and Berry: That's one good-looking mental ward), it's not particularly profound.","50","348836"
"5180","It is a very expensive-looking, very flashy entertainment, albeit one that groans under the weight of clumsy storytelling in the second half and features some of the most godawful dialogue this side of ""Attack of the Clones.""","50","499549"
"5181","For those seeking guilty laughs and shameless camp, The Boy Next Door is the exact right kind of bad movie. It’s full of unintentional laughs, and transcendently unselfconscious.","50","3181822"
"5182","Elizabeth inspires empathy, but it often feels like we’re being told to feel a certain way by being shown so much rather than being allowed to naturally warm up to her.","50","5881892"
"5183","While Cruise is more than adequate in a part that demands ""Top Gun""-style histrionics rather than subtle characterization, the drawbacks of this movie are ultimately overwhelming. After all, entertainment made too difficult is no longer particularly entertaining. [24 May 1996, p.L21]","50","117060"
"5184","A choppy, incoherent science-fiction thriller that does no credit to its expensive cast. [13 February 1998, p. 57]","50","120184"
"5185","The standard defense of such material is that we are watching “cartoon violence,” but, when filmmakers nudge a child into viewing savagery as slapstick, are we not allowing them to do what we condemn in the pornographer--that is, to coarsen and inflame?","50","1250777"
"5186","A distinguished and able cast headed by Jeremy Irons; beautiful, mostly black-and-white cinematography; and the enchanting Prague backgrounds make for a diverting feature-length eyeful and earful, but the reconstruction of the Kafkaesque worldview never quite takes. [3 Dec. 1991]","50","102181"
"5187","All this is diverting but also borderline dull.","50","258463"
"5188","What was it trying to do? Did it succeed on its own terms? Why did I find myself admiring nearly every external element of the film — performances, lighting, editing, costuming — and yet find Guadagnino’s extremely aesthetically pleasing assemblage of these same elements into a whole somehow drab?","50","1034415"
"5189","The troubled actor delivers a performance very few could pull off as a depressed father who begins communicating through a hand puppet, but Foster doesn't know how to manage it or navigate the script's seismic tonal shifts, and ends up producing a film that's deeply strange, yet incapable of leaving an impression.","50","1321860"
"5190","Jackson is merely indulging himself here, too, doing a thing not because he should but because he can. And maybe that's a good reason but not good enough. The girl still cries, the ape still dies and all you're left with is a ringing in your ears.","50","360717"
"5191","Choreographed by long-term Li collaborator Corey Yuen, the martial arts confrontations supply plenty of spark, though they lack the more exhilarating stylistic flourishes of those in ""Romeo.""","50","306685"
"5192","One Flew over the Cuckoo 's Nest is an earnest attempt to make a serious film. But in the end the movie backs away from both the human reality and the cloudy but potent symbolism that Ken Kesey found in the asylum.","50","73486"
"5193","The super-hip style is groovy but doesn't mask the fact that Son of Rambow doesn't really go anywhere special or say anything much. For a film about falling in love with the movies, its insights on them are next to nil.","50","845046"
"5194","A little less fascination with computer tricks, and a little more application of human intelligence could have done The Arrivala world of good. [31 May 1996]","50","115571"
"5195","They've interspersed laugh-out-loud segments with dry, repetitive material.","50","415306"
"5196","In a boxing soap-opera way, Eastwood is trying to do for himself as a performer what Sergio Leone did for him in a spaghetti-western way: douse his rough-hewn banality with reflected emotional coloration.","50","405159"
"5197","As high camp, Willard might have something going for it, but not as a horror movie.","50","310357"
"5198","The Avengers has a knockout final 30 minutes, all gee-whiz crash and bang and eye candy that makes grand use of 3D and IMAX and all the other toys. But the Transformers movies did that, too.","50","848228"
"5199","This slick, sick remake of the 1977 Wes Craven cult shocker is more of a glum bummer than a horror show.","50","454841"
"5200","Harlem Nights isn't the embarrassing vanity production it might have been, there's still not a lot to be said for it.","50","97481"
"5201","When the film version isn't assaulting you with gizmos, it's an awkward, depersonalized piece of hackwork.","50","120903"
"5202","The premise of Jason X is silly but strangely believable.","50","211443"
"5203","Scorsese's style, fierce as it is, doesn't accomplish what he clearly expected of it. Often, in many arts, fresh treatment can redeem familiar subjects, but it doesn't happen here. [Oct 22, 1990]","50","99685"
"5204","You won't find many surprises in the equally funny U.S. remake from producer and star Chris Rock.","50","1321509"
"5205","Following the clues, The Other Guys turns more hectic than antic, and somebody didn't pack enough comedy for this long trip.","50","1386588"
"5206","I can't imagine what attracted these two megahunks to such a bore.","50","1571222"
"5207","I appreciate No Country for Old Men for the skill in the film craft. I understand No Country for Old Men for its penetrating disquisition on narrative conventions and its heroic will in subverting them. I admire No Country for Old Men for the way it tightens its grip as it progresses, taking us deeper and deeper into a hellish world. I just don't like it very much.","50","477348"
"5208","Not so much a movie as a self-contained world for like-minded people who wear their outsider status on their sleeves.","50","173716"
"5209","LawAbiding Citizen smells a bit musty these days. Indeed, in an era when the debate has shifted from too little state vigilance to too damn much, this thing seems almost quaint.","50","1197624"
"5210","Why remake a crappy movie five years later if it's only going to be marginally less crappy?","50","800080"
"5211","Despite its director's skill at staging trash with dash, Oldboy is too long and portentous to be an enjoyable B movie. The movie's self-seriousness short-circuits its sensationalism.","50","364569"
"5212","Superman II"" gets off to a fast start (in part by recapitulating the plot of the original film in the credit sequence), only to evolve into a curiously absent-minded follow-up...What seems to have been lost is the straightforward heroic exuberance of the original film, despite Reeve's gallant and endearing efforts. [19 June 1981, p.C1]","50","81573"
"5213","If this vaguely cyberpunk, occasionally comic Australian flick were named after its own qualities, it would have been called “Knockoff.”","50","6499752"
"5214","The Hunger Games takes no risks.","50","1392170"
"5215","This movie Mozart seems little more than a wild and crazy music-maker, whose biggest problem was that his compositions had ""too many notes."" And that, as Forman's Mozart might say, ain't much. [20 Sep 1984, p.C1]","50","86879"
"5216","RocknRolla is a copy of a copy of a valuable original, and you know how faint and unintelligible those can be.","50","1032755"
"5217","This circumcised ""Shaft"" plays half-awesome, half-aw-shit; it exists almost as if to prove you can cram every Jewish joke in the Old Testament into a single movie.","50","317640"
"5218","The non-judgmental state, in which the wrecking of a family is treated like a natural disaster for which there is no human responsibity or possiblity of control, is also true to the spirit of the society the film depicts. But it makes the film, like the marriage itself, seem irritatingly thoughtless. [19 Feb 1982, p.4]","50","84675"
"5219","A fast-starting film that quickly piles meta, self-referential elements on top of each other until they no longer make much sense, and the whole thing collapses under the weight of its own coolness.","50","1262416"
"5220","The thrill is most certainly not in the script by David Koepp, written from Michael Crichton's novel....Most of the writing is the blandest sort of twaddle, jokes you can practically recite along with actors.","50","119567"
"5221","Martin Campbell, though a capable director of action (Hal's training session with the Michael Clarke Duncan-voiced Kilowog is proof of that), doesn't have a poet's instincts.","50","1133985"
"5222","It is nonetheless imaginative in a highly familiar and ultimately tedious way.","50","1142977"
"5223","Like most of Apatow's work, Knocked Up walks a perilous line between sarcasm and sentimentality, and though it's extremely funny in bursts, the movie flirts once too often with schmaltz before toppling into melodrama in its third act. The fault lies as much with Apatow's casting as his writing.","50","478311"
"5224","If we're going to be honest, we need to look inside and ask ourselves: Do we really want to see a listless movie about a woman whose dream is to move into a double-wide trailer?","50","978759"
"5225","Atonement fails to be anything more than a decorous, heavily decorated and ultimately superficial reading of the book on which it is based.","50","783233"
"5226","Coraline is distinguished, if you can call it that, by a creepiness so deep as to seem perverse, and the film finally succumbs to terminal deficits in dramatic energy, narrative coherence and plain old heart.","50","327597"
"5227","The story ceases to make sense. It sounds clever on paper, but on screen it degenerates into a series of random scenes that don't connect until, by the end, there are more questions than answers, and more goo than resolution. [03 Feb 1995, p.J]","50","113409"
"5228","For a good 40 minutes or so in the middle of this movie, De Palma is in his element.","50","183523"
"5229","Watchmen is indeed gorgeous, with Gibbons' original work reproduced and – in some cases – improved upon by detailed F/X, but even at a healthy two hours and 41 minutes the story feels truncated. Even abrupt.","50","409459"
"5230","For all the powerful relevance of its subject, Denial, directed by Mick Jackson from a script by David Hare, never finds its grip. It’s a curiously awkward and slipshod movie that winds up being about nothing so much as the perverse, confounding eccentricities of the British legal system.","50","4645330"
"5231","For all that it may come out of Africa, the film's final destination is not many miles from Disneyland.","50","89755"
"5232","It's possible to be dazzled by a movie and still not like it very much.","50","118749"
"5233","The movie is ungainly – you can almost see the chalk marks it's not hitting. But it has a loose, likable shabbiness. [19 Oct 1987, p.110]","50","93779"
"5234","By the end, mother! is easy to admire for its ambition, but even easier to laugh at for its execution.","50","5109784"
"5235","A fine ensemble piece, but a maddening and unjustified length.","50","1084950"
"5236","The Aviator could've been a ""Raging Bull"" brother film, given that masterpiece's crystalline purity of purpose and humiliated courage. But it brakes far short.","50","338751"
"5237","The always strong Gunn does her best with the very familiar, quickly paced storyline.","50","3958780"
"5238","Casual familiarity with Lyne's oeuvre is all you need to predict the major plot contortion.","50","250797"
"5239","This romantic-comedy action movie is a fizzle.","50","356910"
"5240","Where Scream 3 triumphs is in its wacky, take-no-prisoners, I am a Juggernaut of Terror, Hee, Hee attitude, which wisely makes room for some downright surreal moments amongst the carnage.","50","134084"
"5241","Looks and flows great, dripping with the 1940s crime-thriller atmosphere that James Ellroy described in his 1987 novel. On other levels -- plot (overstuffed), suspense (muted), acting (Hilary Swank as a femme fatale? Please!), posing (Scarlett Johansson plays dress-up as a mini Lana Turner), sex (it's all before and after) -- the movie is a bust.","50","387877"
"5242","Every element of La La Land is bound up in a referentiality that largely precludes the outpourings of emotion we come to musicals for.","50","3783958"
"5243","But the later Rocky movies have been low on inspiration and eager to repeat the same formula, in which everything leads up to a climactic fight scene and a triumphant fadeout. Stallone is smart enough that he could have made this series into a meditation on sports celebrity in America, but that theme has always been at the edge of the stories; the formula takes center ring. If Rocky seems to be running on autopilot, that's also the case for the other characters. [16 Nov 1990, p.49]","50","100507"
"5244","In a time when awareness and acknowledgement of racial bias and extrajudicial measures by law enforcement in America is at its most widespread, such scenes feel condescendingly pitched to an unconverted audience of the imagination.","50","4916630"
"5245","Nothing that suggests an independent vision, unless you count seeing more limbs blown off than usual.","50","120815"
"5246","Will ultimately be remembered more for the trademark Anderson look than for any of its characters or any emotional impact.","50","362270"
"5247","Shows her transition to sobriety as many ensemble stories do--mainly through the development of other characters, the quirkier the better.","50","191754"
"5248","Ultimately, though, the film is forgettable even by the standards of prefabricated pop ephemera.","50","120347"
"5249","Funnier than any movie called Hot Tub Time Machine has a right to be. And how funny is that? Not very, but a little, occasionally – just enough.","50","1231587"
"5250","There's talent here, but for directing, not writing. If Ritchie wants to last, he's going to have to allow somebody else to write his screenplays.","50","208092"
"5251","It must be said that the closing sequence, in which Arthur meets the misbegotten Mordred on an orange battlefield illuminated by a shield-sized red sun, is an epic, Oedipal masterpiece of authentic mythic power, a sequence so strong it shakes the torpor from one's shoulders and induces regret that the rest of the saga has been so juvenile, so lifeless and so lacking poetry or Shakespearean sweep. [11 April 1981]","50","82348"
"5252","Mistaken-identity shenanigans and gooey romance are Monte Carlo's prime commodities.","50","1067774"
"5253","The appeal of the Friday the 13th cycle is difficult for any one whohas not seen the movies on a Saturday night in a packed theatre tounderstand: they are an exercise in collective adolescent camp. As eachvictim falls to Jason's wrath, the kids cheer and laugh, and the gorierthe death, the better. By the standards of that audience, part four isperfection: there are more gruesome homicides than Pauline had perils. [17 Apr 1984]","50","87298"
"5254","Poetic Justice is much more self-indulgent and self-consciously arty and shows [Singleton's] directorial inexperience in almost every scene. [23 Jul 1993]","50","107840"
"5255","Nolan may want us to believe in the darkness that lurks within each of us, but instead of leading us to it visually, he chops it up and sets it out in front of us, a grim, predigested banquet.","50","468569"
"5256","It is occasionally a first-rate action spectacle, but it is only the spectacle that merits recommendation.","50","438488"
"5257","A decent ride. It has a boogeyman, exploding teen-agers and blood by the vat; it's part of the oeuvre. It is also, alas, no significant advance of the sub-genre some of us feel, however improbably, attached to. Teens-and- slash may be a form full ofhack work and dim bulbs, but so long as that form stays within reach of young and relatively unsullied directors, there is hope. [6 March 1985, p.C5]","50","87800"
"5258","Queen & Slim does a disservice to both the themes of love and anger by never giving the latter the depth it deserves, leaving the film a beautiful object to behold but a hollow narrative to consider.","50","8722346"
"5259","If Soderbergh set out to make a galvanizing conversation piece, he has certainly succeeded. But this cold, occasionally dull movie practically defies you to embrace it.","50","307479"
"5260","Much of the movie seems wired and overeager when it ought to be refreshing and relaxed. Everybody sweats and strains to be magical, and while they often succeed, the onslaught of so much aggressive charm is exhausting.","50","102057"
"5261","One may feel dissatisfied by the 11th-hour turn toward lyrical fatalism, and mildly insulted by the presumptuous attitude it seems to choose as it sends us on our way.","50","2234003"
"5262","In filming this movie with such artistic precision, the movie ironically winds up objectifying Griet just as much as any appreciator of the original painting.","50","335119"
"5263","Some moments still work after the movie grows mawkish.","50","2170593"
"5264","For all this Snow White's visual ornamentation, there's no sense of narrative priority - the filmmakers can't see the Dark Forest for the trees.","50","1735898"
"5265","Somewhere along the line, someone seems to have thought this was ''Last Tango in Paris'' all over again. It ain't. [19 Aug 1994, p.C3]","50","109456"
"5266","Dull it is not, but Wong's trademark sense of romantic melancholy fails to jell amid all the excess, and the film turns frankly silly once the mute starts imagining himself in love with a can of sardines. [21 Jan 1998, Pg.37]","50","112913"
"5267","Here, there's not much that's funny, there's too much that's too clever by half, and there's not a damn thing that's lively - this is a film about Life whose sin is its lifelessness.","50","383028"
"5268","In writer-director Ari Aster's smugly agitating feature debut, the devil is certainly in the hackneyed details.","50","7784604"
"5269","For all its immersion in the roar, grease and danger of Formula One, the fact-based Rush — about the sport's great rivalry of the 1970s — is also more predictable than a pit stop, something well-suited to Mr. Howard. He's made perfectly palatable pictures, but never a truly great one, partly because he has such a weakness for the commercial and a consequent gift for the obvious.","50","1979320"
"5270","A few good laughs but few surprises in Next Friday, an amiably unfocused sequel.","50","195945"
"5271","The latter half, set in the less visited parts of New York's subway system, bogs down considerably, abandoning its hybrid approach and becoming content to simply clone Aliens.","50","119675"
"5272","Innerspace suffers from a problem afflicting many of this summer's movies: excess. First, it's too long. Then director Joe Dante (Gremlins) piles on the gadgetry and the inside-the-body special effects, and the movie buckles. [1 July 1987, p.D1]","50","93260"
"5273","Though he is a master thief with a heart of gold, the new Templar has all the charm of one of those ladies behind the counter at the Department of Motor Vehicles.","50","120053"
"5274","Creed wants all of the Rocky drama but invests in none of the smarts.","50","3076658"
"5275","Days of Heaven leaves one wanting more: either a totally revolutionary approach to pictorial storytelling or traditional dramatic interest....It may be artistic suicide for Malick to continue his style of pictorial inflation without also enriching his scenarios. If he doesn't, he's likely to be remembered not for his undeniable pictorial talent but for his eccentricity. [5 Oct. 1978, p.B10]","50","77405"
"5276","Pattinson could have the makings of a brilliant career, something more than the hot streak he's got going as the ""it"" guy of the moment. The same problems plague the film, which is beautifully shot but its emotional potential unrealized.","50","1403981"
"5277","A no-frills, workmanlike picture.","50","95271"
"5278","It's so shameless, so psychotically nervous about keeping you ''thrilled,'' that the phrase over the top won't do it justice. It's like a drug designed for people who've done every drug and now want to be jet-propelled into numbness.","50","118880"
"5279","Woo's aggressive, cartoony attack in the film, which makes for its biggest delights, also wipes out whatever chance it might have had of making an emotional impact.","50","120755"
"5280","Shyamalan remains as coolly unstirred by sex as he was in his previous movies--an astounding indifference, given the historical entwining of eros and fright. Even more bizarre is the gradual draining of humor from his work; the anatomy of horror demands a tongue in the cheek to go with the baring of teeth, but much of The Village is a proud and sullen affair.","50","368447"
"5281","Call it ""Rosemary's Nephew."" Or, simply call The Devil's Advocate a muddled metaphysical thriller that takes a small eternity to engage the observer with its flimsy characters and its tired special effects.","50","118971"
"5282","Though director Nicholas Hytner does his best to enliven the material, Bennett very much comes across as a dull man’s Charlie Kaufman, even more so when the movie ends with flat, unearned whimsicality. Good as she is here, Smith must cede this round to Dench.","50","3722070"
"5283","Gleefully confrontational in its ludicrous, pulpy tawdriness.","50","164052"
"5284","Film critics are put in a difficult position when they see a movie that's well-made but features characters so unbelievably odious you wouldn't want to spend two minutes with them in real life.","50","117802"
"5285","A convincing, reasonably co-ordinated action movie. Nothing special, but lovers of the genre will enjoy the workouts, especially if they bring night-vision glasses.","50","1186367"
"5286","The movie crosses the line between offering mindless entertainment and insulting our intelligence.","50","337921"
"5287","And this is the weakness of the film. Mr. Bolt has reduced the vast upheaval of the Russian Revolution to the banalities of a doomed romance.","50","59113"
"5288","Hollywood is notorious for giving its second-best roles to women, and the situation clearly hasn't changed when a superficial romp like Postcards From the Edge represents the best a major studio can come up with in exploring women's issues. [25 Oct 1990, p.14]","50","100395"
"5289","Wolfgang Petersen's popcorn epic doesn't fail exactly. It just takes on too much. Modern man is at something of a disadvantage-even aided by his trusty muse, the computer-when presuming to bring the stuff of gods, myths and timeless sacred texts to the big screen.","50","332452"
"5290","A mediocre fright-fest.","50","195714"
"5291","It's about half as much fun as the original.","50","266915"
"5292","Paul Verhoeven's RoboCop is a stylish piece of work that leaves a sour aftertaste. [17 Jul 1987]","50","93870"
"5293","It is just plain talky and boring. You know there's something wrong with a movie when the last third feels like the last half.","50","66921"
"5294","An intelligent story for the kilts-and-corsets crowd.","50","119280"
"5295","Forget about a stake through the heart: sheriff Josh Hartnett discovers that decapitation is the best way to stop the bloodsuckers, who suggest feral, steroid-crazed gymnasts as they scale buildings and leap onto moving vehicles.","50","389722"
"5296","Its screenplay veers in highly questionable directions before reaching a mean-spirited climax that outweighs Ron Howard's workmanlike filmmaking and the contributions of a star-powered cast.","50","131369"
"5297","Mythology has rarely been so preachy in a tedious Hollywood style.","50","116136"
"5298","As spine-tingling as a number of individual scenes are, the film struggles to find a proper rhythm. Scene-to-scene transitions are static and disjointed, settling into a cycle of “…and then this happened” without deepening the overall dread or steadily uncovering pieces of a central mystery. Curiously, It grows less intense as it goes.","50","1396484"
"5299","At times dark and at other times gooey.","50","389860"
"5300","The result is just a bigger, louder, more special effects-laden extension of a franchise that skated on pretty thin ice the first two times around.","50","1086064"
"5301","Darts back and forth from being a psychological thriller to a vaguely metaphysical drama to a fate-driven romance -- it all becomes a blur.","50","225071"
"5302","Indecent Proposal starts out kinky and turns into a languid-and shockingly banal- domestic soap opera.","50","107211"
"5303","Limitless should be so much smarter than it is.","50","1219289"
"5304","As social commentary, Joker is pernicious garbage. But besides the wacky pleasures of Phoenix’s performance, it also displays some major movie studio core competencies, in a not dissimilar way to what “A Star Is Born” presented last year.","50","7286456"
"5305","Unfortunately, as scripter, debuting director Steven Zaillian (who wrote Awakenings) also feels compelled to throw in Karate Kid-type flourishes, a rather stale genre that doesn’t lend itself all that well to chess. The narrative is ruthlessly edited, jumping around in a manner that skips needed exposition and abandons characters.","50","108065"
"5306","While the fourth ""Exorcist"" movie may have unmitigated disaster written all over it, the finished product is somehow sort-of-kind-of not all that bad.","50","204313"
"5307","The plot feels both familiar and far-fetched.","50","1046173"
"5308","It’s not that this material is, or should be, off limits in a movie. But The Diary of a Teenage Girl isn’t exactly “Lolita.” Heller must think that taking a moral stance is tantamount to selling out. Commercially, she may be right. In every other respect, she’s wrong.","50","3172532"
"5309","With its confined setting and its existential predicament, the picture owes an ostensible debt to the likes of Pinter and Kafka and Pirandello -- you know, Six Characters in Search of an Author, or, failing that, just getting the hell out of this weird place.","50","123755"
"5310","Packs a full plate of gasps and giggles.","50","455538"
"5311","This film is an evocative, effective entry into the holiday blood-spray subgenre in its own right. And if it doesn't make your skin crawl ... you probably ate too much Christmas dinner.","50","454082"
"5312","A tonally confused, fitfully entertaining film about a pathologically two-faced man.","50","1045772"
"5313","A little more anger would not have gone amiss in this well-acted but strangely remote slice of Oscar bait","50","7008872"
"5314","It's predictable fluff, sometimes pleasantly so, at others times irritatingly.","50","1412386"
"5315","As if taking a cue from its own title, the movie emphatically sets its sights on the upward trajectory of Brown's career.","50","2473602"
"5316","Fried Green Tomatoes was obviously cooked up with the best of intentions but, like the dish to which it refers, it's rudimentary eats - not quite junk food, but not quite nourishing, either. [03 Jan 1992]","50","101921"
"5317","A lazy coffee-table book of a movie,","50","1129445"
"5318","Feels like the shell of a wonderful story.","50","124315"
"5319","Managing nary a single original idea throughout its 93-minute running time, the film does benefit from a cast of sexy young TV stars who should attract the desired female teen demographic.","50","1265990"
"5320","Water's kinky view of the world has simply been overtaken (hell, swallowed up) by the sheer warp of reality. [13 Apr 1994]","50","111127"
"5321","Destined to be remembered not for its laugh-per-minute ratio, but for breaking a barrier of crudeness in mainstream movies.","50","175142"
"5322","Lucy is a confounding experience, but at a brisk 85 or so minutes, it manages not to outstay its welcome. Those not enamored of Besson's particular brand of Euro-schlock grindhouse existentialism, however, may find their brains more stimulated elsewhere.","50","2872732"
"5323","At once spectacular and inert -- a mosaic impersonating a movie; an empty-shell epic.","50","119485"
"5324","Lake was fab in John Waters's films, especially Hairspray, but Fraser is more adroit in this screwball mode. Lake by now may be too brash and over-the-top for the big screen: too much her own persona. [23 Apr 1996]","50","117104"
"5325","Structurally and narratively amputated, Volume 1 retains head and guts but loses its heart and gams to the second installment. Maybe Tarantino figured that Thurman's legs, as long as the Mississippi, were sufficient to carry this half of a movie.","50","266697"
"5326","As a movie, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone has no inner life -- no pulse -- of its own: It's secondhand.","50","241527"
"5327","The result is a film that plays like a creaking melodrama, with good guys and bad guys and precious little in between.","50","824747"
"5328","A somewhat claggy, uneven work with stiff performances from the leads, both of whom seem to be sleep-talking lines as if they learned them in Yiddish first.","50","1657517"
"5329","Ultra-glossy weepie turns out to be something of a guilty pleasure.","50","174480"
"5330","The non-ending turns the whole movie into an elaborate tease, too creepy to dismiss, too shallow to justify its ""ambiguities.""","50","1441326"
"5331","Lawless outback, shotgun-toting banditos and even roadside crucifixions somehow add up to an experience that’s about as thrilling as your average trip to the post office.","50","2345737"
"5332","An uneven, intermittently thoughtful but largely preachy overview of WikiLeaks' rising influence that has less of an issue determining Assange's character than it does with telling a compelling story.","50","1837703"
"5333","Not sure if you'll enjoy Safety Not Guaranteed? Here's a quick litmus test: how do you feel about watching Mark Duplass, accompanying himself on zither (!), singing a heartfelt song about how ""everyone in the big machine tries to break your heart?""","50","1862079"
"5334","As cute and energetic as it is, The Lego Movie is more exhausting than fun, too unsure of itself to stick with any story thread for too long. The action scenes are enthusiastic, colorful but uninvolving, like an 8-year-old emptying a bucket of plastic blocks.","50","1490017"
"5335","It's as if Dante sought so hard to parrot his producer that he wound up parodying, and all involved should have known better. There's a current of menace to Dante's work that sets him apart from Spielberg, and a measure of innocence in Spielberg's quite apart from anything Dante has done. [8 June 1984, p.1]","50","87363"
"5336","Never boring, often excruciating and occasionally transcendent.","50","203009"
"5337","Watching the film is like getting hooked by a fearful angler who can't successfully reel you in.","50","265349"
"5338","There's a wonderfully sly, farcical verve to these early moments, but it dissipates when the script, with its strains of ""E.T."" and ""The Fly,"" moves into high sci-fi gear.","50","1136608"
"5339","An average slasher picture that meanders indecisively between gore and gags.","50","1232783"
"5340","I felt like I'd been invited to a seven-course dinner, and all seven turned out to be cake – and then the host insisted on delivering a lecture about how cake would bring me closer to God.","50","454876"
"5341","Anyone who appreciates Sylvester Stallone or enjoys the ""Rocky"" movies will find moments to enjoy in Rocky Balboa and will leave the theater reasonably satisfied. It's just good to see the guy, and it's good to revisit the character. And that's everything good to be said for the experience.","50","479143"
"5342","Zootopia takes the cultural practice of posing animals as human characters to queasy new heights.","50","2948356"
"5343","Wastes a ton of potent material.","50","285742"
"5344","As it is, much of this movie is simply incomprehensible, however enthusiastically it was designed and is performed. If it were only a little better, one might even spend some time trying to figure what to make of it. [24 Apr 1985, p.B6]","50","87075"
"5345","Most of the time, Peggy Sue Got Married is either underdeveloped or simply not thought through. The way the film gets Peggy Sue into and out of the past is no less lame than the explanation for Bobby Ewing's recent resurrection in ""Dallas."" So much key information is missing or left uncertified or undramatized that the film appears to have been edited by termites.","50","91738"
"5346","Abraham the writer lets down Abraham the director, and ultimately lets down his stars and Spinotti, too.","50","1490785"
"5347","The first half-hour of Jeepers Creepers is so frightening that it's almost a relief when the movie subsequently collapses into silliness.","50","263488"
"5348","Actor-turned-director Clark Johnson uses the flashy, up-to-the-minute editing and camera stunts action fans expect, but keeps the mayhem on a recognizably human scale — it's big, but not insanely overblown.","50","257076"
"5349","The special effects turn out to be not very special and not very effective, and the movie never achieves the lunatic grandeur of the truly demented. Stargate is strictly for the peanut gallery.","50","111282"
"5350","Formulaic enough to suggest that franchise would be B level at best, a TV series at worst. But it's also just good enough to make you want to watch it, anyway.","50","1189340"
"5351","This is ho-hum, straight-to-video material. And yet, even at its most crawlingly linear, Jackie Brown is diverting. If nothing else, I was diverted by the director's gall at stretching out those vacuous scenes.","50","119396"
"5352","ParaNorman is an amusing but only fitfully involving animated caper.","50","1623288"
"5353","Content to make movies for himself (Malick) that nobody else wants to see as long as he can find someone to foot the bill, he's also an iconoclast searching for significance. So am I, but not 138 minutes worth. Anyone seeking symmetry in this cinematic taffy pull risks emerging from it with a pretzel for a brain.","50","478304"
"5354","Even though it doesn't feel like an appropriate send-off, the lethargy of Star Trek: Nemesis is probably indication enough that the series should end here.","50","253754"
"5355","For the most part this reminded me of a hysterical passenger pushing random buttons in the cockpit of a plunging airplane.","50","366551"
"5356","Superman doesn’t have enough conviction or courage to be solidly square and dumb; it keeps pushing smarmy big emotions at us—but half-heartedly. It has a sour, scared undertone.","50","78346"
"5357","Sanders and DeMicco’s script doesn’t have the robust plotting, consistent wit or flavorful character development of the best family animation. And some of the voice actors have too little to work with.","50","481499"
"5358","The entire Nightmare on Elm Street oeuvre has been hailed by critics as a fascinating exercise in id projection and Freudian cant, which helps explain why criticism is in low regard. A better reason to see Dream Warriors, if indeed there is one, is that it's really pretty gross and neat. [06 Mar 1987, p.D2]","50","93629"
"5359","The movie is well-acted, but it's as talky as if it were written for the stage, with fatally slow pacing. Strictly for hard-core Sayles fans and maybe for lovers of American roots music.","50","829193"
"5360","It's hard not to admire Zeitlin's ambitious vision, his do-it-yourself aesthetic, and the commitment of his cast and crew - a kind of utopian collective whose jobs often overlapped, as the local, nonprofessional actors collaborated on set-building and other technical tasks. But that doesn't mean the result of their labor is exactly what you'd call a ""good movie.""","50","2125435"
"5361","Outside of its admiration for mothers, Bier’s film seems to only vaguely hint at other ephemeral ideas, and as a result Bird Box is a curiously hollow experience.","50","2737304"
"5362","The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is as violent and gruesome and blood-soaked as the title promises -- a real Grand Guignol of a movie. It’s also without any apparent purpose, unless the creation of disgust and fright is a purpose. And yet in its own way, the movie is some kind of weird, off-the-wall achievement. I can’t imagine why anyone would want to make a movie like this, and yet it’s well-made, well-acted, and all too effective.","50","72271"
"5363","Fracture may be smarter than the majority of movies out there, but it's not half as clever as it thinks it is.","50","488120"
"5364","There are two drawbacks here. One is a shortage of superior zombies, although where one goes to rent extra zombies I have no idea...Second, we have a serious shortage of fright. [30 June 2003, p. 102]","50","289043"
"5365","An overwrought and ultimately silly thriller.","50","800240"
"5366","McGrath makes literal what the other movie only hinted at -- that Perry falls in love with Capote -- turning the relationship between author and subject into something far less complicated and more mundane.","50","420609"
"5367","Eastwood gutsily stages the extended opening slowly and methodically... [But u]nintentional yuks litter an otherwise somber political thriller adapted from David Baldacci's novel.","50","118548"
"5368","Alternately daring and dull, inventively animated, intimate and yet impersonal, it’s challenging enough to turn off most.","50","2401878"
"5369","Watching this movie is like listening to Michael Jackson tell you what real men are like.","50","1155056"
"5370","Mr. Mann may well become a very good theatrical film maker but, among other things, he's going to have to learn how to edit himself, to resist the temptation to allow dialogue that is colorful to turn, all of a sudden, into deep, abiding purple. Time after time scenes start off well and slip into unintentionally comic excess.","50","83190"
"5371","On their own, individual scenes are effective enough in semi-farcically portraying the ignorance, avoidance and/or downright denial by the practitioners of bad loans. Together, however, they are wearying in their repetitive nature.","50","1596363"
"5372","As the film spirals outward from its central relationship to delve into other characters’ hidden pasts, the story becomes too unwieldy and fragmented for the audience to develop a comprehensive understanding of Callum Turner's Thomas or his personal evolution.","50","460890"
"5373","Call Me by Your Name isn’t so much a bad movie as a dull, bloated one, a tale of teen sexual intensity drawn out beyond the point of holding our interest, footnoted with all these spoken (repeatedly, by one and all) provisos — “This is OK because…” That’s all well and good, but I found it lacking as drama (no parental conflict), romance and period piece, a turgid potboiler overheated under the Tuscan sun.","50","5726616"

"5383","Elm Street 4' does have an endless onslaught of astonishing, often grotesque special effects .Mr. Harlin only has to keep things moving, which he does with restless camera work, swirling high above Freddy and his victims. Freddy, who says I am eternal, seems to be a self-fulfilling prophecy, immune to directors and scripts.","50","95742"
"5384","The sweetest thing about Sweet November (a remake of the 1968 movie) is the on-screen magic between Charlize Theron and Keanu Reeves. But that's pretty much where the magic ends.","50","230838"
"5385","Lacks the energy and urgency of its source material.","50","120681"
"5386","It's the usual undisciplined, overextended Spike symphony: more fun than it is any good.","50","307901"
"5387","The film's problems lie with the lack of spark between a wired Dunst and a bland Bloom, and the meltdown of Drew's mother (Susan Sarandon), who grieves by tap-dancing.","50","368709"
"5388","Less magic also means less fun and discovery, as Harry battles depression and a hostile press; this is the bleakest Potter installment to date, and under David Yates's choppy direction, Maggie Smith, Emma Thompson, Brendan Gleeson, and David Thewlis have little more than walk-ons.","50","373889"
"5389","The film hardly aims to be serious entertainment, and, to its credit, it's never uninteresting visually.","50","493464"
"5390","On the plus side, the casting is superb - and the acting, too. Although the context is overwrought and the moviemaking over-the-top, Washington acts from the ticker out.","50","328107"
"5391","This is a guy movie, a gothic creepshow.","50","264616"
"5392","There might be a great movie to be made out of the financial crisis, but 99 Homes, which is like being shouted at by a man with bad breath while he grips your collar with both hands, isn’t it.","50","2891174"

"5396","This latest adaptation of the Charlotte Brontë novel is careful, respectful and even enjoyable, and yet dry, singularly humorless and played without the lavishness of spirit that makes sense of Gothic melodrama.","50","1229822"

"5398","A dark slice of sword and sorcery that could have used some of Walt's old storytelling sense. [13 July 1981, p.81]","50","82288"
"5399","If the movie is not as dangerous as its detractors claim, neither is it as glorious and memorable as some of its less discriminating admirers would have it. I find the spectacle fading from my memory in a jumble of dislocated colors and motions. In retrospect, it seems too studiously unreal.","50","80120"
"5400","Fitfully interesting, occasionally cringe-worthy, this is the sort of stagy production that mixes ribaldry and campy overacting that evokes summer theatre productions.","50","824758"
"5401","The gradual dilution of fresh humor is further undercut by a queasy sense that the picture, in the end, is quietly endorsing all the psychoanalytical mumbo jumbo that it has been poking fun at all along.","50","122933"

"5411","Jonathan Demme's Philadelphia labors ambitiously on two socially conscious fronts - relating the story of an AIDS-afflicted lawyer while exploring a much broader issue.Unlike almost any other Demme movie - it's a film where you feel the gears struggling to mesh.

"5412","Coprophiliacs looking for a movie that really rings their chimes will be positively tintinnabulating from this arthouse horror number.","50","1467304"
"5413","The two leads’ clashing styles might work if the film were entirely about two superficially similar people’s inability to truly find common ground. But as we’re finally intended to judge their meeting a profound connective one on at least some levels, the chemistry simply feels off.","50","3416744"
"5414","I deferred to the wisdom of Grouchy Smurf (George Lopez): ""I didn't hate it as much as I expected to. But I still hated it.""","50","472181"
"5415","But the stuff looks like what it is -- trite imagery grafted over the narrative barrens, like a bad weave on a balding pate.","50","120324"
"5416","There is a parade of roadside set pieces involving may different ways to crash cars. Overlaid is citizens band radio jabber (hence, the title) which is loaded with downhome gags. Field is the hottest element in the film.","50","76729"
"5417","The only thing missing from the film -- which is frequently amusing but too bleak to be consistently laugh-out-loud funny -- is a genuine connection with its audiences, or at least those audiences not raised in 1960s Jewish suburbia.","50","1019452"
"5418","Skillfully sketches the parameters of its small-town existence but never quite fleshes out the inhabitants of those parameters. Without the well-considered humor and strongly defined characters of ""Chuck,"" only a good cast stands between Girl and some familiar stereotypes.","50","279113"
"5419","A movie worth seeing, worth mulling over, but not necessarily enjoyed.","50","2798920"
"5420","These are hardly damsels, but the distress will be felt by audiences watching the collection of non sequiturs, twee remarks and tangential vignettes that is Damsels in Distress.","50","1667307"
"5421","Notes on a Scandal is a wobbly film that never settles on its tone or, perhaps more precisely, its voice. It can't figure out what kind of movie it wants to be: a high-camp melodrama, a realistic psychological portrait of a troubled female friendship, or a vampire-lesbian horror film.","50","465551"
"5422","Just a series of episodes: it has no trace of the structure that has supported drama and comedy for two millennia.","50","375173"
"5423","Perhaps it is not supposed to be clear; perhaps the movie's air of confusion is part of its paranoid vision. There are individual moments that create sharp images (shock troops drilling through a ceiling, De Niro wrestling with the almost obscene wiring and tubing inside a wall, the movie's obsession with bizarre duct work), but there seems to be no sure hand at the controls.","50","88846"
"5424","Lara’s appealing enough in humor and drive but Vikander brings deeper notes than the script and green screens require, from sorrow and fear to first-kill horror. Tomb Raider isn’t a place to expect good acting even from an Oscar winner, but Vikander persists.","50","1365519"
"5425","For all his years doing ""E.R."" and other top-line TV series, Mr. Wells hasn't yet tailored his techniques to the big screen.","50","1172991"

"5429","Anthony Hopkins and Antonio Banderas work with professional skill in a ludicrous vehicle.","50","120746"
"5430","The Love Witch has an air of geeky satire. The presentational acting style is so self-aware you almost expect the cast to occasionally underline a joke by turning toward the camera and winking at the audience (no one does, though).","50","3908142"
"5431","Franco has a fan’s affection for Wiseau’s mannerisms, but if his objective was to lionize him as an outsider auteur à la Ed Wood, then he’s failed. The idea that The Room’s strange and bitter qualities are very personal and rooted in some deep pain is obvious to anyone who’s seen the film—except, it seems, to the star and director of this movie.","50","3521126"
"5432","Haneke has delivered the Haneke film that Haneke-haters see in their heads when they think of a Haneke film: a series of disjointed, narratively oblique episodes showing people being inhumane to each other.","50","5304464"
"5433","An elaborately worked-over opus that's as tarted-up and artificial as Scorsese's '70s classic Mean Streets was gritty and real, Gangs of New York feels like a movie musical without the songs.","50","217505"
"5434","There is a great deal more style than substance here. The special effects experts and the other members of the technical crew do their considerable best to give their various hacking sequences the look of warp-speed sci-fi fantasy.","50","113243"
"5435","Unfortunately, the operative word is bland, as the newcomers don't add much to the formula, leaving it to their nemeses to enliven the proceedings. Narrative drive and humor are also in short supply, which creates a serious sagsag in the middle when the novelty of the fresh components has mostly worn off.","50","118688"
"5436","Never enough goodies to keep the two-hour running time from seeming like three.","50","241303"
"5437","Bridesmaids is bipolar filmmaking at its most disconcerting, with changes in tone so abrupt that they can cause whiplash. In part because of this and in part because the writing is often lazy and self-indulgent, the movie rarely works.","50","1478338"
"5438","Shakespearean in tone, epic in scope, it seems more appropriate for grown-ups than for kids. If truth be told, even for adults it is downright strange.","50","110357"
"5439","Midnight Run is two films. One is a succession of bright, razor-edge, nutty dialogues between two men. The other is the plot that keeps them together, which is stale and full of boring violent-comic action. [29 Aug 1988]","50","95631"
"5440","Mendes doesn't care about people -- he's too busy making his art. And with Jarhead he pulls off, effortlessly, what so many pro-and antiwar individuals since Vietnam have tried so conscientiously to avoid: His movie is antiwar and anti-soldier.","50","418763"
"5441","Like a light buffet of tasty morsels rather than a full and satisfying meal; all the episodes are more or less agreeable, but as a whole it lacks a knockout punch, one dynamite sequence that will galvanize viewers.","50","120910"
"5442","Foster is fine, but the story's outcome would seem a tad more uncertain if another actress had the part. How scary are three New York tough guys when you've handled Hannibal Lecter in your time?","50","258000"
"5443","Science fiction movies don't come much more ponderous than the beautifully filmed Never Let Me Go, which reduces the debate over genetic engineering to a mild, moist romantic soap opera.","50","1334260"
"5444","Superficial when it means to be elliptical and regressive in its attempts to promote pride and tolerance, Sebastián Lelio’s film is beautiful but vacant, the type of melodrama that reminds us that they shouldn’t always make them like they used to.","50","5639354"
"5445","Quaid and Whitaker, who serve more or less as the designated humans in this clockwork contraption of a film, are capable in corny roles, but otherwise Vantage Point is as stuffed with cardboard performances and expositional speeches as any seventies disaster flick.","50","443274"
"5446","Milla Jovovich is not quite up to the task of playing a nuanced and thoughtful Joan.","50","151137"
"5447","The film never reaches a climax because it's always in one, distilling the lives of its characters to their tensest moments.","50","1817273"
"5448","There may be nothing more fun for actors than experimental exaggeration, especially when filming on a Caribbean island. But there’s nothing that makes an audience feel less welcome than not being in on the joke.","50","325980"
"5449","Your mileage with the movie will depend on how much you like these guys to begin with, because even if you're a fan, the one joke premise has a hard time sustaining a full length movie.","50","1245492"
"5450","It’s a long, flat, no-frills journey which struggles to engage despite its many bloody shocks.","50","2316204"
"5451","The tuneful melodies of their favourite band grace the soundtrack, but let's not confuse this with a rock 'n' roll movie -- the music is just the blank canvas awaiting the higher art of the gross-out.","50","165710"
"5452","A below-par star vehicle for Mel Gibson and Julia Roberts, Conspiracy Theory is a sporadically amusing but listless thriller that wears its humorous, romantic and political components like mismatched articles of clothing.","50","118883"
"5453","The movie so successfully raises the emotional and psychological stakes in the first half that not all audiences may like the film's reversion to con-artist form in the second. The con itself is preposterous and full of holes when we think back after the movie.","50","325805"
"5454","The Fourth Kind has a clever gimmick and nothing more.","50","1220198"
"5455","The film shows no interest in the inner workings of a relationship that’s defined by unusual circumstances.","50","5711148"
"5456","The movie lacks majesty. Grand in parts, the movie is too often grandiose or grandiloquent; and the running time is indefensible.","50","903624"
"5457","Mostly it’s a misguided mess.","50","4971344"
"5458","During the heist itself, the suspense is palpable, if only because Christophe Beck's funky score blares its horns so insistently, one can't help but feel anxious. But the laughs don't follow.","50","471042"
"5459","Not quite soaring into the heavens, but not exactly crash-landing either, Cloud Atlas is an impressively mounted, emotionally stilted adaptation of British author David Mitchell's bestselling novel.","50","1371111"
"5460","The film is shockingly light on music and heavy on crime scenes that play as bogus.","50","430308"
"5461","This relentlessly depressing film biography boasts a moving performance by Jessica Lange as Frances Farmer, one of the most beautiful movie actresses of the late 1930s and early 1940s, shown here as the victim of a forceful mother (Kim Stanley) and a tyrannical studio system.","50","83967"
"5462","I realize this is an important movie for Shia LaBeouf, but I’m not convinced it’s an important movie for us.","50","8151874"
"5463","The most memorable scene in Invaders belongs to Louise Fletcher (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest). She also turns in the best performance as the school marm who, after the Martians get to her, gobbles a bullfrog and becomes the movie's gleeful and insane Madame LaFarge. [14 June 1986, p.C6]","50","91276"
"5464","Goldberg has her best role in a while, especially when she twitches and grunts her way into phony trances. Poor Demi, though, cries enough tears to drench a small drought-stricken state. [13 July 1990, Life, p.4D]","50","99653"
"5465","One thrilling shot of land's discovery - so good it's reprised at the end - hints at what might have been. But despite production values that advertise a first-class journey, 1492 is a long haul in steerage. [09 Oct 1992, p.8D]","50","103594"
"5466","Noah Baumbach lobs jokes with hectic editing and a Sturgesian velocity, but much of this cross-generational comedy is frantic and wearisomely superficial.","50","1791682"
"5467","Before long, however, the suspense becomes repetitious and predictable. In its denouement, the film breaks faith with its audience, violating credibility in an attempt to deliver a surprise villain.","50","146336"
"5468","Almost all of its screen time is taken up with explosions, chases, shootouts, heads coming off, folks getting sliced in half -- and the odd thing about it is that after 40 minutes, it's not disturbing anymore. Just dull. [21 Nov 1990, p.E1]","50","100403"
"5469","A decent cast, led by Peter Weller (as the geologist/hero) and Rambo vet Richard Crenna (as Doc), grapples gamely with the script and hauls down the paychecks. [21 Mar 1989, p.C7]","50","97737"
"5470","If it makes anybody feel better, one character in the picture does point out that the whole ""extraordinary rendition"" concept originated with Clinton. So there's balance for you.","50","804522"
"5471","Beguilingly sharp at first, but the later stages, with Fonda's toughie reporter tagging along for a story but going all mushy inside, wallow in sentimentality about integrity, ecology and all that jazz.","50","79100"
"5472","When the separatist compound must accommodate an interloper — Steve Trevor, fished out of the sea by Diana after his plane goes down — any hopes that Wonder Woman will sustain its appealing misandry are soon dashed.","50","451279"
"5473","When you can count the laughs in a comedy on the fingers of one hand, it isn’t so funny. Time Bandits, is a kind of potted history of man, myth and the eternal clash between good and evil as told in the inimitable idiom of Monty Python. Not that the basic premise is bad, with an English youngster and a group of dwarfs passing through time holes on assignment by the Maker to patch up the shoddier parts of His creation. What results, unfortunately, is a hybrid neither sufficiently hair-raising or comical.","50","81633"
"5474","Foster and Harrelson always stick to the Army's orders about what to say and how to behave. After a while, The Messenger starts to feel equally dogged about following a pat script.","50","790712"
"5475","Under Australian director George Miller (""Mad Max""), The Witches of Eastwick begins so promisingly. It has such smashing separate moments, so succulent a cast and so interesting a premise that watching it crumble into stomach-turning crudeness and ""Poltergeist""-scale special effects is deeply painful.","50","94332"
"5476","If you see Clue only once, and it's hard to imagine seeing it more than once, even for the five different minutes, the ""A"" is by far the best, featuring as it does (this does not give away the identity of the murderer) a splendidly funny shtick from Madeline Kahn. [13 Dec 1985, p.D5]","50","88930"
"5477","Like Percy himself, the film doesn’t have any traits that qualify as having an actual personality. Even so, as long as the kiddies aren’t too upset by the major liberties reportedly taken with the source material, it might be enough to distract them until Harry returns.","50","814255"
"5478","An epic work of self-indulgence and smug riffing, stringing together tropes from TV and screen westerns and closed-room whodunits, The Hateful Eight announces itself with all the pomp and circumstance of a mid-century cinema spectacle.","50","3460252"
"5479","There’s not much to Victoria & Abdul, but as a delivery system for Judi Dench, it serves its purpose. Otherwise, it’s just Buckingham Palace fetishism cranked up to peak mumsy.","50","5816682"
"5480","Hurt's character is so inert and unemotional that some spectators may find it difficult to stay interested in him.","50","94606"
"5481","A great title in search of a movie to live up to it, this startlingly uneventful compendium of thick-headed boy-talk and female tolerance squanders a fine cast on incredibly ordinary characters and situations.","50","115639"
"5482","Yet, when it all clicks, Ephron is able to make the familiar sparkle anew. [25 Jun 1993 Pg. 01.D]","50","108160"
"5483","The movie has the metabolism, logic and attention span of a peevish 6-year-old.","50","109040"
"5484","The season's first comet-targets-Earth special effects extravaganza is spectacular enough in its cataclysmic scenes of the planet being devastated by an unstoppable fireball, but proves far from thrilling in the down time spent with a largely dull assortment of troubled human beings.","50","120647"
"5485","Such a glorious cast, deployed to such trivial effect!","50","280707"
"5486","Diablo Cody's glib teen-hip dialogue mostly feels like self-conscious splatter over a sorely lackluster scare flick.","50","1131734"
"5487","In effect, aspects of Gibson's creative makeup -- his career-long interest in martyrdom and the yearning for dramatic conflict that make him an excellent actor, coupled with his belief in the Gospels' literal truth -- have sideswiped this film. What is left is a film so narrowly focused as to be inaccessible for all but the devout.","50","335345"
"5488","Offers only the stingiest platform for its actors, and as a piece of storytelling -- built on the foundation of a great story -- it's an epic that's been sliced and diced into so many little morsels that almost nothing in it has any weight.","50","765429"
"5489","Cronenberg's brand of body horror isn't to everyone's taste, but to call him a reactionary anti-sensualist who metes out grotesque punishment for sins of the flesh -- as detractors have -- is to miss the point.","50","73705"
"5490","The human interest story that occupies fully two-thirds of this three hour plus epic is so flat and unconvincing that, for once, you find yourself longing for the disaster footage to start.","50","120338"
"5491","The leads are both charming, but they can’t override the tooth-aching sincerity of the script, or the cardboard conflicts that propel it.","50","6423362"
"5492","The script is so bereft of real surprises that it's best to keep the lid on what few there are.","50","142688"
"5493","I didn't find “The Jerk” very funny...There's a smarmy undercurrent in this movie that seems to imply that Steve Martin may be playing a jerk, but that we all know what a cool guy he is. Well, if you're going to play a jerk, play one as if you think you are one, or you might wind up looking like a jerk.","50","79367"
"5494","A lazy and mediocre movie, a sort of tepid parody blend of ""The Breakfast Club"" and ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers.""","50","133751"
"5495","A mixed-up and over-loaded American spy thriller by Alfred Hitchcok, with the unengaging Robert Cummings in the lead and an unappealing cast, featuring Priscilla Lane and Otto Kruger. Nothing holds together, but there are still enough scary sequences to make the picture entertaining.","50","35279"
"5496","After a sensational beginning, the movie loses its way in the late going and somehow doesn't deliver. [12 Mar 1999]","50","142192"
"5497","As a result, the film doesn't seem to know what sort of comedy it wants to be -- it comes across as more confused than funny.","50","123964"
"5498","James Franco looks more bored and distracted in Rise of the Planet of the Apes than he did when he was hosting the Oscars: Watching the movie, I kept waiting for him to pull out his iPhone, aim it at the camera and take a snapshot while mugging sheepishly. Has there ever been a film with a less engaged protagonist?","50","1318514"
"5499","If you're looking for Rock's trademark smart-ass wit, you'll want to look somewhere else. Likewise when it comes to a movie with something fresh to say about the balancing act that is wedded bliss.","50","770772"
"5500","Even at its most suspenseful, when Jed Kurzel’s cello score stabs at the eardrums, Overlord feels familiar, a collage of cinematic nightmares checking off its influences.","50","4530422"
"5501","The film doesn’t apply the necessary touch and precision to balance its sleek, chromed parts into a revving whole.","50","6241872"
"5502","Desperately uncertain in tone and able to generate only sporadic laughs, pic decks out its meager story of revenge and comeuppance with a vulgar, flashy shimmer that will no doubt attract teenage girls, or the core ""Clueless"" audience.","50","120032"
"5503","Film at 145 minutes is far over-length, and should be tightened extensively, particularly in first half. After a bang-up and exciting opening, it appears that scripters lost sight of their narrative to drag in Mexican songs, dancing and way of life, plus an overage of dialog, to the detriment of action.","50","65214"
"5504","A pervy premise and top-flight cast yield a mixed-bag spy flick.","50","2873282"
"5505","The plot is lame, but that doesn't matter, because Dumb and Dumber is essentially pitched at the level of an ""Airplane!""-style movie, with rapid-fire sight gags.","50","109686"
"5506","Even with the great Ken Watanabe lending command and compassion to the role of General Kuribayashi, it's a formless slog across a treacherous field.","50","498380"
"5507","Without fully rounded characters, it's hard to care who lives or dies in what amounts to an extended procedural on how disease prevention organizations might respond to such a scenario.","50","1598778"
"5508","Isn't as jaw-droppingly awful as its trailers suggest.","50","486946"
"5509","Using none of the sharp, ironic juxtapositions that lent its predecessors so much energy, Car Wash is content to be just a day in the life of the title establishment. [04 Oct 1976, p.89]","50","74281"
"5510","Makes one long for Martin's edgy work in films such as ""The Spanish Prisoner.""","50","349205"
"5511","Is it worth seeing once? Sure.","50","185183"
"5512","John August's trickily structured script owes an all too obvious debt to ""Pulp Fiction,"" but Liman's film is more like kiddie Tarantino.","50","139239"
"5513","Alas, Little Orphan Damien, lucky enough to be taken in by a rich uncle after bumping off his first pair of foster parents, can’t resist killing the second set, too, along with assorted friends of the family. Damien is obviously wearing out his welcome.","50","77394"
"5514","The screenwriter's signature verbal-diarrhetic dialogue allows for a nonstop blaring of actorly chops that, like the movie at large, is nothing if not committed.","50","2080374"
"5515","Director Hal Ashby’s second feature is marked by a few good gags, but marred by a greater preponderance of sophomoric, overdone and mocking humor.","50","67185"
"5516","In spite of its downbeat subjects, Drugstore Cowboy becomes a satisfying drama of redemption. [27 Oct 1989]","50","97240"
"5517","An adequate horror movie for the Halloween season, but it too easily sinks into haunted-house-film conventions, even if the haunted house is decked out as an Italian luxury liner.","50","288477"
"5518","The first half is full of verbal and visual surprises, but the later scenes are talky and dull, as if filmmaker Steven Soderbergh had lost interest in his subject and his characters. Which would be understandable, since the story often seems more calculated than heartfelt. [4 Aug 1989, Arts, p.10]","50","98724"
"5519","It places regurgitated ideas into the mouths of gifted actors, then drops them amid a kooky story that plays like an elaborate distraction from what little the film actually has to say.","50","2562232"
"5520","Studiously harmless, Disney's long-in-development film rendition pasteurizes the book's renegade verve with typical means.","50","371724"
"5521","A relatively mindless thrill ride that would have made the old NBC execs grin from ear to ear.","50","796366"
"5522","At least in a video game the player decides who needs to be killed, and what trail to take in the labyrinth. The Max Payne moviegoers are passive hostages on a long ride they've taken so many times before.","50","467197"
"5523","Guy Ritchie's Holmes reboot feels both too complicated and too elementary, dear Watson.","50","988045"
"5524","By the end, every child in the audience will want his or her own monster-minion toy. Adults will just regret the way that Despicable Me 2 betrays the original film’s devotion to bad-guy gaiety.","50","1690953"
"5525","A decent piece of do-good cinema...Director Norman Jewison stages their confrontations for effectively flashy, immediate effects, though he unnecessarily neglects the action-movie underpinning.","50","61811"
"5526","Cowboys & Aliens is one of the silliest movies ever made, but so many otherwise serious people have attached their names to it that, as Arthur Miller wrote in Death of a Salesman, attention must be paid.","50","409847"
"5527","Based flimsily on a minor F. Scott Fitzgerald story, it's an anecdote stretched to would-be epic proportions.","50","421715"
"5528","127 Hours, about an unimaginably unbearable experience, is pretty much an unbearable experience of its own. And yet, it must be said, it's exceptionally well made.","50","1542344"
"5529","The first five or 10 minutes of Airplane II -- The Sequel are genuinely funny -- so funny I thought maybe this movie was going to work. That turned out to be a premature hope. The new inspirations quickly run out, and Airplane II turns into a retread, plundering the same situations and characters that made the original Airplane so funny.","50","83530"
"5530","A production in which the bludgeon is employed more often than the gimlet. The result is that this production is, for the most part, extremely noisy without being nearly as mirthful as their other films.","50","23969"
"5531","Though overexplicit and underdeveloped, Clive Barker`s Hellraiser is a horror film with enough personality and ambition to rise slightly above the run of the genre.","50","93177"
"5532","For much of the film, Nolan (who co-wrote with his brother Jonathan) seems to be unafraid to allow this big-budget extravaganza to tell a story that's about pain and loss and melancholy and sacrifice. Until it's not that anymore, and Interstellar becomes thuddingly prosaic.","50","816692"
"5533","Keanu Reeves plays a ""courier"" with a lot of top-secret data stashed in his brain; it's clearly interfering with his minimal acting capabilities, causing several moments of unintentional (but welcome) humor.","50","113481"
"5534","A Single Man, with one significant exception, gives us only a series of immaculate poses.The exception is Firth, who, in spite of Ford's best efforts to turn him, too, into another piece of movable scenery, manages to convey a real human soul stirring beneath George's petrified façade","50","1315981"
"5535","McCarthy and Rob Lowe (as his roommate) carry most of the picture, and both acquit themselves reasonably well under the circumstances.","50","85346"
"5536","The Meddler is a disappointment after the talent Scafaria demonstrated in her 2012 feature debut “Seeking a Friend for the End of the World.”","50","4501454"
"5537","It has to be noted that the use of music in this film is the worse in recent memory: maudlin, syrupy, and overwrought.","50","125439"
"5538","This is pitiful stuff, and, like the violence, it eats away at the blitheness for which Kingsman strives, leaving an aftertaste of desperation that the Connery of “Goldfinger,” say, would not have dreamed of bequeathing. The sadness is that Firth, alone in the film, does raise the spectre of those days, radiating a lightly amused reserve amid the havoc.","50","2802144"
"5539","Fair Game serves up impeccable politics with a bit too much righteous outrage and not quite enough solid drama.","50","977855"
"5540","It’s a film that desperately wants to upend the tropes of the comic book movie, but perhaps more shocking than anything that comes out of the mouth of its often obnoxious titular hero, is how blandly the picture sticks to the origin story playbook.","50","1431045"
"5541","We Bought a Zoo is an odd bird, warm-blooded but largely lifeless.","50","1389137"
"5542","The key to enjoying Sanctum is to look, not listen.","50","881320"
"5543","Flipped succeeds when it backs off the gluey nostalgia and focuses instead on the subtler pitfalls of adolescence - the tough stuff, the moral stuff, the constant tacking between fear and courage.","50","817177"
"5544","When you really think about Breakdown - and believe me, that would probably require spending more time thinking about the movie than the filmmakers did - it doesn't make much sense.","50","118771"
"5545","Nimoy and his writers prefer blandness to satire; an E.T. without toilet training, little Mary has been sent to earth to prove that even playboys have big hearts. A feel-good fantasy for baby boomers, Three Men and a Baby is so aggressively innocuous you may be ready for beddy-bye time long before it's over. [30 Nov 1987, p.73]","50","94137"
"5546","After memorably sealing Ryan Reynolds in a coffin in ""Buried,"" screenwriter Chris Sparling's attempts to make a two-ATM vestibule equally claustrophobic are less inspired.","50","1603257"
"5547","Plenty of surprises, almost all of them nasty.","50","116367"
"5548","The Spielbergian attempt at sweetness--heralded by references in Danny Elfman's score to the Nutcracker Suite--never fully convinces.","50","99487"
"5549","Given the talents, Poltergeist is an annoying film because it could have been so much better.","50","84516"
"5550","The premise of Night at the Museum is definitely a bit more creative than the standard family films we are used to at this time of year, but the problem is that the film is marred with many gags that are outdated and therefore feel cheap.","50","477347"
"5551","Pet Sematary Two' follows the usual horror movie pattern: The first half is a pleasure, because you know what has to happen and you can't wait. And the second half is a bore, because you know what still has to happen and you can't wait for it to end. [01 Sept 1992, p.E3]","50","105128"
"5552","There's just not much going on here once the plot finds its stride. It's goofy, and it's mean, but Darkman isn't nearly enough of either. [24 Aug. 1990, p.5]","50","99365"
"5553","Too bad Boys has more gas than wind beneath its wings. [03 Feb 1995, Pg.04.D]","50","112571"
"5554","The kind of horror movie that's not a bit scary and quite a bit gross.","50","185371"
"5555","Poor, no-respect ABBA gets tweaked repeatedly in this unexpectedly handsome widescreen import - though, in keeping with the movie's soft tone, the gooning isn't mean-spirited or even all that catty. [10 Aug 1994]","50","109045"
"5556","A worthy successor to the original movie, NIGHTMARE PART 2 is surprisingly optimistic and moral. The power of love and kindness wins out over evil and violence--something not often seen in modern horror films.","50","89686"
"5557","In spite of the title, there's nothing particularly ""real"" about Lars And The Real Girl, just a couple layers of quirk several stops removed from the world as we know it.","50","805564"
"5558","The notorious action star keeps his bombastic persona remarkably reeled in, and the resulting film is earnest, somber, and extremely modest -- almost to a fault.","50","985699"
"5559","Steve McQueen's film practically treats Solomon Norhtup as passive observer to a litany of horrors that exist primarily for our own education.","50","2024544"
"5560","While Julieta represents a welcome return to the female-centric storytelling that has earned Almodovar his greatest acclaim, it is far from this reformed renegade’s strongest or most entertaining work.","50","4326444"
"5561","In brief, I fell cheated by these clever, narrative-disrupting films. They seem to miss the point. After all, every fiction film is magical--an artifice devoted to “What if?”","50","453467"
"5562","There’s nothing lost in the translation of Fences, but its high fidelity means there’s little, if any, inspiration to be found within.","50","2671706"
"5563","A bald-faced lamprey hitching its razor-tipped maw on the chassis of The Exorcist, The Omen’s Sunday-school parable of gothic Cathsploitation comes twice as thick and thrice as pious.","50","75005"
"5564","The legacy of Syd Fields's screenwriting manual hangs over 10 Cloverfield Lane, as it does all of Abrams's productions, which never even accidentally casts a whiff of subtext or authorial personality.","50","1179933"
"5565","Aflame with color and awash in symbolism, this undeniably ravishing yet ultimately disappointing haunted-house meller is all surface and no substance, sinking under the weight of its own self-importance into the sanguine muck below.","50","2554274"
"5566","In a textbook example of the have-it-both-ways ethos of self-loathing narcissism, Carell has succeeded in creating a character of old-fashioned decency in a movie that otherwise flouts it at every turn.","50","405422"
"5567","Johnson’s own sleight of hand is estimable, even if his effort to add politics into the crowded mix rings hollow. The machine is what matters here, and he has clearly had such a good time engineering it that it’s hard not to feel bad when you don’t laugh along with him.","50","8946378"
"5568","De Niro's widely praised performance is like the rest of the film: competent, a product of hard work and borderline mechanical. I like much of Awakenings, including several supporting performances - but like Big, it left me just a little cold. [20 Dec 1990, p.5D]","50","99077"
"5569","Until Hollywood stops being a boys club, and America graduates beyond short pants and its embarrassingly pubescent attitudes toward sex, I suppose one can only hope that all male adolescent fantasies will play as goofily sweet as this one.","50","265208"
"5570","Kattan and Ferrell do their best to fill out the shallow Butabis.","50","120770"
"5571","A quarter of the way through the film, it’s all just too much.","50","371257"
"5572","The pulse of Curtis Hanson's direction is lethargic; the comic bits are so slack and deadpan you could mistake the film for an earnest drama--an Afterschool Special for troubled kids and their pooped parents.","50","185014"
"5573","The more you interrogate the premises underlying The Post’s themes, the more they disintegrate. The daunting fact is that only mass movements truly change society for the better. But that’s a messy process with a lot of depressing history built in, and not ideal for narratives catering to prim liberal sensibilities.","50","6294822"
"5574","The efficiency of his (Donaldson) direction renders the movie somewhat characterless, like a top-rank made-for-TV production.","50","146309"
"5575","The film smartly avoids the sort of cynical hijinks that characterize the majority of Vegas-set flicks, though it can't come up with anything more compelling to place in its stead.","50","1262990"
"5576","Rather wan in its anything-goes spirit of invention, the movie has a surprisingly low number of laughs; some of the initial premises are good, but there's very little energy in the follow-through, and this time Murray's listlessness seems more anemic than comic.","50","97428"
"5577","There's something to be said for letting a comic book adaptation operate at the level of a comic book--i.e., with cheap laughs and ice-cold sadism.","50","330793"
"5578","You have to grasp at straws to make even ""poetic"" sense of the narrative.","50","274558"
"5579","Mystery-wise, the film teases viewers pretty effectively, with plenty of jolts that suggest the boys are on the right track balanced by other signs they're making something out of nothing.... But with a couple of small exceptions, attempts to flesh out the teen characters don't work very well.","50","5774450"
"5580","Take Shelter has a problem, the simplest of all problems but no less serious for its being simple. It's a film without suspense and with a slow-moving story that unfolds without surprise or embellishment.","50","1675192"
"5581","One of the more cheerfully dumb thrillers I've seen in a good long while.","50","808151"
"5582","Although it would be understatement to call their characters unsympathetic, Van Der Beek and Sossamon play their parts with such doomed passion that they have some affecting moments.","50","292644"
"5583","for all its flaws, Born on the Fourth of July provides the final proof that Tom Cruise is the real thing-a movie star with all the natural, unforced ability to connect with an audience that the title implies. [20 Dec 1989, p.1]","50","96969"
"5584","Yes, Waititi’s sugary fantasy unearths an endearing quality in the most unlikely places. But in the process, it buries the awful truth.","50","2584384"
"5585","Although it contains funny moments, the deliberately disjointed whole is too cute for its own good.","50","118125"
"5586","Amusing as it is, it never feels real.","50","1119646"
"5587","The trouble, which becomes quickly and oppressively apparent, is that the screenplay has no point except its plot. No theme, no intent of anything like Oliver Stone weight, is ever manifested.","50","120399"
"5588","I'm too big a fan of director James Whale (1896-1957) to take a film about him lightly, and I'm afraid this speculative 1998 movie about his last days won't do.","50","120684"
"5589","An instant merit barometer of any farce this contrived is the creativity in and conviction of the exposition. It takes an empty half-hour just to get Goldberg into the convent, and even then the payoff is mild. [29 May 1992, p.5D]","50","105417"
"5590","Strange, empty movie, a metaphysical Cracker Jack box without a prize in its empty-calorie depths.","50","1385826"
"5591","Somewhere in Time is a glossy, flossy and intermittently interesting piece of kitsch which, with more sensitive craftsmanship, could have been one of the more dazzling screen romances of the year. It's too bad that it's held down by its more overt commercial impulses. [7 Oct 1980, p.1]","50","81534"
"5592","John Carpenter's Prince of Darkness gets off to an intriguing start. But then the movie loses its way.","50","93777"
"5593","While it has its scary moments, and while its central conceit is refreshingly imaginative, there's ultimately not much there there.","50","185937"
"5594","On a technical level, there's a lot to be said for Die Hard. It's when we get to some of the unnecessary adornments of the script that the movie shoots itself in the foot.","50","95016"
"5595","Nevertheless, Bean has been a huge hit in Europe, where it opened last summer, and it may contain enough laughs to work here. Well enough, one hopes, to produce a funnier, sharper, better crafted ""Bean 2."" [07Nov1997 Pg.63]","50","118689"
"5596","Far too complex and provoking.","50","180093"
"5597","Quips alone do not a popcorn-movie star make. In this age of post-steroidal leading men, you don't need to be Arnold Schwarzenegger to carry a movie, but you do need to have some presence.","50","1059786"
"5598","Corny, but not enough for Lynch, who also throws in the escape of a homicidal maniac wrongly imprisoned for the child's murder, and a confusion of red herring conflicts which mark the plot as a poor imitation of John Carpenter's patient terrorism of good by evil. But if you forget motivation, the visual trick-or-treat of slow revenge is entertaining enough: a weirdo janitor dribbling at the window; the victim's year book photos pinned with shards of shattered mirror. Jamie Lee Curtis is superb as Miss Naturally Popular and Prom Queen-to-be, isolated in empty high school corridors.","50","81383"
"5599","Frances Ha feels like a collaboration between two people in love, and not always in the best way. There are too many scenes in a row that make the same point.","50","2347569"
"5600","The tone is consistent, but consistently uneventful. [06 May 1994]","50","106379"
"5601","As a metaphysical exploration of otherworldliness, Jacob's Ladder has a kind of morbid intensity, for those who like that sort of thing. The picture flounders, however, with its insistence on injecting a little politics into the paranormal brew. [1Nov 1990, p.A20]","50","99871"
"5602","Hell itself is going to hell in Sandler's new comedy.","50","185431"
"5603","Good points aside, In Good Company is a bland, occasionally phlegmatic pastiche of cliches and dull encounters.","50","385267"
"5604","Spoiled by its own insatiable desire for envelope-pushing flair; it’s wider-scoped when it should be intimate, splashy instead of subtle, icky but not scary.","50","387564"
"5605","I wouldn't have minded even the Hollywood schlock lurking behind the studied weirdness if I'd believed in any of the characters on any level.","50","272338"
"5606","Lincoln is also a colossal bore. It is so pedantic, slow-moving, sanitized and sentimental that I kept pinching myself to stay awake - which, like the film itself, didn't always work.","50","443272"
"5607","In my cut of the film, it ends after Jones opens the parcel from his son that's been sitting on his kitchen table since shortly after he left. I recommend viewers leave the theater at that point. You won't be sorry that you did.","50","478134"
"5608","The plot is squeezed dry in this bloody Valentine from Hollywood and becomes annoyingly predictable. Thriller stumbles on its own success","50","102926"
"5609","There are lots of hilarious, off-the-wall incidents, and the film has a likable freewheeling spirit to go with its knockabout plot. But the film isn't as remotely funny as it means to be.","50","261392"
"5610","Moments are stretched. Every recollection must be illustrated by a flashback. Character motivations shift on a dime, and if you understand even half of what's going on - not generally, but specifically - you'll be doing better than most.","50","1345836"
"5611","Stolen Summer is no disaster, though. It's merely one more misfire fortunate enough to attract actors like Bonnie Hunt and Aidan Quinn, who almost make it work.","50","286162"
"5612","Welcome to the world of white people problems, ground zero for the strain of American comedies that Apatow does best. But does he really?","50","1758830"
"5613","The shipwreck comes too late to rescue movie from endless banalities. [02 Feb 1996]","50","118158"
"5614","It takes few chances, frequently using sass as a smokescreen, hiding what's unoriginal and cheaply sentimental about this story behind a veil of witticisms about oblivion and ""cancer perks.""","50","2582846"
"5615","Robert Altman's McCabe & Mrs. Miller is a disappointing mixture. A period story about a small northwest mountain village where stars Warren Beatty and Julie Christie run the bordello, the production suffers from overlength; also a serious effort at moody photography which backfires into pretentiousness; plus a diffused comedy-drama plot line which is repeatedly shoved aside in favor of bawdiness.","50","67411"
"5616","Cotillard, with stringy long hair and a coal fire of severity in her eyes, has what it takes to play a woman who feels that she's lost everything. But she's forced to flail and mood-swing from scene to scene. In an insult to the disabled, there is never much to her but her hellacious injury.","50","2053425"
"5617","There's a comic streak to the film that suggests David Fincher may understand the material as trash, but it's the kind of affectation that only reinforces, rather than dulls, its insults.","50","2267998"
"5618","Smashed touches on the awkward perversity that often comes from seemingly pure emotions and intentions, and turns a noticeable, if slightly analytical, eye toward the selfish hurt and narcissistic projections inflicted by the perceived moral hierarchy against recovering addicts.","50","2063781"
"5619","Well, it's better than ""The Phantom Menace.""","50","172495"
"5620","The story suffers from a distracting aura of self-importance. Vikander brings a remarkable tenderness to her character (who, in real life, left her husband's side much earlier) but Redmayne's sharp gaze and toothy smile make it virtually impossible to ignore the actorly feat on display.","50","810819"
"5621","Whether the source material or Hare's tinkering is to blame for the fact that the story keeps the viewer at arm's length, the end result is still the same: A film that's technically superb, yet still falls short of true greatness.","50","976051"
"5622","Hitchcock is a diverting but dramatically insipid account of how the Master of Suspense took his biggest gamble and delivered his greatest success with ""Psycho.""","50","975645"
"5623","Viswanathan, Newton, and Adlon generate a bit of chemistry throughout, but it's undermined by the fundamentally mechanistic nature of Brian and Jim Kehoe's screenplay, which ultimately forces these girls' experiences into neat little scenarios that are constructed every bit as didactically as a workplace training video.","50","2531344"
"5624","Grueling and bleak, but not unintelligent...although it's hardly groundbreaking just because everyone's face gets pulpy.","50","137523"
"5625","Crystal Skull isn't bad--there are a few dazzling sequences, and a couple of good performances--but the unprecedented blend of comedy and action that made the movies so much more fun than any other adventure series is mostly gone.","50","367882"
"5626","But the climax of ""Close Encounters"" was breathtaking and the climax of The Abyss is downright embarrassing; in the light of day, its payoff effect looks like a glazed ceramic what's-it your 11-year-old made in crafts class. It's criminal. [9 Aug 1989, Calendar, p.6-1]","50","96754"
"5627","Enjoyable and even exciting at the start, Dog Day Afternoon degenerates into frustration and tedium toward nightfall—an experience no less painful for the audience than for the actors.","50","72890"
"5628","It's tempting to accuse director and star Kevin Costner of taking the idea of vanity production to a new level in this frontier adventure based on a book by David Brin.","50","119925"
"5629","If you (or your kids) loved Toy Story, you'll like Toy Story 2 as well. Just don't expect any big surprises.","50","120363"
"5630","Marlon Brando is airily light and masterly as the veteran anti-apartheid barrister who takes the case even though he knows that he can't get anywhere with the rigged court. He saves the picture for the (short) time onscreen. But the director, Euzhan Palcy, seems lost; her work is heavy-handed, and the script (by Colin Welland and the director, from a novel by Andre Brink) is earnest and didactic.","50","97243"
"5631","The director, Neil Jordan, and his cinematographer, the great Philippe Rousselot, have given the movie an extraordinary seductive look, but Rice (who wrote the screenplay) doesn't provide enough narrative to keep the audience satisfied.","50","110148"
"5632","The King of Comedy is a royal disappointment. To be sure, Robert De Niro turns in another virtuoso performance for Martin Scorsese, just as in their four previous efforts. But once again – and even more so – they come up with a character that it’s hard to spend time with. Even worse, the characters – in fact, all the characters – stand for nothing.","50","85794"
"5633","Terrified of puppets? Enjoy being scared? Then you'll be half-satisfied with Dead Silence, a rote horror pantomime.","50","455760"
"5634","It seems like a slam-dunk pitch -- ""Pretty Woman"" with the genders reversed -- but there's one major problem: The whole hooker-fantasy bit is much more of a guy thing.","50","372532"
"5635","While Eye In The Sky is effective in building suspense and making a talk-y drama compelling, these techniques are in service to high-minded, heavy-handed filmmaking that buries troubling wartime questions in simplistic rhetoric.","50","2057392"
"5636","Dead men may tell no tales, but with Disney's latest Pirates sequel, I'm not convinced that living men can tell tales with any more intrigue.","50","1790809"
"5637","Hurt is so good at capturing the charming and chilling Ned that he almost makes up for the film's two primary weaknesses: Kasdan's inexperience and a message of significant unpleasantness. [28 Aug 1981, p.P17]","50","82089"
"5638","In essence, this one is the equivalent of the ""B"" movies that flourished during the original's era -- and it proves middling, and occasionally muddled, on almost every level.","50","472399"
"5639","The members of its young cast (Jennifer Connelly, Joaquin Phoenix, Liv Tyler) have all shown promise elsewhere, but don't really get to do much but look attractive and troubled here. They may be stars, but as long as they keep treading water in bland stuff like this, the world may never know.","50","119381"
"5640","It's also a double-barreled bummer. There's no excitement in the bank-robbing, no thrill of the chase, no emotion over justice served or thwarted. Depp's Dillinger is neither charming nor despicable, nor does he occupy that delicious gray area between the two. His spree unspools dispassionately, cold as a Colt .380.","50","1152836"
"5641","Howard might be a major actor. His DJay, though, is a major character in search of a major author.","50","410097"
"5642","Milos Forman's film is a series of incredible simulations that never quite cohere into a movie.","50","125664"
"5643","The virtuosity on display is also the director's, of course, and that, for better and for worse, is pretty much the point of Drive, the coolest movie around and therefore the latest proof that cool is never cool enough.","50","780504"
"5644","With its lightweight hero and its random spray of ''high-powered'' action, Broken Arrow is like an underpopulated version of The A-Team. It's not just John Woo who gets swallowed up by the impersonal mechanics of big-budget mayhem. It's the audience, which pays for a sleek, dark thriller and gets recycled pulp instead.","50","115759"
"5645","These days, when presidential bouquets are named Gennifer Flowers, and when we all know what Jack Kennedy did beneath the White House covers, this sort of Capra-corn, even in the guise of light comedy, just doesn't have the same taste. More salt, please, and hold the butter.","50","112346"
"5646","Pfister, who, like his mentor Nolan, adamantly continues to shoot on film (not digital), shows a sure hand at staging scenes, creating visuals and setting a tone -- if only all the diverse elements here fit comfortably under the same tent.","50","2209764"
"5647","The Darjeeling Limited isn't so bad as to offend those who love Wes Anderson too much, but it is not the triumph that his previous films have been.","50","838221"
"5648","Begins promisingly and entertains for a stretch because you think it's leading to something more than one of the movie year's flattest conclusions.","50","181852"
"5649","The Tony Scott version of Tarantino comes out vulgar; the graphic violence and profanity-laced posturing represent everything that the wannabes soon used to exhaust audiences. Nevertheless, True Romance contains so many unforgettable moments.","50","108399"
"5650","It's fun to see the regular gang on hand for new adventures, joined by fresh characters who add touches of novelty and spice. But the secrets in this chamber aren't all that amazing once you get a glimpse of them.","50","295297"
"5651","My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 is a veritable feast of low-hanging fruit. The laughs are obvious, we see them coming a mile away.","50","3760922"
"5652","Here is more ambiguity, in a film that needs less of it.","50","2291540"
"5653","There’s no doubt Phantom Thread will be forever lauded as a great fashion movie, but I don’t think it’s even a good one. Its view of how fashion is made feels desiccated and airless, as if beautiful clothes can come into being only under a dome of oppression and anxiety.","50","5776858"
"5654","Fright Night is really ""Fright Lite,"" a film promising more than it delivers, and even that delivery is so late in the game that you may want to arrive fashionably late and skip what passes for plot development and concentrate on Richard Edlund's special effects. [05 Aug 1985, p.B3]","50","89175"
"5655","In terms of quality, though, Argo is just so-so.","50","1024648"
"5656","Cronenberg has said that he made the film to find out why he was making it. You may watch it for the same reason.","50","115964"

"5658","There's not enough substance to support the sentiment of this longish comedy-drama.","50","86425"
"5659","Anna Kendrick and Sam Rockwell have often been the lone bright spot in otherwise dismal movies, and it takes their combined charm to redeem Mr. Right.","50","2091935"
"5660","The laughs are proportionate to the stakes, which are middle-of-the-road.","50","1499658"
"5661","This is a decidedly hit or miss deal which, despite the current outpouring of critical praise, is destined to rank among the Coen's least memorable achievements.","50","138524"
"5662","It’s fitting that the visual effects have advanced so dramatically since 2011, as it allows the series to suggest that its ape protagonists have evolved to an equivalent degree, and yet, “War’s” story is beneath their intelligence.","50","3450958"
"5663","Despicable Me cannot be faulted for lack of trying. If anything, it tries much too hard, stuffing great gobs of second-rate action, secondhand humor and warmed-over sentiment into every nook and cranny of its relentlessly busy 3-D frames.","50","1323594"
"5664","It’s too bad that Chastain’s heady, exquisitely subtle performance is dragged down by the laughably vehement male characters that seek to speak for her. You can’t keep a good woman down. But you can constantly talk over her, I guess.","50","4209788"
"5665","Screenwriters Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith may not have any original ideas, but they write some good lines and have a great actress to deliver them.","50","852713"
"5666","""Mark Felt,” despite bits of bureaucratic cloak-and-dagger intrigue and a commanding lead performance by Liam Neeson, is a film that pings off relevance more than it feels charged with it.","50","5175450"
"5667","The acting makes the difference, and in Jacket it rises above the needs of the material.","50","366627"
"5668","It is well acted bunk, led by Hugh Jackman's righteous raging as the father of a missing girl, abducting a suspect (Paul Dano) to pummel and scald a confession from him. If only solving the case and ending this movie sooner was that simple.","50","1392214"
"5669","By convoluting the various planes of experience, by overlapping and obscuring ostensible realities and ostensible dreams, Mr. Nolan deprives us the opportunity of investing emotionally in any of it.","50","1375666"
"5670","Intriguing but overly portentous drama, which seems far more taken with its own cynicism than most viewers will be.","50","1124035"
"5671","The end is a long time coming in Reindeer Games and the dialogue is mostly slush.","50","184858"
"5672","Turns out to be a more disappointment than joyful reunion, a tedious and desperately drawn-out affair that tests your patience even as it brazenly courts (and often earns) your contempt.","50","1000774"
"5673","Little Men doesn’t come to grips with much of anything, leaving relationships and questions of sexuality and even Leonor’s uncertain future uncertain.","50","4919484"
"5674","What emerges is a very poor man's North by Northwest without much moral nuance and a decreasing number of thrills.","50","119174"
"5675","By the time you've gotten through it, you feel spent, loaded down and more than a little disoriented. Part of the problem is that the movie's big concepts - violence begets violence, absolute power corrupts absolutely, everything is connected, my terrorist is your freedom fighter, etc. - are pithy, brief and irrefutable enough to embroider on throw pillows.","50","434409"
"5676","Singleton's plot is disappointingly conventional; it obeys screenwriting-class rules. The experience he's dealing with here deserves something more than the tidy dramatic structure that he has imposed on it.","50","101507"
"5677","Think of the worst Spielberg thriller or one of Hitchcock's dull late career works, then make it ugly and fill it with bad performances; voila: The Happening.","50","949731"
"5678","This mix of titillation and sentimentality can pass as family entertainment because 17 Again is so weightless, a succession of one-liners, sincere monologues and logical absurdities.","50","974661"
"5679","Boasting a few nifty action sequences and the always-compelling Jackman, Logan self-consciously aspires to retire this iteration of the steel-clawed hero with epic grandeur, and the results are often rousingly bleak. And yet, the risks taken...only make the formulaic redemption story and clichéd emotional underpinnings increasingly frustrating.","50","3315342"
"5680","White House Down is a corker, real competition for “Fast & Furious 6″ as the dumbest fun you’ll have at the movies this summer.","50","2334879"

"5686","If the bad guys didn't reappear with welcome regularity, ""Money Never Sleeps"" would be even more of a snooze than it already is.","50","1027718"
"5687","In the end, The Constant Gardener is hardly more than yet another study of white, upper-middle-class martyrdom rather than the hard look at third-world suffering it might've been.","50","387131"
"5688","Forget about social significance, depth of character and complex thematic underpinnings, and repeat after me: ""It's only a werewolf movie.""","50","118604"
"5689","For all its unwieldy temporal scope and narrowness of perspective, Nixon is an amazingly graceful beast, flawed yet invigorating, packed with enough material that will fascinate and irk moviegoers of all stripes for quite a time to come.","50","113987"
"5690","Between them, first-time screenwriter Carl Ellsworth and director Wes Craven don't come up with a single clever way to generate suspense, and the movie's onboard atmosphere is so phony.","50","421239"

"5693","Far from a disaster, but doesn't rank with Mann's best work.","50","430357"
"5694","Luc Besson is a masterly director of stylish, thrilling, and humorous action set pieces, and this film's bravura opening and closing sequences are two of the year's best.","50","110413"
"5695","Fogelman clearly gets a thrill in constructing a tapestry full of one random tragedy after another (seriously, almost nothing good seems to happen to these people long term). And he also appears to love manipulating the audience’s emotions with these subsequent tragedies.","50","5989218"
"5696","McKinnon dives head-first into every imbecilic scene, and Kunis stoically pretends to believe her BFF is sentient. But the movie around them is a wreck, and no amount of cloak-and-dagger will keep that secret for long.","50","6663582"
"5697","It's clever, in a ""dare you to name this hommage"" kind of way, but it's fundamentally heartless and coldly hollow.","50","243133"
"5698","Not that anyone was asking for a reboot of the series that is perhaps best remembered as the launching pad for Johnny Depp's career, but here it comes anyway. The film will probably gain several points on the likability scale for its sheer unexpectedness and modest ambitions.","50","1232829"
"5699","Martin Scorsese's keyed-up, irreverent tone frequently fails to distinguish itself from the grunting arias sung by the oily paragons of commerce his film evidently intended to deflate.","50","993846"

"5703","Nate Parker strains to control the strange and stirring complications of his subject's visionary apocalypticism.","50","4196450"
"5704","In Reitman’s hands — which are confident and clumsy in equal measure — these hefty matters play out as a mordant political comedy that tries to split the difference between “Veep” and “All the President’s Men.” That’s a tough needle to thread, and it doesn’t take long before “The Front Runner” throws in the towel on that idea.","50","7074886"
"5705","While the first half of The Rescuers Down Under is breathtakingly magnificent, the second half is slower than a sloth. [16 Nov 1990, p.7]","50","100477"
"5706","A reasonably watchable sci-fi B movie, a case of a good director and some intriguing ideas struggling to overcome formula plotting, limp dialogue, and a serious case of the sillies.","50","986263"
"5707","More like an attempt to reenergize a franchise than rebottle the lightning that electrified the original.","50","1409024"
"5708","The movie isn't as funny or entertaining as ""Evil Dead II,"" however, maybe because the comic approach seems recycled.","50","106308"
"5709","Like most movies in which a central story element doubles as a toy tie-in, Prince of Persia isn't overly burdened by ambition.","50","473075"
"5710","Obliged to launch the hero on an effective counterattack down the stretch, Wallace goes through the motions proficiently enough for exploitation thriller purposes. He should have quit while he was ahead, but Halloween III demonstrates a reasonable ability to control comic-horror effects on his first derivative try. [27 Oct 1982, p.D9]","50","85636"
"5711","Jordan would like us to believe that the three films are stages in a metamorphosis, but the stitching shows… Part Two, explored and expanded, might have made a good film, especially since Davidson gives a quiet, knowledgeable, perfectly poised performance. [14 Dec 1992]","50","104036"
"5712","The screenplay is so stale that even fans of the previous ""Jurassic"" installments might think this is one clone too many.","50","163025"
"5713","You could say the 3-D animated kidpic How To Train Your Dragon is ""Avatar"" for simpletons. But that title is already taken, by ""Avatar.""","50","892769"
"5714","Even as dystopian dramas go, the picture is arid and lusterless in its more serious moments and unpleasantly kitschy when it tries to soar over the top.","50","1706620"
"5715","Under the Skin can be confused for a movie that hides its meanings, when it's really a movie that hides its meaninglessness.","50","1441395"
"5716","Pablo Larraín's film bluntly hammers home the notion that history is framed by perception rather than reality.","50","1619029"
"5717","The action is carefully calculated to captivate a wide audience while allowing hard-core trekkies to savor nuances of plot and personality.","50","117731"
"5718","This schizophrenic conception of Gosling's character is indicative of the film's largely dichotomous view of romantic relationships.","50","1570728"
"5719","The movie is quite enjoyable as long as it explores the fantasy of a neglected little boy having an entire house of his own to explore and play in, but the physical cruelty that dominates the last act leaves a sour taste, and the multiple continuity errors strain one's suspension of disbelief to near the breaking point.","50","99785"
"5720","The script is fueled by genuine wit, everyone turns in fine performances and, beginning to end, the film actually shows some thought, if little originality.","50","106697"
"5721","It’s focused on pleasing fans of the original without taking any risks. It’s a pleasant, diverting, modestly ambitious film, fun for the whole family. But it leaves much to be desired, too.","50","5028340"
"5722","Ultimately, the best thing about (500) Days of Summer isn't its gimmicky script. It's the constant performance of Gordon-Levitt, who shifts, scene-by-scene, from moments of ebullience to abject dejection.","50","1022603"
"5723","Luckily, Penn, Watts and Leo carry more weight than that; they keep this movie's two hours and five minutes from seeming like lost time.","50","315733"
"5724","A full-immersion exercise in the old-fashioned women's weepie that skews far closer to Nicholas Sparks' brand of contrivance than Diablo Cody territory.","50","1967545"
"5725","Can't match an ounce of the suspense generated by contestants frantically buying airline tickets on Bruckheimer's own TV money quest, ""The Amazing Race."" This movie is a fortune wasted.","50","368891"
"5726","Despite strong acting (the slapstick energy between Ford and Connery is wasted), obligatory chases and stunts and splendid art direction, the virtuoso technique evident in every frame remains formulaic--unaccompanied by revelation, epiphany or surprise.","50","97576"
"5727","In Lost Highway, David Lynch dabbles in spooky, chilly implication and a sort of hip incoherence.","50","116922"
"5728","Only a teenage boy could find this kind of stuff continually diverting, and only a teenage boy would not notice flimsy emotions and underdeveloped acting. It seems George Lucas, like Peter Pan, has never really grown up.","50","121765"
"5729","Spartan is the same old stuff, but now it's been thoroughly Mametized, like a spray-on treatment you could spritz out of a can.","50","360009"
"5730","Speaking of Looney, I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention how violent this pre-tween farce is. Slapfights, brawls, violent death and near-death experiences abound. Along with butt-sniffing and toilet-sipping (at a party) gags.","50","2709768"
"5731","When I go to a Mummy movie, I don't want ninjas and yetis and men turned to stone. I want embalmed corpses and hieroglyphics. I want pharaoh. I want pyramids and sphinxes and Ace bandages. Did ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" take place on the Nile?","50","859163"
"5732","Ultimately, Fox’s stab at reviving one of its inherited Marvel properties feels less like a blockbuster for this age of comics-oriented tentpoles than it does another also-ran — not an embarrassment, but an experiment that didn’t gel.","50","1502712"
"5733","THE BLUES BROTHERS is a monument to waste, noise and misplaced cool, but it does have its engagingly nutty moments.","50","80455"
"5734","I entered the screening for The X-Files: Fight the Future with myriad questions... I left with disappointing answers. [19 June 1998, p. 7E]","50","120902"
"5735","It's precisely at the finish line that Simon's calculations misfire and The Goodbye Girl collapses like a house of cards. The movie could have told us something about the wrenching collision of careers and romance, but it plays it safe, and in the end pays for it. [05 Dec 1977, p.109]","50","76095"
"5736","The clever dialogue, seductive camera work, and beautiful production design (the lavish dream sequences look like Busby Berkeley on Ecstasy) almost make you forget the vacancy at the movie's core, but in the end there's no escaping the feeling that the Coens are speaking a secret language.","50","118715"
"5737","By this time in his life, Fischer (who was Jewish) was already into the anti-Semitic conspiracy theories that marred his public persona long after his days in the sports limelight had waned. While Zwick and company do nothing to explain this bizarre mania, Pawn Sacrifice definitely conjures the feeling of it, thanks in large part to the movie's greatest asset: Maguire's edgy, charismatic performance.","50","1596345"
"5738","The Peanut Butter Falcon may lack depth and subtlety, but you can always feel the beat of its heart.","50","4364194"
"5739","A disappointing domestic comedy in which all but the audience get what they want.","50","1606392"
"5740","Cronenberg can create alternative worlds like few other filmmakers, and that's a real achievement. If he learns to make us care about them, he'll really have something. [23 April 1999, Life, p.8E]","50","120907"
"5741","Aided by a strong soundtrack by Corbijn's friend Herbert Grönemeyer, The American nevertheless seems more like a concept in search of a movie.","50","1440728"
"5742","A film that turns the savagery of apartheid into a crisis of conscience for one relatively privileged white boy. Worse yet, it suggests that his crisis is a matter of urgent concern for countless South African blacks. [9 Oct 1992, p.11]","50","105159"
"5743","The Seventh Seal, assisted by cinematographer Gunnar Fischer’s richly overexposed images, operates as though it contains the undiluted essence of life’s fueling dialectic formula. Occasionally it does, most notably in the terrifying arrival of the self-flagellants to a weak-willed village. But the road-trippers in Bergman’s follow-up, Wild Strawberries, achieve a far greater grace and clarity with only a fraction of the heavy lifting.","50","50976"
"5744","Somewhat spastic and overcooked, Seven Psychopaths might have a few too many.","50","1931533"
"5745","Days of Thunder delivers only the bare essentials. Boys, the reasoning seems to go, will be lured into the theater by the siren call of gasoline and super-charged engines, while their girl friends will tag along to get a look at Cruise in tight jeans.","50","99371"
"5746","The noir atmosphere doesn't quite smother the dialogue's cheesy smell.","50","120611"
"5747","I, Robot strives to be so many things that it ultimately falls away to nothing, a heap of expensive metal parts.","50","343818"
"5748","Wright is one of the great character actors working these days, and losing track of him and his character hurts the film.","50","5057140"
"5749","There are flashes of subtle resentment to Williams’ performance that register as some of her best work in ages, so it’s unfortunate that the movie’s calculated assemblage of sentimental beats dominate the show.","50","7985692"
"5750","If they ever give Dolly her freedom and stop packaging her so antiseptically, she could be terrific. But Dolly and Burt and Whorehouse never get beyond the concept stage in this movie.","50","83642"
"5751","The material itself, thoroughly unsurprising on the stage, is if anything even more so on the screen.","50","88683"
"5752","Fred Walton, who directed Stranger, seems more skillful at orchestrating creepy atmospherics than John Carpenter was in Halloween. At the same time, he's scarcely clever or stylish enough to make Stranger a thriller worth going out of your way for. [20 Oct 1979, p.F6]","50","80130"
"5753","Crudely written, haphazardly acted, and improbably fun.","50","300556"
"5754","There's little of the seen-it-all, wise-guy acerbity that made his character in the X-Men trilogy stand apart from his fellow mutants. Here, he just glowers.","50","458525"
"5755","After a tense, terrific, stomach-turning opening that may have moviegoing acrophobes recalling Vertigo, the film soon becomes the latest screen variation on cat-and-Mighty Mouse. [28May1993 Pg.04.D]","50","106582"
"5756","This convoluted, time and continent-tripping tale is heavy on the adolescent angst and swoony romanticism.","50","144964"
"5757","Nearly everything good about Bad Words plays off the yin-and-yang dynamic between Guy and Chaitanya—one an endless wellspring of belligerence, the other grinning, excitable, and impossible to rattle.","50","2170299"
"5758","What Linklater does exceptionally well is open the door on an era seventeen years in the past. This is 1976, from the music and cars...to the people and their attitudes. You'd have to climb into a time machine to get a better view...However, this is light entertainment -- nothing groundbreaking or even especially noteworthy.","50","106677"
"5759","For as long as it forges ahead without explanations, The Unborn works, in its way, as a series of snap-cut gotchas introducing each new contestant in its pageant of cold-sweat set pieces.","50","1139668"
"5760","This vaguely likable, too-tame comedy falls short of the mark.","50","80487"
"5761","Paris, Texas is thus a curiosity. On balance it seems overblown and rickety, as substantial as tumbleweed. And it seems to be less than the sum of its two major parts, the script by Shepard and the images by Wenders. Still, it's an essential entry into the Wenders file, full of hollow portents and signs signifying little. And it would be worth seeing for Stanton's performance alone. [8 Feb 1985, p.8]","50","87884"
"5762","The only real heroes in this lumbering, over-inflated epic are the army of special effects coordinators and technicians who create a fantastic, otherworldly environment peopled by creatures more weird and threatening than Jabba The Hut. Freddie Francis' photography is constantly impressive. But technical wizardry alone cannot save Dune from a crash landing. [3 Jan 1985]","50","87182"
"5763","This is, indeed, a somewhat kinder, gentler Bad Boys: less proudly offensive, less extravagant, but still basically the same collection of stylish clichés made palatable by a duo of likable stars with good chemistry.","50","1502397"
"5764","Its ideal audience would be full of Three Stooges fans with streaks for grotesque humor. [13 Mar 1987, p.C18]","50","92991"
"5765","As effective as director Josie Rourke is at exposing the emotional and physical toll of reigning as queen when exploring Mary and Elizabeth's relationship, her portrait of an endless string of betrayals ends up as simply faceless and impersonal.","50","2328900"
"5766","It's sad to see two talented actresses, Rebecca de Mornay and Jennifer Jason Leigh, wasted in puppet parts. [17 June 1991, p.28]","50","101393"
"5767","It feels like three movies stitched together.","50","171580"
"5768","This is a visually claustrophobic, mechanically plotted movie that's meant to be a roguishly charming entertainment, and many people probably consider it just that.","50","70735"
"5769","Interesting to watch like well-performed gymnastics but it never really connects.","50","104348"
"5770","If the surpassingly murky narrative logic behind ""Generations"" is any indication of what's to come, Paramount had better start making explanatory material available to perplexed viewers as well as confused critics. [18 Nov. 1994, p.L27]","50","111280"
"5771","Predictable, slightly painful and as embarrassing as all get-out.","50","151738"
"5772","Verhoeven's film is fascinating, if stupid and stylish, if shallow. The story has to move along at a fair clip because otherwise we'd notice how nonsensical it all is. And there is very little to connect with emotionally.","50","103772"
"5773","The steady Costner gives a competent enough performance this time out as he dances with foxes, or at least one, while Grammy winner Houston is quite impressive in her feature debut, displaying both hot and cool emotion as well as performing six new songs...Unfortunately, she is assigned to handle lines like, ""You're a hard one to figure out, Frank Farmer,"" and ""I've never felt this safe before."" Unfortunately, too, the romance gets in the way of the thriller, and when the two principals finally take to their bed, so does the movie. [25 Nov 1992, p.C2]","50","103855"
"5774","Still, those who adore the two stars will find some fun here. And if you don’t “know the story,” you won’t be nearly as bored as the rest of us.","50","1976009"
"5775","It's by turns poignant and cold, twisted and sweet, dreamy and drab, effortless and overwrought. In short, the movie is a stunning, ambitious mess that leaves you wondering how much better it might have been without Kubrick's specter peering over Spielberg's heavy shoulders.","50","212720"
"5776","The character as written is incoherent, but Ms. Witherspoon has the reflexes to make Elle both appealing and ridiculous. It's funny -- in that slightly queasy, un-P.C. Doris Day kind of way.","50","250494"
"5777","Narrow definitions of femininity limit the comedy and the romance.","50","207201"
"5778","This is a rare case of a film that’s stronger when it colors inside the lines than radically traces outside of them.","50","8652728"
"5779","Partly because of Alda's comedy training on television, he hassucceeded in making, for two thirds of its length, an amusing and verycommercial film. But the last part shows him failing at what he reallywanted to do. [23 May 1981]","50","82405"
"5780","These characters don't seem illuminating at all – just damned annoying and, ultimately, dead boring.","50","757361"
"5781","As usual with Burton, the visuals are much better than the story, and Carroll’s characters are richly realized--especially Tweedledum and Tweedledee, poster children for juvenile obesity, and the raving Red Queen, played with razor-sharp timing by Helena Bonham Carter.","50","1014759"
"5782","The Prophecy suffers from an overall dreariness, a surprising lack of suspense and sloppy, rapid-fire editing. Despite Walken's alternately amusing and frightening performance, the low-budget movie becomes so tedious that, by the end, even a cameo by the Prince of Darkness fails to impress. [05 Sep 1995, p.5D]","50","114194"
"5783","A workmanlike sequel, it lacks the wit and intelligence of its predecessor.","50","65462"
"5784","Perhaps for Zwigoff, directing someone else's script, this was just a job of work. If not, the talent who made ""Crumb"" and ""Ghost World ""has now made his first movie mistake.","50","307987"
"5785","To start as a genre resuscitation and end up as simply generic — that’s a far more fatal ending than any curse befalling the characters onscreen.","50","3612126"
"5786","The picture throws off no feeling, not even the misanthropic kind; at best, it manages a dull, throbbing energy, as if Burton were dutifully pushing his way through the material instead of shaping it.","50","408236"
"5787","Squanders an appealing performance from Costner.","50","117918"
"5788","The drab script is by Albert Maltz and Malvin Wald; the film is visually impressive only.","50","40636"
"5789","Most fun when it's locked up with daddy.","50","124298"
"5790","Undeniably, the picture now and again supplies that edge-of-the-seat sensation; yet, by action-adventure standards, Speed is leaden and strangely poky. It never seems to shift into overdrive and let fly.","50","111257"
"5791","Coogler’s Creed interrogated the Rocky series, including the great-white-hope subtext of the originals, from the ground up, but Creed II just skims along the surface.","50","6343314"
"5792","The plot is just a delivery system for a series of gruesome, convoluted, and--depending on your tolerance for sadism--hilarious freak accidents.","50","309593"
"5793","As box-office packages go, My Girl may well become a big hit. The wrapping is colourful, even charming in spots, and that circle of black ribbon is a gravely clever touch. Get closer, though, and it's like those Christmas presents stacked around the department store tree - apparently real but really empty. [28 Nov 1991]","50","102492"
"5794","There are chuckles here and there, but a striking absence of belly laughs; Girls Trip it’s decidedly not.","50","2704998"
"5795","A modest and mildly pretentious mediocrity in the Woodman canon.","50","416320"
"5796","It’s the sort of poetic conceit that needs a filmmaker far more rapt and intuitive than Haynes, whose jeweler’s precision keeps everything at an emotional remove.","50","5208216"
"5797","Cruel, unfunny and yet somehow perversely fascinating.","50","1197628"
"5798","If you change the course of history, the world will experience a different kind of chaos. That's a time-honored movie cliche. Terminator 2: Judgment Day chooses to go against that philosophy, noisily and with some monotony.","50","103064"
"5799","Has its compelling moments, and its playfully inventive ones, too.","50","204626"
"5800","A 2½-hour art film that is something of a well-intentioned mess.","50","466893"
"5801","One night in 1408 stretches out until it ends up feeling more like a routine three-day business trip. The scariest thing in it may be the way the clock radio has a way of turning itself on, loudly, of its own accord. The song is always the Carpenters' ""We've Only Just Begun."" Now THAT'S horror.","50","450385"
"5802","Lacks even the good, guilty setup of ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" -- the sense that the heroes are fleeing the consequences of their own crime.","50","130018"
"5803","For a film that's ostensibly about modern American society's love affair with addictive behavior – sex, drugs, rock & roll – its bark is much worse than its bite.","50","427944"
"5804","Winslet is an actress, Diaz is not. The screenplay by Nancy Meyers, who directed, has dialogue that is not near the snap level of, say, Nicole Holofcener's comparable ""Friends With Money.""","50","457939"
"5805","The film's meticulousness orchestration only calls attention to its dubious sense of purpose, which lies beyond human subjectivity.","50","3808342"
"5806","But it IS a movie about dopes: goofy guys, born without the ambition gene, and who would not survive a minute in the drug world, or the real one, without the guardian angel of a scriptwriter hovering to think them out of scrapes.","50","910936"
"5807","The movie's initial intensity is so great, it consumes itself. By the time we reach the final scene, which is clearly supposed to exude glorious rapture between offbeat lovers Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern, it has all the warming effect of cold ash.","50","100935"
"5808","There are three fine performances lost in this otherwise middling film. Alan Arkin makes a wonderfully gruff newspaper editor who does just about as much barking as Marley. Jennifer Aniston makes the most of the rather slender figure of Jennifer Grogan, creating a believably human picture of a career woman who gives it up for the kids. And then there's the dog that plays Marley.","50","822832"
"5809","Wanted isn't quite the real Slim Shady of hip-hop comedies. But you might lose yourself in a few of its amusing moments.","50","328099"
"5810","Tender Mercies fails because of an apparent dimness of perception that frequently overcomes dramatists: they don't always know when they've got ahold of the wrong end of the story they want to tell. [29 Apr 1983, p.B1]","50","86423"
"5811","Heavy Metal is a first-class entertainment for the classof people whose eardrums are as strong as the pans of a steel band, whosenerves could be used to conduct electricity and whose fantasies tend tothe leathery: it is, in other words, a movie for horny, hell-raising teen-agers. [7 Aug 1981]","50","82509"
"5812","Alexander Payne’s science-fiction comedy Downsizing is less a fully formed satire than a clever idea stuck in first draft and stretched uncomfortably to feature length.","50","1389072"
"5813","Meticulous in its adherence to conventional narrative inducement, this biopic only offers a sanded-down and embossed vision of Stephen Hawking and Jane Wilde's 30-year marriage.","50","2980516"
"5814","Ultimately, the material is so familiar that it's hard to work up any enthusiasm for another trip though the seamy underside of glittering gaming life.","50","119256"
"5815","How well do Bond's established conventions survive after a third of a century's hard use, the post-cold war deglamourization of espionage and the arrival of yet another actor in the central role? The short answer is, on wobbly knees.","50","113189"
"5816","There's an easy familiarity and charm in the creased, middle-aged faces of Nimoy, Shatner and DeForest Kelly (the perpetually irascible Dr. McCoy), all of whom now play their parts with an ever-present twinkle. Their behavior rarely has anything to do with the motives provided by the plot; rather, they wear their characters like old habits, as they boldly go where they've always gone before. [26 Nov. 1986, p.C5]","50","92007"
"5817","The main interest here is the acting, which is, by turns, entertaining or just entertainingly bad, with lots of grungy seriousness and Method-trained twitching, but also some moments of real gusto.","50","335563"
"5818","Singer's approach to X2 is very much of the ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"" school, resulting in a movie that, even at its best -- a thrilling jailbreak scene that's the closest thing in either X movie to a rousing set piece -- seems tame and unmemorable.","50","290334"
"5819","My Name Is Bruce can be read as a man coming to terms with the career that he has been dealt, or it can be read as simply a trashy B-movie directed by the man who knows best.","50","489235"
"5820","With the exception of its bland leads, Back In Action's frenetic plot serves as its biggest weakness, but it at least provides the framework for two Tashlin-worthy setpieces.","50","318155"
"5821","Fighting With My Family reminds us several times that the sport is as much about charismatic storytelling as it is about skill. Judged by that standard, the film is far from belt-worthy.","50","6513120"
"5822","The more real Friday gets, the better it is. [26 Apr 1995]","50","113118"
"5823","Kubrick suppresses most of the active elements that make movies pleasurable. The film says that people are disgusting but things are lovely. And a narrator (Michael Hordern) tells you what's going to happen before you see it.","50","72684"
"5824","It doesn't play like reality, but like boilerplate filmic fantasy, and its novel setting and inception struggles seem positioned as a beard--or veil, if you will--to mask its mediocrity.","50","2258858"
"5825","A crudely made, half-clever little frightener that has become something of a pop-culture sensation and most certainly the movie marketing story of the year.","50","1179904"
"5826","The parts are better than the whole. [24 Feb 1975, p.58]","50","73692"
"5827","It's not bad, as apes and 20th Century-Fox go, at least hand in hand.","50","68408"
"5828","Everything falls into place, click click click. Like many a formulaic piece, this one engages a real theme--here it's the conflict between the concept of duty and the idea of the individual--and does little with it. [25 Jan 1993]","50","104257"
"5829","Dumas' perennial story demands stars of stature or wit - components missing from this candy-bar wrapper of a movie. [12 Nov 1993, p.4D]","50","108333"
"5830","The director, Michael Mann, remembers the best of film noir pretty well, but it doesn't protect his film against its ultimate Movieland silliness.","50","369339"
"5831","Gets more and more complex until it's almost laughable; it has too many beats, too many reverses, and in the end seems unbelievable.","50","373926"
"5832","Clearly, an effort was made to create a serious, thoughtful movie.","50","119177"
"5833","But it is precisely with these contrapuntal strands of huge, timeless nature, of the complexity of every human mind, that Malick bloats his film into banality. [Jan. 25, 1999]","50","120863"
"5834","Director Joel Schumacher, whose pastel color schemes vitalized St. Elmo's Fire, gives this a sensual, at times even erotic, sheen. And a few subplot issues - single motherhood, runaway kids, midlife dating - hint that at least someone involved with this project intended to go after bigger game. [31 Jul 1987, p.4D]","50","93437"
"5835","What they give us in Goldfinger is an excess of science-fiction fun, a mess of mechanical melodrama, and a minimum of bedroom farce...It is good fun, all right, fast and furious, racing hither and yon about the world as Double-Oh Seven pursues the intrigues of a mysterious financier named Goldfinger.","50","58150"
"5836","""Less"" has trouble framing simple action, yielding clumsy car chases that put the burden of generating excitement on the music and editing. As a result, pic looks cheap and feels clipped.","50","1622547"
"5837","None of its core characters, including the female protagonist (played by Florence Pugh, “Fighting With My Family”), make any rational decisions (while being too distant to care about anyway).","50","8772262"
"5838","What the movie is all about is Twin Peaks with the sex, violence and ""colorful"" language left in...Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me is not David Lynch at his most challenged and hence most inventive. The rigid restraints of television, with its prudish codes and goofy winks at prurient-life-as-we-know-it, may now be seen as Lynch's real muse. The movie, lurid as it is, reads like a perverse set of CliffNotes to the series, the details recapitulated explicitly but without a dram of passion. [2 Sept 1992, p.E1]","50","105665"
"5839","A corny, overblown romance, and while it eventually wins you over with its atmosphere and good nature, it's far from the masterpiece you've been hearing about. [15 Jan 1988]","50","93565"
"5840","While far too much of the film is staged discussion and smug political jousting, there is savage and lethal black irony.","50","93058"
"5841","While Passengers offers a few shrewd observations about our increasingly tech-enabled, corporatized lives, its heavy-handed mix of life-or-death exigencies and feel-good bromides finally feels like a case of more being less.","50","1355644"
"5842","For most of the way, Return to Sender merges creepy and sexy to good effect, thanks to a close-to-the-vest performance by Rosamund Pike.","50","2948790"
"5843","They have created a strange document about the unmaking of young lives, but it is a movie made without comment. Clark has stepped back into objectivity so far that he has neglected his role as interpreter for us.","50","113540"
"5844","Day of the Dead is an unsatisfying part three in George A. Romero's zombie saga. The acting here is generally unimpressive and in the case of Sarah's romantic partner, Miguel (Antonio DiLeo, Jr.), unintentionally risible.","50","88993"
"5845","The film is shot by Bill Pope with such enterprising flair that it never looks claustrophobic, but the action inevitably stalls in such close quarters.","50","115736"
"5846","Nicholson's over-the-top acting gives an entertaining edge to the plot's feel-good manipulations.","50","119822"
"5847","Meyers has a good feel for contemporary comedy; it’s reality, however, that slips through her grasp.","50","1230414"
"5848","You won't see the twist coming, thanks to a clever and precise piece of casting, but that's the best compliment that can be paid to Awake, a plotty and unfocused medical thriller.","50","211933"
"5849","Clearly designed as a cult film, this messy trifle is not without its charms. These include the affably weird Goldblum, Lithgow's deliriously overstated mad scientist, and a band of alien invaders who are not emissaries of a vastly superior race, but beer-swilling mediocrities in Hawaiian shirts.","50","86856"
"5850","Better than any automobile flick put out by Hollywood in a while and, thanks to some genuinely exciting moments, it is easily the most entertaining so far of this summer's big, brainless action movies.","50","232500"
"5851","Beautifully shot but a soulless cash machine, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 delivers no dramatic payoff, no resolution and not much fun. Hopefully we'll get that in the final installment next summer.","50","926084"
"5852","It looks and feels less like a film and more like a feature-length pilot for a new TV series which happens to have a stacked cast.","50","4540710"
"5853","Cute, bordering on cutesy, yes. Light and shallow and inconsequential in a lot of ways. But funny? Rarely.","50","804497"
"5854","It's not a winner and not quite a loser either. Like many a beauty contestant, it's glib instead of serious, stylish instead of substantial. Miss Universe, it could never be. Homecoming queen, maybe.","50","157503"
"5855","You have to be willing to take a lot of punishment for a few good scares.","50","492044"
"5856","This handsomely photographed, briskly directed sci-fi fright picture is enjoyable enough on its own limited terms.","50","134847"
"5857","Acutely observed but gloomy and lacking narrative, it tells of 12 months in the life of a decent but dull suburban couple and their friends, most of whom you would go out of your way to avoid at a party.","50","1431181"
"5858","A road movie short on comedy and drama should at least offer a keen level of observation, but here insight is scarce and emotional resonance is faint.","50","3741632"
"5859","Eckhart, who gets more rugged by the picture, certainly works hard to bring the audience along. But he's a nervous wreck for nothing. This movie isn't talking to us, it's talking to other serial killer movies.","50","324127"
"5860","All told, though, Thor suffers from ""Iron Man 2"" syndrome: too much backstory, too many subplots and character introductions, and not nearly enough full-frontal nudity from Natalie Portman, who frankly is given very little to work with here.","50","800369"
"5861","You'll figure out just about everything that's going to happen in Cool Runnings, a congenial Disney comedy, quicker than an icicle melts in Kingston. [4 Oct 1993, p.4D]","50","106611"
"5862","The story, such as it is, follows Renton's inconsistent attempts to kick his habit.","50","117951"
"5863","Humor is notoriously subjective, of course, but I didn't find Young Adult especially funny. It's an intermittently engaging fable of American homecoming that's both intentionally and unintentionally awkward, and flavored from bitter to sour all the way through.","50","1625346"
"5864","The movie is simply a failure of imagination. Nobody looked at the screenplay and observed that it didn’t try hard enough, that it had no surprises, that it didn’t attempt to delight its audiences with twists and turns on the phoned-in plotline.","50","94631"
"5865","Like its predecessor, All Saints Day will, if nothing else, be a cult item for Roman Catholic schoolboys; the next sequel, blatantly set up, should arrive no later than 2019.","50","1300851"
"5866","The semifunny Semi-Pro is amiable enough, but you never feel there's much at stake.","50","839980"
"5867","I don’t get the enthusiasm for this movie, written and directed by Damien Chazelle, which is such a cooked-up piece of claptrap that I half expected Darth Vader to pick up the baton. We’re supposed to think that Terence’s tough love is more “honest” than the usual pussyfooting tutelage, but in any sane society this guy would have been brought up on charges long ago.","50","2582802"
"5868","An idealized, dreamy fantasy of life in the business world-harmless as airplane reading, a bit dull on the big screen. [2 Mar 1990, Friday, p.C]","50","99810"
"5869","Like ""The Addams Family"" before it, this is one of those clever, lively and ultimately wearying pieces of showy Hollywood machinery where a glut of creativity has gone into the visuals with only scraps left over for the plot and the dialogue. [27 May 1994 Pg.F1]","50","109813"
"5870","The Master is Paul Thomas Anderson with the edges sanded off, the best bits shorn down to nubs.","50","1560747"
"5871","Make no mistake -- this Mummy is an effects film all the way.","50","120616"
"5872","Mike Werb's screenplay -- just a rickety framework for Carrey's consummate clowning -- lacks a propelling plot and has zip in terms of secondary character development.","50","110475"
"5873","Starts off promisingly, but gets bogged down when it abandons humor for gravity.","50","448157"
"5874","Since this isn't one of your deep-think sci-fi movies, you look for the happy hardware to get you kicks. [4 July 1976, p.102]","50","74812"
"5875","We get a fairly typical Hollywood flattening of history, with powerful villains and disenfranchised heroes.","50","1454029"
"5876","Future II bombards you with more brand-name advertising than three hours of prime-time TV could muster, although repeat filmmakers Bob Gale and Robert Zemeckis put a humorous twist on everything.","50","96874"
"5877","Much of the acting is solid, but earnest performances can't give the picture all the bite and excitement it sorely needs.","50","120603"
"5878","Director Madden vacillates between treating the issues and historical context of The Debt seriously, and as the story demands, as pure, heavy-handed pulp.The cast does what it can in the service of this assignment. But some jobs simply resist satisfying completion.","50","1226753"
"5879","This movie reverie has an almost laughable '80s tone - a yuppified style and even language - that practically buries Costner. [21 Apr 1989, Daily Datebook, p.E1]","50","97351"
"5880","Feels cramped and underimagined. I think Judge is capable of making an inspired live-action comedy, but next time he'll have to remember to do what he does in his animated ones--keep the madness popping.","50","151804"
"5881","Aside from the thrill of its lavish sets and costumes, there isn’t much new to offer in this Beauty and the Beast.","50","2771200"
"5882","Based on the popular television series, Twilight Zone--The Movie is a frightfully lopsided omnibus that begins with two wretched episodes by John Landis and Steven Spielberg and finishes with an engrossing pair by Joe Dante and George Miller.","50","86491"
"5883","There is barely a graceless frame in the whole affair.","50","5592248"
"5884","Even at its worst moments, it's better than ""awful."" But at its best, it's never comes close to ""incredible.""","50","1212436"
"5885","Alien 3 is pretentious and gimmicky by turns, resorting at times to silly B-movie tricks that undercut its seriousness and moments that can be anticipated from a mile off. [22 May 1992, P.D1]","50","103644"
"5886","The movie seems destined to win a place in the nocturnal-cityscape-hell hall of fame. Its externals are brilliant, but The Hudsucker Proxy is virtually nothing but externals. [25 Mar 1994, p.52]","50","110074"
"5887","Despite the rich associations, the film finally makes little more of its central figure, a hideously deformed young man, than an object of pity.","50","80678"
"5888","Almost every scene is excruciating (and a few are appalling), yet the film stirs an obscene fascination with its rapid, speed-freak cutting and passionate psychological striptease. This is the feverish, painful expression of a man who lives in mortal fear of his own mediocrity.","50","78754"
"5889","A mild comedy of embarrassment.","50","1477837"
"5890","After four Pixar features under their belts, it is painfully easy to see the clichés emerging.","50","266543"
"5891","The movie is like one thin satiric lark inexplicably slowed down to the point of lethargy.","50","1602613"
"5892","Think of it as a kind of “Twilight Zone 2007” in which the paranoia endemic to an industry that runs on illusion, hype and extravagant grandiosity comes home to roost.","50","810988"
"5893","Lofty ideas of class, thwarted ambition, the superficiality of L.A. life, the nature of love, and the meaning of art are all explicitly addressed – and maybe discussed in a pretentious conversation or two – and then just as easily dropped, as if the simple act of naming themes is enough to establish their continued relevance in the film.","50","4550098"
"5894","I like my God, though, like I like my comedies: ruder, cruder, and able to show me things I haven't seen before. Bruce Almighty is sadly miracle-free.","50","315327"
"5895","Kids will enjoy the wisecracks and foolishness, and the big musical production numbers are toe-tappers -- or would be if the veggies had feet.","50","298388"
"5896","The Muppets are a wonderful creation, but they lose their special quality in ""The Great Muppet Caper."" They behave like clones of other popular kiddie superstars -- like the basic cartoon heroes they once seemed destined to replace.","50","82474"
"5897","Fortunately for Davis, he’s got a terrific cast, chief among them the pair of charismatic actors who split the lead role.","50","3741834"
"5898","This huge, unwieldy movie is busy and overcrowded.","50","2975590"
"5899","The movie isn't skillful enough to back up its satiric presumptions. Though it obviously aims to be sassy and uninhibited, Airplane! never approaches the comic heights achieved unwittingly by ""Airport '75"" and the peerless ""Concorde -- Airport 1979."" [3 July 1980, p.C11]","50","80339"
"5900","Think ""Cruel Intentions"" in period costume, or better yet, Sofia Coppola's ""Marie Antoinette,"" which managed to take its subject matter lightly and seriously at the same time.","50","467200"
"5901","All Fey does is apply a smattering of wit to the story.","50","377092"
"5902","A courtroom thriller that becomes sillier and more generic as it zips along. It moves fast (a rare quality for a contemporary thriller), but doesn’t end up going anywhere interesting.","50","2304953"
"5903","Disclosure is pure and simple trash masquerading as significance. [9 Dec 1994, p.B]","50","109635"
"5904","It just doesn't add up to anything -- or break down -- to anything special. For good or bad, there's hardly a memorable scene in it.","50","120791"
"5905","The Graduate is not subtle in its writing off of the parental generation as hopelessly corrupt. [Review of re-release]","50","61722"
"5906","There's nothing much new going on here (we feel compelled to point out the resemblance to one of the worst-ever episodes of The X-Files, ""Teso Los Bichos""), but it's all slickly done, with the requisite big jumps, false leads, weird science and scary trips down dark corridors.","50","120004"
"5907","[A] bafflingly unbalanced film by American auteur director Alex Ross Perry.","50","7942742"
"5908","A lumpy stew of weak characterization, lame gags, ADD-afflicted storytelling, and dazzling visual.","50","844471"
"5909","All that suspense falls dead at its climax, which proves to be a bore. The absence of a surprise ending and the lackluster spooks make this one worth skipping. I'm going back to see ""The Sixth Sense.""","50","164181"
"5910","Director Rodrigo Cortes intends us to feel trapped, twitchy and unhappy and at the same time, wildly grateful we're not actually in the box like Paul. I could do without that kind of guilt trip from a film.","50","1462758"
"5911","Lovely to look at, and Vikander does nothing to derail her inevitable ascension to the A-list. But as a story, it evokes a word that no battlefield nurse would ever apply to her experiences: sterile.","50","1441953"
"5912","David Lowery has a carefree, bordering on insubstantial touch, which gives rise to several rank absurdities.","50","2837574"
"5913","It's not much, but adult audiences starved for mature entertainment should be counted on to investigate this flawed, if admittedly heartfelt, work.","50","1045658"
"5914","The question is not whether Murphy can do anything. He can. The question is why he would want to make a movie as squirmingly unfunny as Norbit.","50","477051"
"5915","It’s so respectful that vibrancy suffers. Coco is a bright pinata of a movie that breaks and nothing falls out.","50","2380307"
"5916","It helps that Myers has Powers down pat. Still, the need to parody ""Casino Royale"" could have been taken care of in an eight-minute TV skit; instead, we're given nearly 90 minutes of someone else's party.","50","118655"
"5917","The movie is of minimum interest; the story of the movie, however -- or, rather, of the way in which it has been engulfed by its own publicity -- is bound to fascinate connoisseurs of cultural meltdown.","50","120685"
"5918","This movie offers very few insights, and has no apparent point beyond mythologizing the early days of a company that doesn’t exactly need assistance in the self-mythologizing department.","50","4276820"
"5919","Krull is only half bad, which makes it half good, which puts it a broadsword ahead of most films set in the land of the mightily mythic. [30 July 1983]","50","85811"
"5920","Aficionados of gore and guts may not mind the comfortably lived-in feel of this blood-spattered Green Room. But anyone looking for the ferocious originality, and unexpected humanity, of “Blue Ruin” will be disappointed by Saulnier’s uninspired cover version of a song we all know.","50","4062536"
"5921","The makers of “Wonder Boys,” Douglas’s finest hour, did more to maintain their distance, and their patience, and Solitary Man feels a touch small and sour by comparison. That said, its litany of character studies is more engaging than most of what you will see this summer.","50","1294213"
"5922","George, director of ""Hotel Rwanda,"" is better at directing actors than visual storytelling. Every time the camera tilted to suggest a character's shaken world or distorted worldview I didn't feel heartache, I felt headache.","50","831884"
"5923","Burning Annie has funny moments, but it suffers from an overflow of characters.","50","307879"
"5924","Storytelling problems surface toward the overwrought climax, but the worst problem is the unrelenting grimness. It's hard to like a movie that leaves you with no hope.","50","452623"
"5925","Lester doesn't have the sense of visual style that other directors, like Spielberg and Lucas, bring to their comic-book movies; harshly lit and sometimes amateurish, Commando doesn't last in your eye. And Lester doesn't pace his sequences, allowing the suspense to build -- it's all breakneck, and it tires you out. [04 Oct 1985, p.E3]","50","88944"

"5929","A stylish but distressingly generic and not particularly scary American remake of a phenomenally popular Japanese supernatural thriller that spawned two sequels and a TV miniseries.","50","298130"
"5930","Fuzzy-headed biopic, which glosses over the former British prime minister's politics in favor of a glib, breakneck whirl around her career and marriage.","50","1007029"
"5931","Long segments of The Killer are devoted to people getting blown away, the bloodbaths played out always with guns. But the highly choreographed action, featuring point-blank shots of writhing victims, takes on a numbing aspect after a while. Reduced to cartoon overkill, it becomes as tedious in its way as carpenters working with nail guns.","50","97202"
"5932","When the action sequences move into the sky-diving stuff, they give you a real rush.... Otherwise, though, Point Break is all wet. Too bad, because you always get the sense in a Kathryn Bigelow outing (""Near Dark,"" ""Blue Steel"") that she's trying to push a genre into new places. [12 July 1991, p.54]","50","102685"
"5933","By the time the film escalates into a suitably ridiculous Grand Guignol finale, all connection to reality has been severed.","50","340163"
"5934","Despite the great care and research that went into the movie, Frost/Nixon pales in comparison to Oliver Stone's ""Nixon"" when it comes to humanizing the infamous leader.","50","870111"
"5935","It preserves the peculiar machismo of Ayer's earlier projects: the alpha male dominates not only because he's the most powerful, but because he's the most jaded.","50","421073"
"5936","The countdown-to-Armageddon structure generates almost no tension, but Olympus Has Fallen does have lots of squalidly bloody hand-to-hand action, all of which is so pulpy and standardthat the film actually makes you grateful for the presence of Gerard Butler, gnashing his teeth in the Bruce Willis role.","50","2302755"
"5937","Not everything from Ireland travels as well as the whiskey. Like mud-thick porridge, Shadow Dancer, another dreary, confusing conspiracy thriller about the Irish “troubles,” is one of them.","50","1770734"
"5938","Movies made from serious novels are often ridiculed as unworthy of their sources, but this one may be too worthy -- too reverent, too showy, too earnest.","50","120834"

"5940","Visually impressive but exceedingly unpleasant little nail-biter.","50","209958"
"5941","A big warm cinematic jelly doughnut stuffed with youth, vitality, style, whimsy and other equally alarming properties. I tried to love it. But after 20 minutes, I sensed I was intruding on the movie's love affair with itself.","50","446029"
"5942","The portmanteau horror movie makes a hesitant comeback with this jokey teen splatter pic.","50","96426"
"5943","What Fast Times at Ridgemont High has is an attractive, personable cast, a bunch of young actors who are very easy to like. What it doesn't have is a clear point of view, something that would make it of more interest than leafing through a high school yearbook. Its final sequence, for instance, could just as easily come in the middle of the movie for all the relation it bears to what goes on before.","50","83929"
"5944","Clint Eastwood resurrects the star system, the Hollywood love story, and middle-aged romance, but despite all his craft and sincerity, he and screenwriter Richard LaGravenese can't quite turn Robert James Waller's cardboard best-seller into flesh and bone.","50","112579"

"5951","Looper felt to me like a maddening near-miss: It posits an impossible but fascinating-to-imagine relationship...and then throws away nearly all the dramatic potential that relationship offers. If someone remakes Looper as the movie it could have been in, say, 30 years, will someone from the future please FedEx it back to me?","50","1276104"

"5953","An uneven but surprising movie, often outrageously funny and just as often completely flat.","50","1226229"
"5954","There are guilty pleasures to be had in this frenzied B starring Zoe Saldana (Avatar, Star Trek), who gives an acrobatic performance that makes the overcooked material watchable, if not entirely enjoyable.","50","1657507"
"5955","So much luck is pressed with an absurdly overblown finale that 60 seconds will likely be Swordfish's shelf life after a couple of noisy opening weekends.","50","244244"
"5956","The script is a tidy work of carpentry, in several time planes and with a tart finish. Tense moments abound, fights and shootings and near-drownings, but they seem items drawn from casework files. [5 Aug 1996, p.26]","50","116905"
"5957","There’s nothing surprising about this late ’60s tale, including its connection to the modern ghost stories told in “The Amityville Horror” and “The Conjuring.” But what it lacks in originality it makes up with in hair-raising execution. You will scream like a teenage girl.","50","3322940"
"5958","But while this terrific cast gets to strut and preen, it's difficult to make an emotional connection with most of them.","50","175880"

"5960","For all its surface seriousness, Splice is a regulation monster movie. So however somber it gets, it's never truly thought-provoking, and however outrageous it gets, it's still always 20 minutes behind the audience. It's just too dumb to be serious and too slow to be entertaining. Read more: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/06/03/MVKJ1DOO26.DTL#ixzz0pqYvhKuF","50","1017460"

"5963","While the new film is certainly serviceable, it's noticeably lacking in warmth and humor, and though its visual strengths are real and considerable, from a dramatic point of view it's ponderous and plodding.","50","120915"
"5964","A 2 1/2-hour movie with halves that don't quite mesh, it still gives Al Pacino a role that's a perfect fit. [23 Dec 1992 Pg. 01.D]","50","105323"
"5965","The movie has plenty of high-tech power, spinning out action so explosive you'll hardly notice how preposterous the story is or how cardboard-thin the characters are.","50","120660"
"5966","The drama and intensity that are [Haggis's] signatures are mostly missing from these vividly dramatized but uninvolving romantic crises, none of which are particularly believable.","50","2343793"
"5967","At this point in her career, Lopez can clearly bend the universe -- but no amount of bending can make Enough anything more than formulaic.","50","278435"
"5968","The Karate Kid is too long and lyrical, with several tedious scenes between Macchio and Morita as youth and experience. Avildsen is sometimes unsure whether he wants to be tough or forgiving, and the film has a big build-up for the fight scene, but an ending so abrupt it downplays the outcome. [22 June 1984]","50","87538"
"5969","Entertaining if you understand exactly what it is: if you see it as a film made by friends out of the materials presented by their lives and with the freedom to not push too hard.","50","115734"
"5970","To enjoy it, however, you have to do the mental equivalent of squinting your eyes, so the credibility is only fuzzily ridiculous.","50","119395"
"5971","Despite game efforts from a first-rate cast and acres of impressive production values, Event Horizon remains a muddled and curiously uninvolving sci-fi horror show.","50","119081"
"5972","Bad as the overall design remains, individual scenes keep sparking alive, partly because the dialogue, or delivery, seems fresh, and improvisatory; partly because Van Peebles, in his directorial debut, figures out unusual or athletic camera designs for every scene. It's obvious he has talent, equally obvious there's no way this story can work right, no matter how strenuous the staging.","50","102526"
"5973","The characters are funny and the cast's characterizations right on, but the movie repeatedly lets them down.","50","132347"
"5974","True to series form, plot is nearly indiscernible, but this fourth installment in the sci-fi/horror/action franchise created by writer-director Paul W.S. Anderson is the sleekest so far, thanks to 3D and star Milla Jovovich's body-hugging catsuit.","50","1220634"
"5975","Still, somewhat shame-faced I have to admit that at some point in the film I began to hear a subversive voice whispering in my ear, and what it was saying was, ""Could you blink a little faster, pal?""","50","401383"
"5976","If you're going to get on the wavelength of Little Miss Sunshine, you've got to be able to enjoy a comedy in which the characters fit into hermetically cute, predetermined sitcom slots.","50","449059"
"5977","(Duffy's) assembled a fine cast -- it's hard to take your eyes off the two young leads -- but he's given them little to do but squeeze triggers and mouth platitudes.","50","144117"
"5978","As always with Stone, the film has some gritty performances and a certain likable audacity.","50","146838"
"5979","Sam Peckinpah directed in imitation of Sam Peckinpah; it's a mechanical job, embellished with a vivacious, erotic subplot involving Al Lettieri and Sally Struthers.","50","68638"
"5980","The appeal is there for those who crave formulaic romantic drama, but there's little of interest for a wider audience.","50","989757"
"5981","The new film is a toss-up with George Pal's very watchable 1953 version: the special effects are even better here, the drama even lamer.","50","407304"
"5982","Withnail and I is one of those pictures that manages to be consistently amusing and grating at the same time. It stirs some good memories while pointing to the aimlessness of an era. [2 Oct 1987, p.5D]","50","94336"
"5983","Shot with head-mounted GoPro cameras, the Russian-made action flick Hardcore Henry mimics the experience of watching someone else play a very derivative first-person shooter with sub-Duke Nukem humor.","50","3072482"
"5984","A pretty good caper comedy for 11-year-old boys -- ""heist thriller"" would make it sound too ambitious.","50","240772"

"5986","Even though William Safire doesn't fit in the target demographic, Stick It is more valuable as a survey of modern American teen argot than as a movie.","50","430634"
"5987","For about half of its running time, Hellraiser: Bloodline is watchable. In fact -- let's throw around the superlatives -- it's mildly entertaining. [9 March 1996, p.B3]","50","116514"
"5988","Cowriter and director Dee Rees (Pariah, Bessie) does a skillful job making us feel these inequities as they take place over time and become the fabric of lives, the basis of the assumptions people make about race and culture — the way things are.","50","2396589"
"5989","It's not rocket science making nonstop action feel semi-fresh, and The Losers’ script by Peter Berg and James Vanderbilt manages to render each individual, um, a loser in the broadest and most memorable strokes. It's not a masterpiece, either, but it'll do until Hannibal, Murdock, and the rest the A-gamers start blowing things up come June.","50","480255"
"5990","Clooney and company work it too hard this time. You can tell they're huffing and puffing to stay afloat. But all I hear is: glug glug glug.","50","349903"
"5991","There are forces here you couldn't possibly comprehend...You can say that again.","50","146675"
"5992","Yet the McCarthy/Murrow conflict in the picture is not pressing enough--these days, anyway--to justify the considerable skill expended on it.","50","433383"
"5993","Terrified of alienating those who were raised on the originals, The Muppets panders to them instead, constantly blasting or restaging Top 40 hits from the past three-plus decades, continuing the cheap strategy that worked well on YouTube two years ago with the Muppets' cover of ""Bohemian Rhapsody.""","50","1204342"
"5994","The film transcends the déjà vu of its borrowed trappings but ironically sacrifices all momentum in favor of a long series of physical tests.","50","1840309"
"5995","Unfortunately, after a relatively promising warmup, pic actually proceeds to flatten out the characters in the latter sections and to make them less dimensional and interesting than they initially seemed.","50","108330"
"5996","Lee loads up his movie with so many hot buttons that the film resembles a compendium of all his previous provocations.","50","215545"
"5997","Emmerich succeeds only in making his previous venture, the marginal Stargate, look positively inspired by comparison.","50","116629"
"5998","As pointless suspense exercises go, The Strangers at least gets off to a good start.","50","482606"
"5999","Hill attempted to stylize gangster characters and conventions, and although he succeeded in the action sequences, which have a near-abstract visual power, the stylized characters, with their uninflected personalities, flatten the movie out.","50","77474"
"6000","Beaches is the never-less-than-maudlin soap opera about two childhood pen pals who meet again as adults, enjoy triumphs and endure failures, and wind up watching their story climax via a Fatal Illness straight out of Terms of Endearment. It's what used to be called a ""women's picture."" [13 Jan 1989, p.C5]","50","94715"
"6001","Stuart and Margolo are genuine marvels of computer generated special effects, each feather, whisker and strand of fur beautifully rendered. But they're bland and rather boring characters, dumbed down for kids.","50","243585"
"6002","I think Bloch and Rosenberg should get organized and take on the cabbage. If nothing else, a horror movie about cabbages could help Rosenberg work through his obsession and save a lot of analyst's fees.","50","68230"
"6003","Rosenthal observes all the ritual elements -- a veteran of the series, he seems to understand that its fans crave certainty over shock.","50","220506"
"6004","Capernaum is a movie that wants its audience to empathize with its protagonist so intensely that you agree he should never have been born. It’s a fascinating (if obviously counterintuitive) approach, but one that’s frustrated by the literalness with which Labaki unpacks it.","50","8267604"
"6005","The three actors manage to get a lot of mileage out of the material: although one never quite believes that Tandy's character is Jewish, she is remarkable in every other respect, and Freeman and Aykroyd are wonderful throughout.","50","97239"
"6006","It's not a disaster: Branagh is an actor's director, and there are biting moments throughout and solid performances from Caine and Law.","50","857265"
"6007","To call The Crazies the most original horror film in a long while only serves to point out just how lousy mainstream, studio-released horror has become. It's a solid thriller, sure, but there's precious little in it that hasn't been seen countless times before, and in the end it plays it safe … by not playing it safe.","50","455407"
"6008","Excellent cast performs well, but not well enough and Paul Schrader's story is strong, but not strong enough. In sum, it neither rolls nor thunders.","50","76637"
"6009","Ingrid Goes West is colorful and flippant enough that it can survive a lot of its more senseless developments, but the movie never digs beneath the most obvious layers of its L.A. stereotypes.","50","5962210"
"6010","It’s no stretch for Kingsley to project stiff dignity and forthrightness, but that familiarity works against him here, despite his every effort to give the character a human pulse. Clarkson, expert at bringing authenticity to the most inauthentic material, gets to show far more range.","50","3062976"
"6011","Watching the Pulitzer-prize winning novel by E. Annie Proulx on the big screen is like being on an ocean liner stuck on a glacier.","50","120824"
"6012","The film's only bright notes are Fred Gwynne's flavorful performance as a bucolic neighbor, his Herman Munster basso in full throttle, and the lovely Maine settings. If Pet Sematary could have boasted more authentic details in telling its devastating story, it might have been a classic instead of just another pet peeve. [25 Apr 1989, p.9D]","50","98084"
"6013","It’s a simple idea, to take this working-class family and introduce what amounts to a high-tech ray gun, but the hook is so effective that it buys Kin a fair amount of time before the story turns from scrappy to stupid.","50","6017942"
"6014","In all, Body of Lies is a mixed bag of treats and trials, but it should be seen by audiences, and emulated and improved upon by other top directors.","50","758774"
"6015","Manages to waste the talents of its strong supporting cast, which includes Thomas Haden Church, Patricia Clarkson, Lisa Kudrow, Malcolm McDowell and Stanley Tucci.","50","1282140"
"6016","A few moments of sly inspiration are not enough to carry an entire feature; along with the tears, it leaves behind an aftertaste of phoniness. [16 March 1990, Friday, p.H]","50","95765"
"6017","Ready to Wear, though it boasts a few small delights, is unready to see.","50","110907"
"6018","Isn't about history or war, or people and their problems, or anything of substance or meaning. It's a movie about other movies. For all its visual bravura and occasional bursts of antic inspiration, it feels trivial, the work of a kid who can't stop grabbing his favorite shiny plaything.","50","361748"
"6019","Surprisingly lacks a feeling of personal urgency and insight that would have made it a distinctive, even unique contribution to the considerable number of films that deal with the war in general and Holocaust in particular.","50","253474"
"6020","Playing a pair of complementary trailblazers that start off on the wrong foot, the duo hand-in-hand elevates Harper’s 1862-set, based-on-a-true-story film, from a flimsy action-adventure to something worth watching on the biggest possible screen, even if it operates on a handful of clichés with little character-based substance to speak of.","50","6141246"
"6021","Despite gorgeous cinematography and a strong cast, The Lost City of Z is a shallow and overly romantic film that falls into the trap of hero worship.","50","1212428"
"6022","Undeniably handsome..., but no cliché is left unturned, right down to the spray of toy soldiers falling from the hand of a dead child. Everything old isn't new again.","50","187393"
"6023","Peter Bogdanovich and his screenwriter, Alvin Sargent, who adapted Joe David Brown's novel, have set out to make a bittersweet comedy that is both in the style of thirties movies and about the thirties. They evoke the time (1936) and the place (rural Kansas and Missouri) so convincingly that their rather sweet formula story seems completely inadequate, even fraudulent.","50","70510"
"6024","Despite a number of trenchant scenes and some startling depictions of sexual degradation, the film has little that's particularly original or enlightening to say about living with a chemical, genetic or emotional imbalance, making its primary function as a showcase for the lead actress to stretch her range.","50","3640682"
"6025","The film is very near a comedy, and I'm not sure that's on purpose.","50","402057"
"6026","Dawson, though, burrows into his role with all the zeal of a perennial second banana recognizing the opportunity of a lifetime. It's the one naturalistic performance in this cartoonish film, carrying with it the implicit authority of years of firsthand experience shaped, perhaps, by some late-night introspection. [13 Nov 1987, p.B]","50","93894"
"6027","You could get drunk, or ill, on the high dose of whimsy in Amelie.","50","211915"
"6028","Hearts sinking, we are obliged to endure much pseudo-serious gabble as we head toward another painfully predictable triumph of the human spirit. There must be some better way of hunting our--and Oscar's--goodwill. [Dec. 1,1997]","50","119217"
"6029","The movie espouses a kind of Unitarian ecumenical egalitarianism that has about as much to do with medieval times as quantum physics. No one should be offended except -- of course -- those who like movies that excite the mind as well as the pulse.","50","320661"
"6030","Lacks originality.","50","425253"
"6031","Bolstered by a solid premise, this film starts out impressively enough - it looks to be a worthy character study. But it soon stops dead, wheels spinning badly, and then, hungry for momentum, lurches off in a completely cockeyed direction. [16 Oct 1992]","50","102307"
"6032","It's clear that Straight Outta Compton is at once too padded and too thin. It's as if the story of these real-life legends was so unruly and dangerous that the filmmakers became the cops, forcing it into submission.","50","1398426"
"6033","It's hard not to be disappointed with The Change-Up, which in the end follows the basic conventions of the switched-identity genre, if more profanely, changing up not much at all.","50","1488555"
"6034","Actually, by way of a sequel, the filmmakers could just set Cerveris, Dafoe, and Reilly up for a purr-off. That’d be more fun than most of this film.","50","450405"
"6035","Carpenter's first directorial effort, an intermittently hilarious satire on 2001--A SPACE ODYSSEY. Carpenter's spaceship is piloted by four goofy astronauts who live like slobs and are bored out of their skulls by their long, uneventful mission.","50","69945"
"6036","Hanks and Ryan are as appealing as ever, and Ephron's fashion-conscious camera gives the action a slickly attractive sheen.","50","128853"
"6037","American movies about childhood often have a spurious feel. They can be grandiosely phony or sentimental--or both, as in Home Alone. Unfortunately, Now and Then, despite massively good intentions, fits right into the program. [20 Oct 1995, p.J]","50","114011"
"6038","The sequel, also directed by Harold Ramis, is painfully padded.","50","289848"

"6041","There's a good idea behind Repo Men, not a whole lot of thinking, but at least one whole idea.","50","1053424"
"6042","Malick continues to float along the edge of the American film world as an unusually intelligent personage who occasionally delivers the fruit of his meditations. But his role as adjunct philosophe is better than the films he eventually gives us.","50","402399"
"6043","As in each of the other recent 3-D movies, of which this is easily the most professional, there is a lot of time devoted to trying out the gimmick. Titles loom toward you. Yo-yos spin. Popcorn bounces. Snakes dart toward the camera and strike. Eventually, the novelty wears off, and what remains is the now-familiar spectacle of nice, dumb kids being lopped, chopped and perforated.","50","83972"
"6044","If the narrative film only exists to give us the unsettling sliminess of Efron as Bundy, it won’t be a total waste. But it’s not much of a movie, either.","50","2481498"
"6045","By the end of the film, you just want to get away from these people.","50","1226774"
"6046","The film is all but crushed by Tom Cruise's screen-hogging demand that everything collapse and swoon around him. If the star gave us more of a rest, we might have more of a movie.","50","116695"
"6047","Halloween isn’t explicitly a horror-comedy, but it does have the destructive habit of undercutting its scares with broad laughs, Green and McBride deflating the tension at every turn with goofball asides.","50","1502407"
"6048","The filmmaking technique of writer-director Kevin Smith has matured since the raunchy ""Clerks,"" his popular debut movie; but although his dialogue is often witty, he still relies on blunt sexual humor to get his point across.","50","118842"
"6049","Instead of taking us someplace we fear to go, Secret Window leads us to a place we've already been -- we know it so well, we could write the book on it ourselves.","50","363988"
"6050","If not all the gags work, the overall irreverence and all-American anomie are fairly contagious.","50","109445"
"6051","Overly familiar industrial product, a big-budgeted entertainment defined by its putatively big concept (apes rule), an underwritten script and a few flashes of Burton's visual genius and gently askew worldview.","50","133152"
"6052","It's a comedy, it's a romance, it's a gangster flick. The Cooler is all of that and much, much less. This is a movie without a compass, switching pace and direction as haphazardly as a caffeinated SUV driver on a cellphone.","50","318374"
"6053","While the filmmakers manage to keep things interesting (sexy, kinky, and ambiguous) much of the time, the self-conscious piety that Frears lavishes on this material places it in an uncertain netherworld that prevents it from ever becoming fully convincing, even as a stylistic exercise.","50","99703"
"6054","Scorsese in his prime might've made better use of this hamming, but this picture feels like an exercise by a Scorsese clone who has tackled the master's themes - without his energy and economy of style.","50","407887"
"6055","A sporadically funny film that has moments of real heart in what’s otherwise a formulaic study of an aggressive businesswoman who learns to stop being so selfish.","50","2702724"
"6056","Ali‘s narrative laxness comes at the fault of boxing time (a good one-third of the film’s three-hour time span is spent inside the ring). You say: But Mann knows how to direct a fight. But I say: So what?","50","248667"

"6060","Admirable in its look and style, the film is not unique or exceptional. Nevertheless, given the state of current science-fiction fare, the film does hold its own.","50","1483013"

"6062","In striving to surprise us every minute with its seen-it-all irony, Guardians Vol. 2 is actually the surprise-spoiler of all time—our every “Wow!” or “Haha!” has been scripted in advance.","50","3896198"
"6063","A fitfully engaging, well-intentioned but disappointing original biographical drama.","50","9206798"

"6065","The silly script lurches from one jarring, implausible moment to another, and Marshall directs like he was wearing earplugs and boxing gloves on the set.","50","100405"
"6066","One gets the feeling Kaufman was so intent on putting fury and fanaticism on-screen, he forgot about having it serve any greater purpose. Which makes Quills the film equivalent of one of de Sade's novels: artifice, without art.","50","180073"
"6067","Hal Ashby directed this intuitive yet amorphous movie, which falls apart when he resorts to melodramatic crosscutting.","50","77362"
"6068","To sum it up, you should see this movie if you have a burning need to waste money to find out an obscure fact about a has-been villain committing an everyday crime - namely, taking that money you just wasted. [20 Sept 1991, p.K]","50","101917"
"6069","The director has dressed up a classic tale in mesmerizing visual overkill without coming close to its dark heart. [13 Nov 1992, p. 56]","50","103874"
"6070","But finally the film is no more than a flamboyant curiosity, replacing the spooky obsessiveness of ""La Jetée"" with a much tamer kind of weirdness. Also with Brad Pitt, in a showy role as a voluble lunatic; he's dreadful.","50","114746"
"6071","Put to the sequel litmus test, queasily spectacular Vengeance would only rate a footnote without a strong original to exploit - or a protracted telephone-terrorist subplot to steal from Dirty Harry 1. [19May1995 Pg.01.D]","50","112864"

"6076","Mr. Holland's Opus is compulsively watchable: Eager to please and never very challenging, it's the kind of movie you might stumble across while channel surfing and watch to the end. Almost despite itself, the movie also manages to celebrate the heroism of the teaching profession with surprisingly moving power. If only it had done it with more grace and less schmaltz. [19 Jan 1996, p.4G]","50","113862"
"6077","Even if every word of Coogler’s account of the last day in Grant’s life held up under close scrutiny, the film would still ring false in its relentlessly positive portrayal of its subject.","50","2334649"

"6079","These are the rules: When watching The Bonfire of the Vanities, you don't think of Tom Wolfe. You think of Dr. Strangelove.

"6080","As with its protagonist, Unknown boasts tantalizing issues buried deep beneath its frantic exterior, but little idea how to unlock or address them.","50","1401152"
"6081","I’d love to see Affleck star in a film about an addict with nothing to explain his addiction but his own flawed, desperate, hungry soul. That’s a movie that could speak to us — the way that Ben Affleck’s real story already does — far more than this modestly well-made Sunday-school lesson.","50","8544498"
"6082","The movie is a mixed bag, with many of the elements fun and intriguing, but since this is also a Michael Bay-produced movie, CG monsters and cartoon bad guys gum up a third act.","50","1464540"

"6091","It's hardly a desecration of Pascal Laugier's 2008 French horror film of the same name, but that assumes the original is a canonical text.","50","1663655"
"6092","In the depiction of sudden, violent death, there is the rhapsodic wallowing in the deadly beauty of it all: protruding arrows, agonizing expiration, etc. It’s the stuff of which slapdash oaters and crime programmers are made but the obvious ambitions of Deliverance are supposed to be on a higher plane.","50","68473"
"6093","""A Dame to Kill For” isn’t the shock to the system “Sin City” was. But whatever its plot repetition and warmed-over tough talk cost it, this is still a movie like few others you’ve ever seen, a 3D slice of Nihilistic noir that will have you narrating your own guts and guns story on the drive home, chewing on a toothpick as you do.","50","458481"
"6094","The songs don’t have the pop or the splendor. The terror and wonder of the intra-pride battles are muted. There is a lot of professionalism but not much heart. It may be that the realism of the animals makes it hard to connect with them as characters, undermining the inspired anthropomorphism that has been the most enduring source of Disney magic.","50","6105098"
"6095","Wall Street is a silly, pretentious melodrama that panders to the current fascination with insider trading. [10 Dec 1987, p.1]","50","94291"
"6096","John Wick reminds you this actor deserves better. Reeves makes the movie entertaining in a background-noise way, but he can’t give it any gravity, even when the filmmakers pull the cheapest trick in the book to get the audience to root for the hero and hiss at the Eurotrash villains. Someone get this man some good work, quick.","50","2911666"
"6097","A movie that may be just a bit too pleased with its own artful bleakness.","50","113627"
"6098","The fine cast is also misused -- especially Kidman, who looks as unruffled at the end of her torments as before they began, and Zellweger, who does a job of overacting that might have gotten rejected by ""The Beverly Hillbillies.""","50","159365"
"6099","Possibly the funniest movie ever made about Catholicism. It confuses the phenomenon of stigmata with satanic possession.","50","145531"
"6100","It’s a strange, grimly comic collection offering many grotesque sight gags, the occasional moment of seriousness and a general wash of melancholic, photogenic, elegiac Old West atmosphere. I liked the least jokey tale the best; by the time it came along, in the fifth-out-of-six slot, I’d had it with the kidding.","50","6412452"
"6101","Levinson’s battling more villains than any script can take on, and by the end, his sharp jabs bleed into a gory finale that settles for cathartic cheers.","50","6205872"
"6102","After a strong takeoff, the film lands on dead grounds.","50","1049413"
"6103","Unfortunately, the inspired concept is coupled with weak screenwriting, and the movie turns out to be much more fun to think about than it is to watch.","50","396269"
"6104","Death Sentence's message - that vengeance is ultimately futile, spinning out a vicious circle of rage and hate - may be commendable, but there's nothing noteworthy about the way Wan, Bacon and their troops go about delivering it.","50","804461"
"6105","Stone works some imaginative changes on the usual formulas of propagandistic fiction—Boyle is anything but the usual bland audience-identification figure, waiting around to be converted to the ideological position of the filmmakers—but as a director, he still didn't have the chops to bring off such an ambitious, multilayered project: the picture lunges into hysterical incoherence every few minutes, and Stone must resort to platitudinous simplifications to clear things up. It's lively, though, to say the very least.","50","91886"
"6106","As a movie, this sort-of sequel to The Rocky Horror Picture Show ain't much—but then neither was the original, and we all know how much difference that made.","50","83067"
"6107","In its own sombre, inflated terms, the picture is effective, but it's dragged out so many self-importantly that you have time to recognize what a hopelessly naive, incompetent, and untrustworthy lawyer the hero is.","50","84855"
"6108","It's campy fun, but if you've seen the previous sequels, the plot grows tiresome and lacks shock value.","50","120694"
"6109","Mystic River wants to be a Bruce Springsteen-like anthem of life and death in blue-collar America. It's no more than a doggerel rendition of poetic injustice.","50","327056"
"6110","An occasionally inventive but ultimately plodding horror film.","50","790686"
"6111","Billy Wilder's 1954 version of the Samuel Taylor staple was a perfect vehicle for Audrey Hepburn, though the cut is too tight for her costars, Humphrey Bogart and William Holden. [Review of re-release]","50","47437"
"6112","Until it becomes completely demented, The Guest is a perfectly respectable thriller, and even when it stops being respectable — even when it goes off the rails and becomes ridiculous — it’s still entertaining.","50","2980592"
"6113","Dark, menacing and sexual, with satanic overtones, like a Black Sabbath song, with many moments of genuine fright and harsh eroticism. [19 September 1986, Daily Notebook, p.76]","50","90756"
"6114","Brief enough, clocking in at 83 minutes, but its story is too predictable to make an impact even in such a short space. Unlike ""Toy Story,"" the dialogue here, written by Todd Alcott and Chris & Paul Weitz, is pro forma all the way.","50","120587"
"6115","It’s alternately wacky and bleak, and despite stunning Korean scenery and a passable chase or two, it feels small-screen. It’s also obvious, with an ending you can guess in the first ten minutes.","50","3967856"
"6116","One can admire it, but it's hard to get caught up in it.","50","120879"
"6117","This comedy is as down-and-dirty as you'd expect from the Farrelly team...but more than one sequence manages to be hilarious on its own outrageously crass terms.","50","129387"
"6118","American Hustle is a movie that was built backward, or inside out: It puts actors’ needs before the audience’s. There’s no heart under those polyester lapels, and what all that Aqua Net is pasting together is a few sparse strands of wispy story.","50","1800241"
"6119","Essentially an episode of ""24."" Which may be a step up from a video game, but it's getting hard to tell.","50","465494"
"6120","A well-acted tale of an underdog's triumph that sorely lacks an underdog, it teeters between pleasantly generic film biography and rank manipulation.","50","1028576"
"6121","Lacks seismic guffaws but elicits many mild smiles.","50","1045778"
"6122","In a way the faults of New Nightmare are the faults of the horror genre as it now exists. Once you get the set-up, the rest of the film is just incidents leading up to the big confrontation. The problem is not in knowing what will happen, but in waiting for it to happen. [14 Oct 1994, p.C3]","50","111686"
"6123","Just when it seemed Albert Brooks had gotten his creative energies under control, along comes this intermittently funny, often overdone comedy that could have been a classic.","50","89504"
"6124","The best science fiction leaves you with questions and ideas to ponder. Arrival is the sort of superficially profound movie that initially seems deep and weighty but stops making sense the moment you put down the bong.","50","2543164"
"6125","If you manage to sit through the whole film, don’t leave before the humorous tag in the credits.","50","287978"
"6126","Nearly wall-to-wall climax -- an unwieldy, two-plus-hours third act of a movie, guided by the principle (incubated by ""Reloaded"" and fully grown here) that too much is never too much.","50","242653"
"6127","A humdrum straight line of a film, Monsters University never surprises, goes off in unexpected directions or throws you for a loop in the manner of the best Pixar stories. Nor does it come close to elating through the sheer imagination of its conceits and storytelling.","50","1453405"
"6128","It’s smooth, and far from inept. But it isn’t much fun. That’s all you want from a certain kind of heist picture, isn’t it? Fun?","50","5164214"
"6129","Dirty Girl is a bad movie with no insights that is broadly drawn and genuinely plagued by filthy dialogue. You don't laugh. You just wince, and wonder how the whole thing ever got financed.","50","1107319"
"6130","Barney's Version misses every opportunity for raucous picaresque fun that the book throws its way, while squandering a wealth of transatlantic performing talent led by Paul Giamatti.","50","1423894"
"6131","There are crisply folded lines, and pleasingly peppery performances from the supporting cast especially, but where its beating heart should be there is a splinter of ice, the sense that no one involved is really doing this for that much love.","50","1473832"
"6132","This time around, the story seems old and tired as well. The result is a routine space opera, an only moderately entertaining finale to a series that has had some great moments. [6 Dec. 1991, p.3D]","50","102975"
"6133","As tempting as it may be to herald Romero as the Swift of schlock, his shopping-mall metaphor is really little more than a clever gag. The director's technique has been refined since his ""Living Dead"" days, but his grasp of characters is still pretty crude, and he reveals himself to be an all-too-predictable liberal moralists when he singles out the woman and the black as the true heroes. These objections should not-and won't-keep Romero loyalists away. For blood, guts and chuckles, most horror fans will undoubtedly find Dawn of the Dead finger-lickin' good. [7 May 1979, p.90]","50","77402"
"6134","Mr. Verhoeven is much better at drumming up this sort of artificial excitement than he is at knowing when to stop.","50","100802"
"6135","iInstead of a buoyant, imaginative superhero movie on the order of Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man"" films or Bryan Singer's ""Superman Returns,"" we get a lumbering, paint-by-numbers origin story.","50","259324"
"6136","Though I wish Please Give were a little better, there aren't enough American movies like it.","50","878835"
"6137","A brave effort to stare down the specter of American failure, it gets off on the wrong foot by pretentiously turning the doomed hero into a Christ figure--a traffic cop with arms extended in crucifixion mode--before the story even gets started.","50","118564"
"6138","Directed by Ron Howard and produced by George Lucas, the film seems to mark the final paroxysm of a genre-the big-budget fantasy-adventure-that dominated American filmmaking for a decade but has recently been weakened by changing tastes, altered economics and sheer exhaustion. It's less a movie than a collection of morbid symptoms: a labored, arrhythmic narrative; a pathetic dependency on recycled themes and borrowed images; a sour, self-mocking humor that suggests the end is near. [20 May 1988, p.2]","50","96446"
"6139","The Girl on the Train is less a thriller than a morality tale reminding us never to make snap judgments. No matter how dreadfully some characters behave, we’re not allowed to dislike anyone for long. That kind of catharsis isn’t allowed.","50","3631112"
"6140","There's a lightheartedness to the film that belies its genre, however. As one of the dimmer of the dwindling party says, after the body count has reached three, ""You gotta look on the bright side of things."" April Fool's Day eventually does, but the mild satisfaction of its climactic twist does not redeem the tedium of the first 88 minutes. [29 Mar 1986, p.B4]","50","90655"
"6141","Redford's storytelling skills aren't strong enough to make the tale appear as seamless as it should.","50","119314"
"6142","Fails to go into the one realm that would make it worthwhile, which is Ed Wood's brain.","50","109707"
"6143","Vanderbilt chooses to present the tale with a lighter comic touch in the early stages, and it’s a tone the picture can’t overcome in its final third.","50","3859076"
"6144","Ritt's film must respond to the needs of an entertainment industry, and in its desire to be uplifting, leaves its characters one-dimensional without ensuring that the one dimension is heroic.","50","69303"
"6145","This sort of investigation has been done so masterfully by Sam Peckinpah in ""The Wild Bunch"" and Oliver Stone in ""Natural Born Killers"" that, in a sternly utilitarian sense, we don't need Cronenberg. He is not, as far as I have seen, in their class. He proves it again in A History of Violence.","50","399146"
"6146","Once again, the filmmaker gets incredibly wobbly at the end of his story, and his resolution of both the alien incursion and of Graham's crisis of faith feels more like a cheap trick than the product of a genuine belief in anything at all.","50","286106"
"6147","Alas, Schumacher doesn't ride on the momentum; worse, he's not an action director, and the film grinds to a dead stop every time it tries to speed up.","50","112462"
"6148","Those looking for sheer gore for its own sake probably won't be disappointed by Hellraiser III, but those expecting the quality of the first film in the series most likely will be. [14 Sep 1992, p.F8]","50","104409"
"6149","The meticulously crafted world is stunning to behold, imagined to the minutest detail and photographed with the sort of dramatic lighting and dynamic camera movement rarely seen in stop-motion. Trouble is, it’s not a place most folks would care to spend any time.","50","787474"
"6150","Well-intentioned even as it surrenders to commercialism, G.I. Jane comes on like the ultimate battle of the sexes. But it ends up being an unfulfilling exercise in pseudo-feminism. [22 August 1997, p. 7D]","50","119173"
"6151","Land of Mine is essentially bomb porn.","50","3841424"
"6152","What is offered instead is merely gruesome. The trail leads to a sagging, swamp-view motel and to one of the messiest, most nau seating murders ever filmed. At close range, the camera watches every twitch, gurgle, convulsion and hemorrhage in the process by which a living human becomes a corpse...The nightmare that follows is expertly gothic, but the nausea never disappears.","50","54215"
"6153","Parnassus is a cold film that delights in dancing along that fine line separating ""fantastical"" and ""nonsensical."" Then, when a movie is supposed to hit things home -- in that all-important third act -- it lands with a thud on the wrong side.","50","1054606"
"6154","Save for one startlingly staged battle sequence. . .might as well have been titled ""Also Ran.""","50","89881"
"6155","Even Del Toro can't raise the conceptually dead.","50","187738"
"6156","Perfectly acceptable, perfectly bland, competently acted but by no means a scary horror movie, in which ""they"" are coming to get people.","50","283632"
"6157","A movie that has more sap than a pine forest.","50","892318"
"6158","Two of Hollywood's best-loved veterans deserved a far better swan song than this sticky confection.","50","82846"
"6159","It has a basic goodness of heart that counteracts, if not entirely cancels out, the film's broadness and busyness.","50","1174730"
"6160","As Laurel and Hardy learn by the end of the film, every gig is an opportunity. Good on Coogan and Reilly for possessing the same workhorse mentality – and better luck next time, boys.","50","3385524"
"6161","Like Jay Roach's Game Change and Recount, the film's patina of relative apoliticism masks (or enables) its blandness of inquiry.","50","3203606"
"6162","Like a traumatized psyche, it remains uncomfortably stuck in the past, replaying familiar events in an effort to empty them of terror.","50","5606664"
"6163","If the plot thins, the performances don't. Brad Pitt's lank-haired loony, Juliette Lewis's crippled innocent, David Duchovny's well-meaning hypocrite, Michelle Forbes' black-clad shutterbug - each is a deeply etched portrait that fulfills its early promise. [24 Sep 1993]","50","107302"
"6164","The film falters in the moments where it can't decide if it's an entertainment about a likable criminal, or a serious commentary on the exploitation of the Third World.","50","399295"
"6165","For the most part, the movie’s ideas about Barnum are incredibly stupid and, at times, kind of sweet in their daftness.","50","1485796"
"6166","The movie is polished, well-acted and atmospheric, but still pure formula, and not very scary, either.","50","309698"
"6167","A sentimental comedy about mental illness (complete with a sitcom family), wobbly Bob offers further evidence that Disney itself may be afflicted with encroaching schizophrenia. [17 May 1991]","50","103241"
"6168","It is also glib, shallow, and monotonous, a movie that spends so much time sanctifying its hero that, despite his ""innocence,"" he ends up seeming about as vulnerable as Superman.","50","109830"
"6169","It all adds up to something less powerful and interesting than the original.","50","368008"
"6170","Why Him? plays a fairly one-note game that gets tiresome halfway through, which is sadly still better than most comedies put out this year.","50","4501244"
"6171","Disappointingly dumb.","50","186151"
"6172","Apart from the flash new environment, this version vaunts its modernity by vulgarising everything in sight, making the characters mouthpieces for foul language and equally foul sentimentality","50","75265"
"6173","Like the sitcom version of a Woody Allen film, full of amusing lines and scenes, all infused with an uncomfortable sense of deja vu.","50","98635"
"6174","Zemeckis intends to give us a slightly more depraved version of Washington's usual charismatic hero, then pull the rug out from him. But Flight's true downward spiral is its own loss of momentum.","50","1907668"
"6175","It skews very young, and for that crowd, Hotel Transylvania 2 works well enough. If this is Sandler’s sentence for all the awful, lazy live-action fare he’s fed his fans over the years, he and we can say he got off easy.","50","2510894"
"6176","An overwrought, underwritten hootchy-kootchy tuner that desperately wants to be ""Cabaret,"" but lacks the edge and historical context to pull it off.","50","1126591"
"6177","I don't mean to unduly target Kill Bill Vol. 2 --it's certainly no worse than most of the blam-blam fare out there. But what I crave now are movies that speak to me in a different way about violence, that acknowledge the fact that real people are harmed.","50","378194"
"6178","It's a muddled, sometimes-atmospheric effort.","50","229260"
"6179","Just because it's a good idea doesn't mean it's easy to do well. Screenwriter-turned-director Kurt Wimmer has a hard time keeping his actors from, well, acting a lot of the time.","50","238380"
"6180","An Officer and a Gentleman has so many echoes that it never finds its own voice. [29 Jul 1982]","50","84434"
"6181","Roald Dahl's implausible script is padded out with the usual exotic locations, stunts, and trickery.","50","62512"
"6182","Joe himself is an amazing creation, less personable, to be sure, than the original lovelorn King Kong, but a far more fully realized character than any of the flesh and blood humans by whom he's surrounded.","50","120751"
"6183","This is the kind of movie that mistakes heartbreak for being housebroken.","50","120646"
"6184","An unholy mess that becomes steadily more incoherent -- morally, dramatically, and conceptually.","50","119229"
"6185","The first 30 minutes of this film feel like a fever dream, as Hannaford and his entourage trade barbs while the film stock (and subjects) change like a child’s kaleidoscope. It is frenetic and a bit unsettling. But once the party settles in at the director’s estate, it becomes mildly coherent.","50","69049"
"6186","This is a nearly universal theme and might provide the spine for a funny comedy. [29 July 1983, p.C1]","50","85995"
"6187","Noah Baumbach’s latest wisp of privileged New York whimsy vaporizes on arrival.","50","2872462"
"6188","The movie wastes a good opportunity to look at important questions, such as who's responsible for American policy when the president is busy killing terrorists.","50","118571"
"6189","Strains through buckets of verbiage and muddled plot to seize only a few dopey laughs.","50","113749"
"6190","The film, directed by Joel Silberg in and around Los Angeles, employs a very small story that is meant to be functional but still interrupts the dancing far too often.","50","86998"
"6191","A well-acted, well-crafted but excruciatingly tepid romantic film about a subject that will attract poetry lovers and yet test even their considerable patience.","50","810784"
"6192","Meandering ... The film somehow lacks the structural cogency necessary to support a compelling narrative, while also encompassing enough discernible plot conventions to reveal a screenwriter’s meddling.","50","8019694"
"6193","Like ""Little Miss Sunshine,"" the movie stars Toni Collette and Steve Carell in a story about a dysfunctional family trip, though like ""Adventureland,"" it’s really about a teenager finding acceptance at a local theme park.","50","1727388"
"6194","Brooks has an uncanny talent for making us feel insightful.","50","371246"
"6195","The film's aesthetic is marked by off-tempo editing and a tone that vacillates between grim and coy, and though it's occasionally visually evocative, it's also unmistakably over-calculated.","50","2179116"
"6196","Tintin is exhausting, and, for all its wonders, it wears one out well before it's over.","50","983193"
"6197","A collection of shots and characters designed to circle the globe rather than to say anything much about either the filmmakers or the audience, a triumph of multinational capital at work rather than of people or ideas.","50","120201"
"6198","Although Body Snatchers is a competent genre piece with Freudian fillips, there's little there to justify another go-round for what is by now very familiar material.","50","106452"
"6199","The acting and crooning are sadly uneven, making this a shaky comeback vehicle for the screen musical.","50","293508"
"6200","The elliptical narrative also recalls Fernando Meirelles' somewhat similarly themed ""The Constant Gardener,"" a film ultimately more heartfelt and accessible to mainstream audiences because its maker is unafraid of grief and explores it more deeply.","50","829459"
"6201","Machete is a drinking man's ""The Expendables.""","50","985694"
"6202","Will please fans of Sara Gruen's best seller, but it lacks the vital spark that would have made the drama truly compelling on the screen.","50","1067583"
"6203","About Alex is about too much and too little, a sandbox for its considerable cast, but ultimately just following the reunion rulebook.","50","2667918"
"6204","8-year-olds of all ages, prepare to storm the multiplex!","50","418279"
"6205","My deepest objection to the movie is that it is so blood-soaked. When dialogue arrives to interrupt the carnage, it's like the seventh-inning stretch.","50","416449"
"6206","You can see what an impact sound must have had in 1927, because it certainly wasn't the movie that made this production a phenomenon...It's ragged and dull until the magical moment when Jolson turns to the camera to announce, “You ain't heard nothin' yet”—a line so loaded with unconscious irony that it still raises a few goose bumps.","50","18037"
"6207","A weak whinny of a horse opera tailor-made for those who can't quite locate ""Young Guns"" or ""The Long Riders"" in their video store.","50","244000"
"6208","It's a film of unquestioned visual artistry, and the filmmakers' empathy and human understanding are apparent moment to moment, scene by scene. But despite sensitive performances, it's an experiment that fizzles.","50","449467"
"6209","It's taken a while for Kane to make it to the big screen, maybe because fantasy barbarians and long-ago kings have more immediate appeal than pious, slouch-hat-wearing men with poor senses of humor, but Solomon Kane gives it a go anyway. The results suggest a compelling movie could be made from the material, even if it isn't this one.","50","970452"
"6210","It pains me to say this. I spent a good deal of Us straining to like it, to get on its slightly preening wavelength, to be nourished by its heady stew of tropes. I couldn’t get there, though. As loaded up on stuff as Us is, there’s not enough to grab onto; it’s an alienating idea piece that lumbers away just as it’s about to reveal its true nature.","50","6857112"
"6211","This new interpretation does few things better than the original, and many things worse.","50","155267"
"6212","The film is one continuous spurt of energy...But the picture is abstract in an adolescent way. Miller's attempt to tap into the universal concept of the hero (as enunciated by Jung and explicated by Joseph Campbell in ""The Hero with a Thousand Faces"") makes the film joyless.","50","82694"
"6213","Contains no shocks. But it works as a funny and slicker-than-expected parody of the genre.","50","426459"
"6214","The film is so self-conscious it seems to be dictating your every reaction.","50","1440292"
"6215","The Brothers Bloom is much more interested in showing off its own smarts, such as they are, than in challenging the audience's.","50","844286"
"6216","The Fog is constructed of random diversions. There are too many story lines, which necessitate so much cross-cutting that no one sequence can ever build to a decent climax. The movie looks quite pretty but prettiness of this sort is beside the point in such a film.","50","80749"
"6217","Skin Deep, the latest and 36th off the line, could sum up his whole checkered career - it's that good and that bad, by turns terrifically funny and terribly flawed. [3 March 1989]","50","98343"
"6218","What ultimately hobbles War Horse is a two-pronged attack, with Spielberg's soft-sell producing an unfortunately dramatic flatness in almost every scene, while an 11th-hour scramble for picture-book catharsis doesn't seem to work either.","50","1568911"
"6219","Every movie, even a remake, deserves to be viewed on its own merits. But that’s easier stated than done when you have a film like Downhill, a largely inferior American knockoff that's far less dynamic than the 2014 dark comedy it's based on.","50","4558376"
"6220","For a movie that presents itself as formally inventive, developments in Brad’s Status are a little too easy to guess.","50","5884230"
"6221","A great-looking but torturously slow and often hokey cross between ""The Exorcist"" and ""Dirty Harry.""","50","360486"
"6222","The singer-actress' saucy, glamorously wry performance makes up for some of the film's inherent predictability.","50","1198138"
"6223","Ultimately, Chechik can't pull off the fractured-fairy-tale aspect of Benny and Joon. His film never explains mental illness, but romanticizes it, making it seem like a state of enchantment. It's ultimately irresponsible, and not very funny. [16 Apr 1993, p.C1]","50","106387"
"6224","This rotely cheeky, Anglo-plastic adultery comedy is set in the golden-green English countryside, and it makes a few quirky nods toward artistry, but it's really just a glib concoction.","50","1486190"
"6225","The creators of Superman III give us a picture puzzle of assorted plots that never meld coherently. [13 June 1983]","50","86393"
"6226","Perhaps because Jenkins can’t translate to the screen the incisiveness and music of Baldwin’s prose, he brings on real music from other sources. Over and over, and increasingly as the movie wears on, Jenkins drowns his film in mirthless jazz and pop interludes to the point that the action feels stuck in cement.","50","7125860"
"6227","Revenge was supposed to be the one that really socked it to us, about Anakin's almost biblical fall from grace. But the movie never rises to its powerful occasion.","50","121766"
"6228","The picture is an overworked trifle: There's so much going on in it that it becomes hard to care about ANYTHING that's going on in it. The story in Stranger Than Fiction is stranger than fiction. But what good is it if it's unreadable?","50","420223"
"6229","In The Conspirator, one wishes that the director had found the grace to touch upon, rather than belabor, the parallels between the conspirators of 1865 and the present-day inmates of Guantánamo.","50","968264"
"6230","Outside of its major assets, which include “I, Tonya” scene-stealer Paul Walter Hauser’s unapologetically showy performance as Jewell and Sam Rockwell’s sardonic turn as his underdog lawyer, there’s a mystifying lack of clarity to the dramatic impact this retelling is seeking.","50","3513548"
"6231","There are waves of brilliantly orchestrated anxiety and confusion but also long stretches of drab, hackneyed exposition that flatten the atmosphere. We might be watching ""Cold Case"" or ""Criminal Minds,"" but with better sound design and more expressive visual techniques.","50","1568346"
"6232","It’s the rare instance when you can see this great actor laboriously acting.","50","6000478"
"6233","The main reason for Winter's Bone to exist is that it delivers a little voyeuristic thrill -- a bit of poverty porno -- for the critics who awarded it their highest honors at this year's Sundance Film Festival.","50","1399683"
"6234","What could have served as a colorful episode in a more expansive film about the famed singer has instead become the premise of a mildly entertaining but overextended road movie that doesn't succeed on either dramatic or comedic terms.","50","338075"
"6235","Compared to other, similar offbeat monster movies, Grabbers is under-realized. It isn’t as smartly plotted or funny as Tremors, nor as politically charged as The Host.","50","1525366"
"6236","With a surprisingly unhappy, anti-Hollywood ending that will appeal to those who like things dark.","50","289879"
"6237","One of the most frustrating films of 1990, an epic without epic scope, a muted, strained, unnatural affair that never comes into dramatic focus.","50","99674"
"6238","Has a lot going for it, but two-thirds of the way through, things fall apart. The film’s weaknesses are directly tied to the narrative.","50","364045"
"6239","What a featherweight epic this is, the kind of uniformed period piece where the watchword is pretty. Pretty costumes, pretty soldiers, pretty battles; pretty silly.","50","240510"
"6240","You couldn't accuse the film of practicing what it preaches: careful stewardship of a precious resource.","50","1482459"
"6241","The good news is that Vaughn is back in needling, loosey-goosey mode in Made, which he produced with Favreau. The bad news is that by the end, not only do you find him quite resistible, but you also may wish one of the tough guys of this mob comedy would heave him out a window.","50","227005"
"6242","That the film mostly falls flat has far more to do with the largely unconvincing material rather than with the co-stars, who are more than game for often clownish shenanigans Black and his co-writer Anthony Bagarozzi have concocted for them; in fit and starts, the actors display a buoyant comic rapport.","50","3799694"
"6243","For a movie about proud outcasts, Slash is a little square.","50","4729990"
"6244","An artsy bore.","50","1149362"
"6245","You can't have Rushmore without Max, and though Anderson obviously planned it this way, the kid is finally too off-putting to tolerate.","50","128445"
"6246","Summer fluff that admits to being summer fluff, but it's no better off for admitting it...Intended as lightweight comedy, but if you think about it too much, it's not so funny.","50","119654"
"6247","The movie's afraid of [Stiles], turning Kat from riot grrrrl to Solid Gold dancer in the time it takes to drop one Notorious B.I.G. song at that house party - which is why it's the Spam of processed teen movies.","50","147800"
"6248","Like so many movies that depend on effects for effect, plot comes in a poor second to spectacle. That leaves the Fraser, funny and sexy as hell, left with little chance to prove it.","50","166276"
"6249","The filmmakers peddle fear and then try to claim the moral high ground; the treatment is foolish, confused, and borderline irresponsible.","50","133952"
"6250","But Monsters, Inc. -- directed by Pixar soldier Pete Docter, not by master digital comic John Lasseter -- turns out to be stingy on context, commentary, and the prism-ing view of pop culture that made the earlier films mint.","50","198781"
"6251","Hellboy's cheeky attitude and snarky dialogue, specifically Perlman's snidely funny lines, are the highlights.","50","167190"
"6252","The only good thing about this would-be camp version of the classic 1936 serial is the impressive production design by Danilo Donati.","50","80745"
"6253","The remake adds 24 minutes and subtracts most of the suspense.","50","381849"
"6254","There's something about that extra layer of distancing that a book can offer and the screen can't, which in this case might account for why film viewers feel vaguely discomforted by an icky fifth-wheel sensation.","50","120669"
"6255","There is something too dry and austere about Greengrass and Ray’s telescoped vision, which touches only fleetingly on the pirates’ motives, the suffering of the Somali people and the collateral damage of global capitalism.","50","1535109"
"6256","The cast seems to have been assembled primarily for its blinking resemblance to the stars of the original Eighties TV series about a renegade group of former Army Rangers now for hire.","50","429493"
"6257","It's Middle America vs. big bad corporate America, and while the (not so) ""bad guy"" predictably finds salvation in salt-of-the-earth people, Promised Land often leaves a sour taste in your mouth.","50","2091473"
"6258","Most of the chills have been faithfully re-created, though first-time screenwriter Stephen Susco hasn't done much to straighten out the muddled narrative.","50","391198"
"6259","Hall is very funny as the energetic adolescent pest and a good supporting cast includes the Cusack sibings John and Joan.","50","88128"
"6260","An audacious premise gets dangerously unstable execution in Four Lions, a ballsy but wobbly high-concept farce that sends up the bumbling schemes of a Blighty-based jihadist cell.","50","1341167"
"6261","In their overly earnest attempt to flesh Sendak’s story out to 100 minutes, Jonze and his co-screenwriter, novelist Dave Eggers, have laboriously spelled out motivations (divorce is bad!), elaborated back stories -- and added reams of less-than-inspired dialogue.","50","386117"
"6262","Well, we're not in ""Chicago"" anymore, or even its soundstage approximation, but that hasn't stopped Oscar-nominated director Rob Marshall from fashioning another epic spectacle out of two squabbling women in (a sort-of) show business.","50","397535"
"6263","It's an ambitious film -- but also a scattered, unfocused one.","50","112641"
"6264","Jurassic World can't tell whether it wants to be junk food or not, lovingly poking fun at some Hollywood tropes while shamelessly indulging others.","50","369610"
"6265","Unfortunately, director Robert Wise has no feeling for Trek's pop insouciance, and the movie unfolds ponderously.","50","79945"
"6266","That the film doesn't live up to our anticipation of a rolicking good time is only part of its disappointment. [11 June 1986]","50","91042"
"6267","Not exactly an unholy mess, but still a rather too pious retread of classic sci-fi/action/horror riffs that lacks originality or pizzazz.","50","822847"
"6268","Starts out strong and boasts a convincing picture of the post-war world as an anarchic desert. But it comes to ditch its fun stylization for vague themes of religiosity and morality, leaving you with a disappointingly muddled movie.","50","1037705"
"6269","Though the movie is riddled with memorable scenes of violence, its pace is slow -- too slow. It has an epic sprawl, but it's not an epic. It's more like a bloated fairy tale. [7 Aug 1992]","50","105695"
"6270","At bottom, Lethal Weapon isn't much. It's a big, shallow, flashy, buddy-buddy cop thriller; it attacks you like a stereophonic steamroller, flattening everything behind it. Snatches of ""Hustle"" ""Magnum Force"" and ""48 HRS."" float above this plot like scum on a polluted lake, and the holes in logic and mindless climax are (or should be) embarrassing. [6 Mar 1987, p.4]","50","93409"
"6271","The Client is slick, but not much more than the sum of its surfaces. [20 July 1994, p.23]","50","109446"
"6272","Needless to say, what's refreshing about A Christmas Story is subversive to the sepia-toned and loving references to the forties which director Bob Clark has provided for the film. The fictional Parker family that Shepherd has written about for 20 years is not as gentle or gauzy as they first appear. It's possible to imagine them so preoccupied with their own problems, whether dealing with the neighbor's dogs or winning a mail- order contest, that they could forget Christmas altogether. [25 Nov 1983, p.E5]","50","85334"
"6273","It's too involved in administering its reversion fantasy to acquisition-guilty yuppies to cast an eye on its own venture status. And the contradictions don't stop there. That this celebration of the Peter Pan syndrome was directed by a woman, Penny Marshall, adds another layer of dishonesty. [3 Jun 1988, p.31]","50","94737"
"6274","I'm a notorious softie, and I found things to like about the film, most particularly Clooney's performance; but I remained untouched.","50","1033575"
"6275","Is, in its way, an apolitical comedy about politics. Or at least a naïve one, since those weapons likely eventually made their way into the hands of Al Qaeda.","50","472062"
"6276","Yes, it's a collection of barbs and sick jokes, but it's not fun, and it lacks a punch line...The young, inexperience director, Michael Lehmann, doesn't find the right mood for the gags. [17 Apr 1989]","50","97493"
"6277","She (Kazan) also wrote the screenplay, which begs interpretation as a frustrated actress's commentary on the way that even ostensibly serious writers write women - that is, for maximum convenience. Still, the direction, from Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris (Little Miss Sunshine), is never more than workmanlike.","50","1839492"
"6278","A film that not only breaks the cross-dressing barrier but also ratchets up the violence level for children's animation.","50","120762"
"6279","It's a faux epic -- swell costumes, historically authentic settings, a certain amount of bustle and skulking, but very little dramatically gripping activity.","50","414055"
"6280","See it to be reminded (if you need further reminding) of this actress' remarkable range. Otherwise, take a pass.","50","188453"
"6281","It reaches a peak of dramatic anguish in star Rachel Weisz's single moment of naked fury, rather than through the tenacity and compassion that define her crusading title character.","50","896872"
"6282","Soderbergh whiplashes his viewers between two contrasting mental states that are best described as ""jaunty"" and ""wrenching.""","50","1130080"
"6283","The Island walks a weird, wobbly line between being stupid, falsely fattened-up entertainment and a picture that just might have possibly been made by a person with a brain -- a scrambled one, but a brain nonetheless.","50","399201"
"6284","Director Alfred Hitchcock goes nattering on with an hour of some silly plot-boiling about a flirtatious society girl (Tippi Hedren), a lovelorn schoolmarm (Suzanne Pleshette), an Oedipus wreck (Rod Taylor) and a pair of lovebirds. Hitchcock addicts will just be getting jittery for their first fix of gore when it suddenly becomes clear that the birds is coming: man's feathered friends set themselves to wipe out an entire village on the California coast. Why did the birds go to war? Hitchcock does not tell, and the movie flaps to a plotless end.","50","56869"
"6285","By the two-hour mark the fun had oozed out of the movie for me. It's long. Or feels it.","50","1853728"
"6286","Funny things, images. While to depict something visually is not necessarily to endorse it, when Bigelow shows rape as she does in Strange Days, she does so from the rapist's point of view. It's kind of like making a movie about the dangers of the atom bomb that glamorizes the aesthetic beauty of the mushroom cloud. [13 Oct 1995, p.05]","50","114558"
"6287","After it's over, one thing is perfectly clear. Joe Versus the Volcano, for all its wacky gags, delightfully bizarre look and ill-fated attempts at insight, is only one thing: Mediocre. [9 Mar 1990, p.5]","50","99892"
"6288","Waving a dubious flag of feminist inclusivity, Cole and screenwriter William Ivory turn cartwheels insisting that girl power, even in the 1960s, trumped class divisions.","50","1371155"
"6289","John Krasinski’s second feature has such a milquetoast, melancholy-indie sound that its most arresting and dynamic musical moment comes when three characters unexpectedly break into “Closer To Fine” by the Indigo Girls.","50","3714720"
"6290","A slightly above-average actioner that tries to compensate for tissue-thin-plot with ever-more-grisly death sequences and impressive special effects.","50","93773"
"6291","What begins brightly gets bogged down over 140 minutes. A film that took off like a hare on speed ends like a winded tortoise.","50","264464"
"6292","Deals with emotional concerns for half an hour. Then it turns into a mindless bloodfest, where it's impossible to care which characters end on the zombie gore-gasbord.","50","463854"
"6293","It's hard to get swept away when you're struggling to figure out who's doing what to whom and why.","50","365737"
"6294","Yet the movie, distilling into purest form the blend of viciousness and sentimentality that informs all Woo's work, winds up as emotionally bogus as it is viscerally overwhelming.","50","119094"
"6295","This is all very strange and a little tedious. Yet there is something arresting and oddly poignant in Mr. Van Sant's playful vision of the road to nowhere. [3 Oct 1991, p.A14(E)]","50","102494"
"6296","Its straight-ahead rape, humiliation and ingenious revenge competently executed but not aestheticized, the essential grunginess never overly slicked up.","50","1242432"
"6297","A disorganized, rambling and eccentric movie that contains some moments of truth, some moments of humor, and many moments of digression.","50","101889"
"6298","So action-packed from start to finish that the final result is grating rather than thrilling.","50","209163"
"6299","I can’t say it wasn’t interesting to sit through, but Thieves never rises above a seriously long-winded B-movie, a shoot-em-up in which no matter how graphic the violence that the characters mete out and witness, nobody ever lets you forget they’re playing cops and robbers.","50","1259528"
"6300","Anyone expecting a shred of originality from this Dwayne Johnson vehicle will be disappointed, but writer-director Rawson Marshall Thurber tries his best to compensate by amping up the over-the-top spectacle, hoping sheer gusto will keep viewers from minding his film’s shaky foundation.","50","5758778"
"6301","The animated feature The Red Turtle is about as far as you can get from a typical cartoon movie musical. Except for a few tsunami crashes and howls, this lovely but tortoise-paced work from the celebrated Japanimation house Studio Ghibli is basically a silent film.","50","3666024"
"6302","The Force Awakens boils down to a couple of genuine lump-in-the-throat moments, and those are due to nostalgia. The rest? Seen it, done it, been there, and remember it — even though it was “a long time ago.”","50","2488496"
"6303","If Insidious 2 exists solely because Insidious 1 made a ton of money, then at least credit Wan for making quality control a priority.","50","2226417"
"6304","Something got lost in the move from storyboard to screen, and in the stretch from seven minutes to 103. [27 June 1988]","50","96438"
"6305","Despite its inadequacies, Basquiat presents a fascinating glimpse of the Eighties art scene, due in large measure to several stunning performances.","50","115632"
"6306","The movie is curious in how close it comes to delivering on its material: Sequence after sequence seems to contain all the necessary material, to be well on the way toward a payoff, and then it somehow doesn't work.","50","97958"
"6307","Ultimately, the heavy-handed and annoyingly obvious aesthetic wears thin.","50","1120985"
"6308","A nagging question persists throughout Darkest Hour: Is Oldman’s compulsively meticulous turn here anything more than a brilliant impersonation? The answer is yes, but it’s a performance that always stands apart from the rest of the film.","50","4555426"
"6309","The film's main problems are script-related. Most of the stories aren't merely perfunctory; they're superficial.","50","817230"
"6310","Instead of digging into the psychology and morality of greed, Mr. Jarecki only glances and lectures in that direction before piling on a lot of melodramatic complications, including a death, an investigation and a cynical detective (Tim Roth). These days, it seems, the illegal manipulation of hundreds of millions of dollars simply isn't enough to incite moral outrage.","50","1764183"
"6311","Tries for both civilized wit and primitive joy -- and mostly misses both.","50","219822"
"6312","Tthough it is action packed, spectacularly edited and often quite funny, one can't help feeling that Carpenter is squeezing the last drops out of a fatigued genre. Ten years ago this would have been one wild and crazy movie; in this era of ruthlessly efficient entertainments, it's a rather one-note evening. [14 July 1986, p.69]","50","90728"
"6313","Forgetting Sarah Marshall follows the Apatow formula faithfully enough. All that's missing is charisma -- the je ne sais quois that makes us fall in love in the first place.","50","800039"
"6314","Think “Lord of the Flies,” without all the jerks.","50","1790864"
"6315","State and Main is a Hollywood satire as cynical and thickheaded as its supposed targets.","50","120202"
"6316","Walking Tall, which is credited to four different writers, is wanting for a reason to be.","50","351977"
"6317","Predictably, the derivative title here is a jumping-off point for another derivative slasher-revenge pic. [17 October 1997, p.5D]","50","119345"
"6318","The performances and the inherent power of the true story keep it from being a complete disaster, but one hopes Serkis moves on to more challenging material with his follow-up.","50","5716464"
"6319","To find that valuable truth, you have to dig through an avalanche of d--- jokes and strenuous slapstick.","50","829482"
"6320","Neeson's tormented weariness lends an air of dignity to the film's pulpy, grubby nastiness, but as striking as he is in action-hero mode, the truth is that Taken doesn't need dignity.","50","936501"
"6321","That's the moral nut of this highly unexceptional episode, a midlife production in which each Enterprise crew member does his or her vaudeville act.","50","120844"
"6322","After allowing sadistic violence and whining children to invade his movie like a horde of termites, Carr tries to put one over on us by tacking on a sentimental ending. But as any homeowner could have told him, you can't disguise a weak foundation with a cheap finish.","50","422774"
"6323","The trouble is, the kids seem to be in one earnest ""After School Special""-type of movie, while the adults occupy a retro-futuristic world more like the original TV show.","50","167456"
"6324","Sure, it’s good-looking, cautionary and clever enough. But there’s not much in this “Game” that you’d call thrilling or fun.","50","1731141"
"6325","I expected more from a movie about the most feared man in America for half a century. Whatever else you think about him, in retrospect, he had balls of brass - an essential quality replaced in J. Edgar by dull indifference.","50","1616195"
"6326","No, the trouble isn't with them but with a screenplay (by Angus MacLachlan) that loads their characters with too much symbolic baggage and then points them off in obscure directions.","50","1423995"
"6327","I think the movie intends to empower all of its female characters, but it ends up chaining them to stale, timeworn ideas.","50","1001508"
"6328","Ultimately there's more guilt than pleasure to be found in The Craft. [03 May 1996]","50","115963"
"6329","Night of the Living Dead is a grainy little movie acted by what appear to be nonprofessional actors, who are besieged in a farm house by some other nonprofessional actors who stagger around, stiff-legged, pretending to be flesh-eating ghouls.","50","63350"
"6330","Comes off as a derivative wisecracking machine rather than a feat of sustained imagination.","50","1001526"
"6331","Less a character study than an impressionistic portrait of a troubled artist's internal chaos, it supplies just enough Miles Davis to leave us jonesing for more.","50","790770"
"6332","Pacino is a one-man three-ring circus, blustering, capering, cursing, raging and weaseling his way through this predictable morality play like a trickster Satan on speed.","50","417217"
"6333","The problem with The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is this: The closer the many-hands screenplay gets to the Christ-like sufferings and resurrection of Lord Aslan, the lion (voiced by Liam Neeson), the more conflicted the filmmakers' efforts become.","50","363771"
"6334","Altered States can be accused of many things, but never of harboring a new idea. Because the script's lessons have been drowned in fruity religious imagery, Altered States is at most an accomplished horror film, the kind of stomach-churning movie to which people like David Cronenberg aspire. [23 Jan 1981]","50","80360"
"6335","It's all densely imagined and more than a little goofy -- perhaps too goofy for the average American viewer.","50","119116"
"6336","Even for a fairly low-budget movie, Tusk doesn’t feel thought-through, or focused enough.","50","3099498"
"6337","It's in the moments Abrams attempts to combine emotional payoffs with popcorn-style thrills that the film rings most false.","50","1650062"
"6338","An inflated sci-fi action-horror film...[Cameron] does it in an energetic, systematic, relentless way, with an action dicretor's gusto, and a shortage of imagination. The imagery has a fair amount of graphic power, but there's too much claustrophobic blue-green darkness.","50","90605"
"6339","Lacks the special creative spark needed to lift it to an uncommon imaginative level.","50","118617"
"6340","Except for a couple of isolated, mildly subversive moments, Hanks is basically playing the genial host of “The Wonderful World of Disney’’ rather than an actual person.","50","2140373"
"6341","These pros lift this button-pushing blob of faux folksiness to a higher plane than it deserves.","50","327137"
"6342","The supporting cast provides centripetal force; too bad the center cannot hold.","50","106918"
"6343","A tepid disappointment that contains one mediocre chase scene and a lot of wasted talent.","50","187078"
"6344","The title refers to a diorama at New York City's American Museum of Natural History that depicts a whale and a giant squid locked in mortal combat.","50","367089"
"6345","Turns Jane Austen's nimble satire into a lumbering gothic romance.","50","414387"
"6346","It's also one of those movies that is itself so lethargic that one welcomes its so-called shock moments not because they are scary but because they indicate that not everyone behind the camera has been napping. You don't dread the possibility of something jumping out from behind the door. You long for it.","50","82533"
"6347","The physical stunts by Maggie Q as a lethal martial arts expert and Cyril Raffaelli as a Eurotrash sniper who rappels buildings are more thrilling than the over-the-top chase sequences, so contrived as to verge on self-parody.","50","337978"
"6348","Locke, as fascinating as it is in theory, never evolves into anything more than a glorified acting exercise.","50","2692904"
"6349","A sweet but curiously unfulfilling story.","50","181875"
"6350","The cast does great impressions of the original cartoon characters, and the computer-generated Scooby is convincing, but it turns out that what we liked about Scooby-Doo in the first place was that nobody was trying.","50","267913"
"6351","If you can't be original, why not borrow from something no one has seen, like Ben Affleck's last five movies?","50","379786"
"6352","More a movie that you appreciate and ponder than one you embrace and enjoy. Whatever its intellectual pretensions, I am looking forward to never seeing it again.","50","3464902"
"6353","The picture is smothered by solemn right-mindedness, and hobbled by scripter David McKenna's simplistic, knee-jerk liberal take on suburban white racism.","50","120586"
"6354","All over this movie there are cliches that are just plain embarrassing, and unsettling moments in which it's obvious Kloves is writing about stuff he doesn't know a thing about. [13 Oct 1989, p.E1]","50","97322"
"6355","Despite the ambitious scope of its premise, this confounding, disappointing and, in the end, depressing movie is content to devote 80 percent of its screen time to wondering who gets to kiss the girl.","50","1058017"
"6356","The spirit of Hustlers is so insistently affirmative and celebratory that all kinds of interesting matters are left unexplored.","50","5503686"
"6357","The result is that Revolutionary Road is a hard movie to love. Plenty of people will appreciate the hopelessness, but they might wish for a little less emptiness.","50","959337"
"6358","Even if I could muster the strength to defy studio marching orders on plot details, there is no point. There is little in Endgame that is worth spoiling, given how its core is spoiled rotten to begin with.","50","4154796"
"6359","Denzel Washington does a cocksure turn in Training Day -- That may be enough to transform a shallow picture with delusions of grandeur into a crowd-pleasing hit.","50","139654"
"6360","Despite an excellent and promising cast, this Hollywood attempt at a mainstream feminist comedy is flabby and bland...Complacent, and even worse, not very funny, despite the efforts of the ever-excellent Tomlin.","50","80319"
"6361","It's a clever premise but not one that lends itself to an hour and 42 minutes of high jinks. You get the joke quickly.","50","177789"
"6362","It's the picture's lack of focus that eventually diminishes whatever little The Bling Ring has to say.","50","2132285"
"6363","Game 6 is ultimately a curious dud.","50","425055"
"6364","A harmless celebration of idiocy that is the cinematic equivalent of an overeager, block-headed puppy chasing its tail.","50","329028"
"6365","Wilson and Beckinsale, as the couple on the rocks, do their damnedest to go along for the creepfest, but nothing in Vacancy manages to come anywhere close to the quiet and steadily mounting dread of the real thing, much less the purview of Norman Bates or his beloved mother.","50","452702"
"6366","All that starring talent isn’t exactly wasted here; it’s just diluted, watered down enough to demote “really funny” to sort of funny, now and then, here and there, some of the time. Hey, it’s the movie biz.","50","1279935"
"6367","It's harmless. And pointless. And dumb. This is a perfect example of a motion picture that exists exclusively because its predecessor made a lot of money.","50","1078912"
"6368","It's impressive enough to look at, and the voice talent – especially Black and Hoffman - doesn't disappoint, but all the CGI wankery and high-end talent only barely allows Kung Fu Panda to rise above cliché.","50","441773"
"6369","There are laughs here, but easily as many groans.","50","240900"
"6370","For better or worse, Vanilla Sky is a genuine, albeit jejune, statement of star consciousness -- blustery with self-awe and feverish with cataclysmic self-doubt.","50","259711"
"6371","Escape from L.A. is too preposterous to be a good film. But in keeping with its title, it does provide a couple of hours of entertaining escapism. [12 Aug 1996, p.C1]","50","116225"
"6372","This romantic farce has a talented cast and energy to spare, but somehow the ingredients don't burn as brightly as one would expect from such promising ingredients.","50","138097"
"6373","As a form of wish fulfillment, it’s fascinating if unpersuasive; as a vision of its subject—high-school life—it’s as faux-sweet and faux-innocent as the films of the Frankie Avalon era.","50","1489887"
"6374","There isn't much to recommend this movie until Pacino and De Niro finally share the first of their two scenes together.","50","113277"
"6375","This is one of those ""Crash""-style pictures with interwoven narrative strands. The problem here is that most of the strands wind up little more than loose ends.","50","865554"
"6376","The movie's shift into an implausible thriller magnifies its lack of character development. But Gosling gives an impassioned performance throughout.","50","247199"
"6377","This ultra-slick, fantasy-inducing visit to an international wonder world of wealth and deception plays more like an inventory of thieving and gambling techniques than a captivating diversion, even if it's hard not to be voyeuristically pulled in by some of its ruses.","50","2381941"
"6378","Perhaps the constant hunt for hemoglobin is slowing our villain down, for this time there are strong indications that the once gory plot is showing definite signs of anemia.","50","51554"
"6379","All four actors are perfectly fine here, but the set-up is predictably conventional.","50","6212478"
"6380","As much as film buffs might enjoy recognizing references to ""Motel Hell"" and other drive-in classics, Mr. Zombie's encyclopedic approach to the genre results in a crowded, frenzied film in which no single idea is developed to a satisfying payoff.","50","251736"
"6381","Heading for the jungles in her high heels, Turner is like a lot of unwitting screen heroines ahead of her, guaranteed that her drab existence is about to be transformed – probably by a man, preferably handsome and adventurous. Sure enough, Michael Douglas pops out of the jungle. The expected complications are supplied by the kidnappers, Danny DeVito and Zack Norman.","50","88011"
"6382","An exercise in competence guaranteed neither to offend the initiated nor to charm anyone else.","50","449010"
"6383","Like a skill player who just can't score, The Damned United is all dazzle and no finish and, ultimately, damned frustrating.","50","1226271"
"6384","Jaws 2 isn't a disgraceful self-imitation, but one sampling should be enough. It may inspire nothing so much as a nostalgic hunger to see ""Jaws"" again.","50","77766"
"6385","Rose resorts too easily to the easy jolt, the gratuitous release of anxiety and, finally, the reliance on graphic bloodletting and pointless shocks (such as the ominously unsettling Todd kissing Madsen with a mouthful of bees), sacrificing whatever substance the story started out with. [17 Oct 1992, p.C5]","50","103919"
"6386","Legend is a fairytale produced on a grand scale, set in some timeless world and peopled with fairies, elves and goblins, plus a spectacularly satisfying Satan. At the same time, the basic premise is alarmingly thin, a compendium of any number of ancient fairytales.","50","89469"
"6387","Unfortunately, I Think We’re Alone Now stops being interesting right when Grace (Elle Fanning) comes to town, mostly because she brings screenwriter Mike Makowsky’s trite ideas about loneliness and community along with her.","50","6169694"
"6388","The film arrives at its last shot with a sense of purpose, but Cedar’s clumsy plotting and uncharacteristically sterile compositions suggest that he’s charted the least enjoyable route to the film’s satisfying finale.","50","4191702"
"6389","The Little Mermaid is the story of one packrat pre-tween princess whose undersea kingdom is only matched in depth by her remarkable sense of consumer-minded entitlement.","50","97757"
"6390","Along with screenwriters Robert Schenkkan and Andrew Knight, Gibson, whose lack of directorial subtlety but skill with action both reach an apex here, is not content to tell the true story of Desmond Doss and his unshakeable, courage-giving faith. He wants to convince us that his faith was, in fact, the truth.","50","2119532"
"6391","Rob Marshall simply cuts from one tale to the next, isolating his actors. There's little sense that the fairytale space is a shared one -- it's just a bunch of noisy incident transpiring in unrelated treestands.","50","2180411"
"6392","Though the charter of the Enterprise charges its crew to ""go boldly where no man has gone before,"" the marketing strategy of Paramount Pictures clearly mandates that the film go quietly in a predictable fashion to a place where the mass audience will feel comfortable. This Star Trek II does, with its familiar faces and lovable homilies. The film seems bound to be one of the summer's big hits. Kids will love it, and dozing adults will at least find it endurable. [5 June 1985, p.C4]","50","84726"
"6393","Shallow and proud of it, an antic cartoon that lacks the comic inspiration to go the distance.","50","887883"
"6394","It is a daring thing the director has done, this bleaching out of all the cheap thrills, this dashing of all the hopes one brings to what is, after all, advertised as ""a masterpiece of modern horror."" Certainly he has asked much of Nicholson, who must sustain attention in a hugely unsympathetic role, and who responds with a brilliantly crazed performance.","50","81505"
"6395","It's great to look at, nearly giddy with pop-culture love, and its particulars are intriguing. But those pieces — by turns weird, soulful and exhilarating — merely accumulate, when they should be generating magic.","50","6628394"
"6396","All the imagination and effort (including 18 months of pre-production) that went into making the dinosaurs state-of-the-art exciting apparently left no time to make the people similarly believable or involving. In fact, when the big guys leave the screen, you'll be tempted to leave the theater with them. [11 June 1993, Calendar, p.F-1]","50","107290"
"6397","The plot of Antitrust is intricate and uneven, overloaded with twists and not very jolting surprises.","50","218817"
"6398","It isn't clever. It isn't original. It isn't scary. At best, Skyline is a proficient, forgettable programmer that only occasionally lapses into irredeemably silliness.","50","1564585"
"6399","It is rare that a movie finds its way into the hearts of a massive audience with both flair and sentimentality that made the 1949 ""Little Women"" so unique and unforgettable. The new one pretty much settles for sentimentality.","50","3281548"
"6400","This time, the results are only fair. [13 Jan 1989, p.5G]","50","97179"
"6401","Alternately enrapturing and exhausting, brilliant and glib, this is a ""Romeo and Juliet"" more for the eyes than the ears. [4 Nov 1996, pg.73]","50","117509"
"6402","Anderson almost brings off a picture worthy of his grandiose ambition.","50","469494"
"6403","In making The Matrix's leaden answer to ""The Phantom Menace,"" the Wachowski brothers seem to be afflicted with George Lucas Syndrome: They're so enthralled by the convoluted mythology of their own private universe that they've lost touch with its human core.","50","234215"
"6404","Payback may not always be P.C., but it's not interested in making friends, anyway. Just killing enemies.","50","120784"
"6405","Hard to Kill is all Seagal, and if pure action thrills are your preference, this will do just fine. [13 Feb 1990, p.C7]","50","99739"
"6406","Embracing outraged victimhood the way Angelina Jolie embraces a close-up, Ms. Basinger, doing double duty here as an executive producer, appears oblivious to the script's idiocies.","50","887971"
"6407","It's all a little too polished, a little too smug to be ranked up there as one of the great journalism films.","50","140352"
"6408","A relentlessly formulaic biopic that succeeds at transforming one of the most compelling sports narratives of the 20th century into a home run of hagiography.","50","453562"
"6409","The movie's script and production values represent a big step up from the nearly unwatchable predecessor and make it suitable viewing even for people who aren't Twilight nerds.","50","1259571"
"6410","The Naked Gun 33 1/3 has the feel of a movie with too many jokes off the cutting-room floor. Through it all, Nielsen's consummate timing and ability to come through in the klutz makes things seem more amusing than they are. [18 Mar 1994, p.3]","50","110622"
"6411","Adheres to the whacked notion that Hollywood does drugs so the rest of us don't have to.","50","235737"
"6412","The 32-year-old carnivorous fish franchise has lost none of its bite, serving up a fresh batch of spring-break revelers for the fearsome creatures to attack.","50","464154"
"6413","The plots are fairly basic, but the direction by John Carpenter and Tobe Hooper is droll, the effects are all a fan could ask for, and the playing is appropriately agitated. [06 Aug 1993, p.D15]","50","106449"
"6414","A bit embalmed in its own nobility, it’s an extraordinary story told in dutiful, unexceptional terms, the passionate commitment of all involved rarely achieving gut-level impact.","50","1809398"
"6415","The message here is clear: You can’t front to your true friends. This clique is ready to take on the world, and they aren’t afraid to fight dirty for each other. What can I say? Squad goals.","50","3564472"
"6416","I can't pretend that the third episode instilled a fever in my blood, but it didn't leave me cold. For the first time in the series I felt I'd seen a real movie.","50","1325004"
"6417","Adept at wringing maximum suspense and might have reached the heights of the Korean monster film ""The Host"" but for the limitations of the camcorder ploy. While it injects the film with a run-and-gun urgency, the device grows tiresome and ultimately leaves the film shortchanged.","50","1060277"
"6418","If “The Lobster” remains Lanthimos’s most vital work, that’s because it tempers the gloom with a mischievous play of wit. The Killing of a Sacred Deer, by contrast, is stubbornly hard to enjoy; there are jokes, but they make few dents in the programmatic rigor of the plot.","50","5715874"
"6419","Patricia Clarkson is kind of funny as Jamie's mom, an unreformed hippie. And Timberlake and Kunis get in a few good laughs before it's over. But with such a well-worn story, you can't shake the idea you've seen this kind of thing before.","50","1632708"
"6420","The satire is crammed with sexual and scatological humor; some may find this Rabelaisian and refreshing, while others will detect the end of civilization as we know it.","50","145660"
"6421","Paul Haggis' middling fourth feature evinces a sometimes pulse-quickening fascination with procedural details, and climaxes with a good dose of swift, suspenseful filmmaking. But what was briskly diverting in the original has been rather laboriously overworked.","50","1458175"
"6422","Meet Joe Black, with Brad Pitt, is a near-death experience: Time seems to stop as we stiffen in our seats and the actors all whisper as if they're at a wake.","50","119643"
"6423","Ms. Williams tries her best, and sometimes that's almost enough.","50","1655420"
"6424","For everything the movie gets right--most notably the impressively pared-down script by Joe Penhall and the two truthful and fearless performances from Mortensen and McPhee--there's a corresponding painful blunder, like the overwrought score from Nick Cave.","50","898367"
"6425","Battle looks like the last gap of a dying series, a movie made simply to wring the dollars out of any remaining ape fans.","50","69768"
"6426","It isn't a comedy - it's a sluggish adventure movie about an L.A.-to-Chicago train trip that wastes two considerable talents. [13 Dec 1976, p.106A]","50","75223"
"6427","Single White Female is simply Fatal Attraction or Final Analysis in a new locale. Superbly crafted, yet unremittingly violent, it's the cinematic equivalent of being bludgeoned for two hours. [14 Aug 1992, p.21]","50","105414"
"6428","It's got a few things going for it and it's not unenjoyable to sit through, but, at the same time, the tone and creative register never feel confident and settled. It's not bad but not quite good enough either.","50","1638355"
"6429","Every scene is on the prowl for laughs at the expense of the inherent drama in the lives of its colorful characters.","50","1583420"
"6430","A film that begins with a train wreck and then, figuratively speaking, becomes one.","50","217869"
"6431","Connery and Boyle are fine, but the wholesale lifting of High Noon's plot (there's even an on-screen digital readout periodically displayed, counting down the minutes until the big confrontation) certainly undermines interest.","50","82869"
"6432","It all adds up to an entertaining combination of suspense and melodrama, a movie that doesn't cohere too well - and veers toward the silly in its more-obvious plot mechanics.","50","913425"
"6433","While Last of the Mohicans is an eyeful - how could anything shot in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina not be? - it's mindless, meticulous in its externals, taking refuge from awareness by clinging to Cooper's distortions. In the end, it'll be remembered for its three S's: Stowe, Studi and the scenery. [25 Sep 1992, p.27]","50","104691"
"6434","Machine Gun Preacher is the umpteenth onscreen iteration of a white savior aiding the most desperate in Africa.","50","1586752"
"6435","Dazzlingly designed and staged in a theatrical setting so as to suggest that the characters are enacting assigned roles in life, this tight and pacy telling of a 900 page-plus novel touches a number of its important bases but lacks emotional depth, moral resonance and the simple ability to allow its rich characters to experience and drink deeply of life.","50","1781769"
"6436","Eastern Promises is intensely anti-dramatic.","50","765443"
"6437","Alas, Brick, from writer-director Rian Johnson, isn't as clever as its conceit.","50","393109"
"6438","Really, Young Victoria is just a lot of costumes in fond search of some drama. And finding precious little.","50","962736"
"6439","Amid all the important facts, I longed for something unnecessary from the filmmaker, some expressive flourish whose sole purpose isn’t just to convey information. Again I find myself typing the words, “It’s an unquestionably worthy story, I just wish it was told with more inventiveness.”","50","4882376"
"6440","For all the movie's coarse grandeur -- for all the blood in its battle scenes and the grim historical accuracy of its depiction of antediluvian medical procedures -- the story of Master and Commander feels like something intended not for adults but for children.","50","311113"
"6441","Admirers of their MTV series will find a few laughs in this animated odyssey. Others will find it as repetitious as it is vulgar.","50","115641"
"6442","For In Bruges to click, McDonagh needed either to get more real or more fake.","50","780536"
"6443","Director Irwin Winkler (Night and the City)is rarely better than pedestrian in handling this story. At worst, the dramatic elements are plain clumsy.","50","132512"
"6444","In a better world, Aquaman would excel at delivering an ecological message to the masses. But all the fish in the sea can’t salvage a movie that refuses to go more than surface deep.","50","1477834"
"6445","Wheatley's riotous Looney Tunes action comedy is a sporadically amusing assault on the senses, but it looks like it was more fun to make than to watch.","50","4158096"
"6446","Stallone directs a bloodbath that borrows liberally from such male-bonding classics as Robert Aldrich's ""The Dirty Dozen"" and Sam Peckinpah's ""The Wild Bunch,"" but offers not a whiff of the tragic fatalism and astute critique of machismo that inform those superior dramas.","50","1320253"
"6447","The story has the hollow ring of artifice, even though Ms. Hawkins shrinks quite remarkably into the physical aspects of the role and opens up its spiritual dimensions.","50","3721954"
"6448","The crime story, involving the hunt for the men who murdered this girl, is strictly by-the-numbers (and there are a few clue that still don’t fit together in my mind) but Sheridan proves himself a surprisingly effective director of action.","50","5362988"
"6449","This intermittently effective UK horror thriller carefully establishes the psychological relationships among the women, then squanders this calibrated and generally plausible setup with a series of crude, implausible, and scattershot horror effects.","50","435625"
"6450","A movie that moves slower than it should and that keeps us detached for long periods of time. Most of the problems can be traced to the script, which does a poor job of establishing the characters and giving us a sense of how they relate to each other.","50","1488606"
"6451","True to Hollywood's tireless efforts to fit square-peg material into roundish genre niches, this wavering, intermittently smart story of daring to think differently flattens its narrative into formula.","50","1210166"
"6452","While I have no doubt that Jaws will make a bloody fortune for Universal and producers Richard Zanuck and David Brown, it is a coarse-grained and exploitive work which depends on excess for its impact. Ashore it is a bore, awkwardly staged and lumpily written.","50","73195"
"6453","Although the humor helps, the Groundhog Day-like repetition gets tedious; it makes you feel more like a hamster than a groundhog — or rather a hamster's wheel, going round and round, over and over again.","50","1631867"
"6454","When the haze wears off and the movie grounds itself in reality, it's a bummer. Until then, though, what's weird here is gloriously weird.","50","1234548"
"6455","On all fronts, it strives to twist the Robin Hood story into something more provocative, but ultimately it’s a garbled, hollow mess of attempts at relevancy.","50","4532826"
"6456","Sitting through the accomplished but meaningless Black Hawk Down is like being trapped in an action film version of ""Groundhog Day,"" condemned to sit through the same carnage over and over.","50","265086"
"6457","So much effort seems to have gone into the eye-popping production design, swooping camera work and anachronistic musical score that the result is hyper-active cacophony rather than enthralling entertainment.","50","1343092"

"6462","All the genre elements play like an afterthought, and that's frustrating because the rest of the movie isn't quite spry enough to stay interesting without action, adventure, or at least little more weirdness.","51","6017942"
"6463","While The Interview never slacks in its mission to tell jokes, it's such a messy and meandering movie that it never quite lands as a satire of politics or the media or anything else.","52","2788710"
"6464","Even Besson’s most bold choices – and this is a film that goes weird, and then just keeps getting weirder – don’t seem so revolutionary when packaged in such well-tread trappings and increasingly shoddy writing.","52","2872732"
"6465","It dresses up boilerplate horror in a classy shell, yet never gives it the pulse it needs.","52","838247"
"6466","The film isn’t especially scary, but it has a creepy, pervasive grimness, well-acted by the impressive ensemble.","52","3612126"
"6467","The movie looks a little like a lost Tony Scott project, but not quite enough — the style isn’t as tactile. Most of its ridiculous conviction comes from Diesel. He’s given plenty of better performances, but here he’s especially convincing in the role of a guy who legitimately believes he has nothing better to do.","52","1634106"
"6468","Jurassic World never works all that hard to wow us, either with groundbreaking effects or with a story that remotely holds our attention.","52","369610"

"6470","It's a lock to pile up the honors during Hollywood's annual awards season next spring (at the Golden Raspberries and the MTV Movie Awards).","53","185183"
"6471","Badly photographed, clumsily edited, and lacking any discernable cinematic style.","54","171580"
"6472","When Stanton lets the film be pure popcorn entertainment, with swashbuckling set pieces and lovably corny romanticism, it's a great ride in the Indiana Jones tradition.","55","401729"
"6473","The tragedy of The Fighter is that Wahlberg's performance suggests a character who wants more. And yet Russell barely seems to notice how much subtlety Wahlberg brings to his role, or to the movie at large.","55","964517"
"6474","The plot of Cars 2 is both overly convoluted and thin, and it folds in so much unvarnished toddler-instruction that it almost feels like an educational film.","55","1216475"
"6475","Many of the White House scenes are jarringly motley, as Whitaker maintains Gaines' dignity against a series of performances that range from bland (James Marsden's JFK) to cartoonish (Liev Schreiber's LBJ). It comes as a relief when Daniels reduces Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford to TV clips — though that strategy makes the film even more of a stylistic jumble.","55","1327773"
"6476","It's populated by characters who are just too good to be plausible.","55","1659337"
"6477","Audiences in the mood to be scared will certainly send their popcorn flying during a few tense moments of The Meg. But they’ll also wish the movie had bothered to find an equivalent to Robert Shaw’s USS Indianapolis speech in “Jaws.” When the human characters are reduced to chum, it’s hard to care about them getting eaten.","55","4779682"
"6478","The puffy high tones of medieval fantasy punctured by the flatly vulgar and colloquial - is the film's central comic vein, one McBride taps it like it's never been tapped before.","55","1240982"
"6479","In its quietest scenes, Mid90s feels a little more authentic, and Hill may well turn out to have a growing talent for directing. But he needs to match his subtler insights to a script that feels less derivative.","55","5613484"

"6481","The original was a little sharper, with actual satirical swipes at modern British life. The remake replaces some of that material with lazy pop-culture gags, most of them specifically African-American.","55","1321509"

"6483","It occasionally reminds you of how awful it can be a kid, and It also occasionally makes you jump out of your chair. But it never figures out how to do both at the same time.","55","1396484"
"6484","How, I'm wondering more and more often, do studios put movies like this one in front of audiences and assume they'll just buy it? The secret to making a great, or even just a good, thriller these days seems to have been lost.","55","1219289"
"6485","The broadness of Phoenix’s work allows the rest of the ensemble — particularly Conroy, Zazie Beetz as a single-mom neighbor, and MVP character actors like Bill Camp, Shea Whigham and Brian Tyree Henry — to dial it down and give effectively human-size performances.","55","7286456"
"6486","Based on Garrard Conley’s 2016 memoir, Boy Erased is a methodical work that tries to account for the horrors of religious conversion camps as soberly as possible—but unfortunately to the point where soberness edges into blandness.","55","7008872"

"6488","Since the genre of video games-turned-into-feature films has inflicted some real doozies on audiences, Tomb Raider towers above most of its peers by being merely OK. By any other measure, this is a saga of fits and starts, and we can only hope for smoother sailing if the film inspires the sequels it clearly hopes to engender.","55","1365519"

"6495","There’s plenty of grisly stuff here, and a lot of it is done practically, which might entice some gorehounds. But that can only go so far. Pesce’s The Eyes of My Mother has ten times less gore than this and still managed to be ten times as scary. Here’s hoping he gets back to making something like that, and soon.","55","3612126"
"6496","It’s hard to say Game Night is entirely bad. I laughed a lot and its creators are clearly capable of crafting a joke. Yet they seem to have either an incomplete or an incredibly cynical conception of what a movie is.","55","2704998"
"6497","Sheer force of personality is the main ingredient of any great sports movie, and Pugh has enough of it to pull the story along. But this is a star performance that deserved an equally dazzling script.","55","6513120"
"6498","Rather than take the time to let us really get to know and understand its complicated title character, the movie instead goes for cheap, gotcha plotting that undermines the entire project.","55","4540710"
"6499","That face-off between two comics legends becomes but one in a series of big things bashing into other big things, which is what Snyder and writers Chris Terrio and David S.

The trio do manage to cough up an acceptable number of ooh-that’s-cool moments, and fans who will be satisfied with those will be satisfied with those, but any other ideas and characters the movie might offer get lost in the rubble.","55","2975590"

"6501","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile has some interesting ideas about how little we know the people we love, and about the power of a celebrity cult status.

"6502","Unlike the tale told in ""Precious"", however, The Blind Side's story is contrived, storybook sweet, credulity-straining and ... um, true.","55","878804"

"6504","This is design work of the highest caliber and it is impossible to not enjoy simply watching these little buggers run around. It is unfortunate, however, that the creativity, originality and propulsive storytelling found in the original “Monsters Inc.” just didn’t matriculate with them.","55","1453405"

"6507","The Descendants is an ultra-polished picture in which every emotion we're supposed to feel has been cued up well in advance. There's nothing surprising or affecting about it. Not even Clooney, who works wonders with the occasional piece of dialogue, can save it.","55","1033575"

"6510","It may seem odd for a teen-focused action movie to feel so glum, but that's actually something that the director gets right, even if it threatens to make this a dull affair: Ender's Game is a dark story of a children's crusade built on the crushed psyches of damaged youths, and too much uplift would undermine it.","55","1731141"
"6511","As Lily Tomlin's Ernestine once said, ""There's nothing like a Hoover when you're dealing with dirt."" Clint Eastwood's J. Edgar could use more dirt: This is a sensitive, sympathetic portrait of a scummy little man.","55","1616195"
"6512","Watching these two actors move from being sweetly flirtatious to doing real emotional battle may not entirely compensate for the movie's other failings, but it goes a long way toward making amends.","55","1632708"
"6513","Appropriate to its teenage milieu, Alfonso Gomez-Rejon‘s breakthrough film isn’t unlike spending a couple of hours with an exceptionally witty high-schooler: It’s entertaining as hell, but you can’t help rolling your eyes a little at its self-satisfied pseudo-profundities.","55","2582496"
"6514","It's a little unfair to any sequel to use its predecessor as a yardstick rather than considering it on its own merit, but in this case, it's impossible to put the original movie aside. Not just because of the title, but because Sword Of Destiny mimics its predecessor in so many clear and frustrating ways.","56","2652118"
"6515","Taylor’s film so egregiously picks and chooses from Brown’s life that the result is a holey and unsatisfying document that fails to give due respect to much of the singer’s life (especially the more unsavory stuff).","56","2473602"
"6516","Bahrani (and co-writer Amir Naderi) want the audience to go to the dark side with them without losing their faith in the system. To anyone who has watched this crisis unfold over the last decade, it will feel like a cheat.","57","2891174"
"6517","A directorial debut composed of many of the filmmaker’s trademarks (strong women, pop cultural-heavy dialogue, a difficult subject matter made light by way of wit) that still manages to disappoint when it comes to the final product.","57","1262990"

"6521","Hyde Park On Hudson once again finds ""Meatballs"" star Bill Murray leading a populist, crowd-pleasing slobs-vs.-snobs comedy, but this time, his role as Roosevelt reflects his status as a silver-haired heavyweight thespian.","58","1477855"
"6522","No wonder Green Book, which is like an inverted ""Driving Miss Daisy"" by way of ""Rain Man’s"" mismatched-buddy road trip, is already earning ovations: Intentionally or not, it flatters the delusion that racism, in its ugliest form, is more of a past-tense problem.","58","6966692"

"6525","Fortunately, Winkler has a good cast.","58","264796"
"6526","The first of two sequels shot in immediate succession, Dead Man's Chest bears the unenviable burden of racking the pins for both movies, which leaves it with precious few opportunities to have a little fun of its own.","58","383574"
"6527","Couldn't Mike Judge, with his acid wit, have come up with a better title for a suburban-schlub comedy than ?Extract?","58","1225822"
"6528","I didn't mind The Terminal, but I didn't really buy it, either. Spielberg has crafted the film with a proficiency as seamless, and impersonal, as the setting, and you may feel, after a while, that you're longing for your departure time.","58","362227"
"6529","Although the filmmakers reportedly worked with David Copperfield and other renowned real-life illusionists and tried to minimize the use of CGI, you're still left wondering how much of the magic is merely the kind Hollywood spits out by the terabyte.","58","1670345"
"6530","The subject matter is immediate and engaging. But the structure of this film is languid to the point of aggravation.","58","4353250"

"6534","Too much of this movie, directed by Peter Ramsey, is more clamorous than inspired, and little kids might find parts of it too scarily intense.","58","1446192"
"6535","As the film builds toward a ludicrous finale, it poses a question: Foster is a far better actor than Charles Bronson, and Jordan a much better director than Michael Winner, so why is The Brave One so much less satisfying than ""Death Wish""?","58","476964"
"6536","As it progresses it becomes a sloppy mix of modern and antique, and the limits of its lead actors and its script become evident.","58","375154"
"6537","Judging by the title, though, Sprecher made the movie she wanted to make, and if you're in the right damp-wool mood, you may connect with it too.","58","268690"
"6538","Kubo and the Two Strings is lovely to behold, if viewers manage to keep their eyes open. It's an animated doozy and drowser at once, an uncomfortable mix of Miyazaki-style imagination and generic dullness.","58","4302938"
"6539","The laughs don't linger, even within individual scenes. What remains, reinforced by a set of end-credit outtakes, is the sense that Sudeikis, Day, Bateman, and Pine had a really good time making a sort of okay movie.","58","2170439"
"6540","What’s the point in shooting a horror movie in the catacombs if it’s just going to end up looking like every horror movie not shot in the catacombs?","58","2870612"
"6541","While [Lawrence] does robust, heartfelt work in the lead in his new film Joy, this is the most miscast she's been in a while, and it's such a strangely imagined film in the first place that it never really gets its bearings.","58","2446980"
"6542","When the military brass warns that ""we're about to be colonized,"" you wonder if they mean to shut down the borders. It's probably not coincidental that the film is replete with Latino actors, or that one of the prime subplots involves a Hispanic father trapped behind enemy lines with his young son.","58","1217613"

"6545","One dramatic ploy that doesn't work is the casting of Demi Moore as Tracy Edward, a homicide detective intent on capturing the Thumbprint Killer. Moore gave a rare good performance as the washed up diva in ""Bobby,"" but her stridency here is grating.","58","780571"
"6546","Exists for one purpose, and one purpose only: to further the entertainment careers of Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. It's like an Elvis movie for 'tweenagers. That doesn't make the film uninteresting as a pop confection.","58","363282"
"6547","Director Martin Campbell and a quartet of screenwriters dump in everything from the rise of the Confederacy to the development of Weapons of Mass Destruction. What escapes them is the cool, clear line of action that would enable Banderas and Zeta-Jones to flaunt their amorous charms without huffing and puffing and stretch their swashbuckling muscles with dash, not balderdash.","58","386140"
"6548","Lee Daniels’ The Butler could be an important film that comes at a time where race is still a challenging topic for America, but it succeeds less as a film than as a history lesson.","58","1327773"

"6550","Abandoning its more original elements, the movie opts for a banal carpe diem conceit that turns Mitty into a globetrotting bystander.","58","359950"
"6551","Where Imitation Game ultimately falters is in tackling Turing's later years and subsequent demise. In some ways, this period is meant to bookend the film, but instead just leaves unanswered questions while diminishing actual historical events.","58","2084970"
"6552","What really hurts the film is its messy screenplay and boilerplate direction.","58","1967614"
"6553","The first two — The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons — left much to be desired. This one emerges as a marked improvement, though that’s not saying a whole lot.","58","3062096"
"6554","Lee's performance is by far the best thing about The Crow. Unfortunately, he's just good enough to make you wish that the movie had had a whisper of storytelling invention to go along with its showy visual design.","58","109506"

"6556","Blunt-witted, visually pedestrian, and overly long, with too many scenes of Blade and his cohorts standing around in darkened corridors, waiting for their enemies to show up. The action, however, is as throat-grabbing as you want it to be.","58","359013"
"6557","Its a stupid thrill for a while, but the high wears off, and the anything-goes approach gets headache-inducing.","58","479884"
"6558","So sloppily and unabashedly sentimental that it can make you laugh and cry at the same time -- and often at the same things.","58","166943"
"6559","Dave McCary’s directorial debut is a film of imagination, adventure, and discovery, but also one too hesitant to challenge in its tone, traveling down a tiresome path of tropes.","58","5805752"
"6560","It isn’t exactly good, but for audiences in search of nothing more than a few silly chuckles, it should prove good enough.","58","1470023"
"6561","Spielberg has filmed Empire of the Sun with great care, paying keen attention to every detail of its time and place. If the film ultimately seems flat and superficial, it's because Spielberg just isn't the right filmmaker for this kind of tough historical subject. [9 Dec 1987, p.21]","58","92965"

"6570","You've already seen this movie, right? Just a few months ago. It was called ""The Score.""","58","252503"
"6571","It's a strange, uneven film, hilarious in moments and tin-eared in others, alternately subtle and hammer-handed, acid and dull, as schizophrenic as ""Signs"" and probably, like that film, best enjoyed in discrete chunks rather than as a whole that needs to be digested equally all at once.","58","258153"
"6572","It's one big miss.","58","448134"
"6573","The crudeness with which Mottola made ""Superbad"" suited that film; here, a similarly rudimentary technique detracts and distracts.","58","1092026"
"6574","By virtue of its style and high stakes scenario, End of Watch is impressively tense, but then so are most episodes of ""COPS,"" which don't suffer from the forced melodrama found here.","58","1855199"
"6575","The real soullessness here is built into the production, a polished adaptation of Hong Kong-style filmmaking that, with its cast of depressive characters, allows for little Hong Kong-style joy.","58","133093"
"6576","The movie's problem is that it's a cartoon, offering no emotional involvement with its characters and no dramatic imperative.","58","120891"
"6577","Christmas has some good points going for it (e.g., Plummer’s grumpy, rascally Scrooge, who’d be great in a straight adaptation), but its portrayal of Dickens’ biography and family life is resoundingly dull, apart from some tense notes in Pryce’s performance.","58","6225520"

"6584","Scene by scene, Batman Returns is more outrageous, inventive and fun than the original Batman. Yet, by its apocalyptic ending, Batman Returns is in danger of collapsing under its own weight. [19 June 1992, p.22]","58","103776"
"6585","It might have helped had the film included a few more representatives of the straight world. As it is, there’s almost nothing for the family to play off. We’re shut up in that mansion right along with them, and the kookiness grows fatally quaint.","58","101272"
"6586","Apart from its impressive (though partially digital) recreation of the Sistine Chapel, The Two Popes offers little in the way of purely cinematic pleasures, relying almost exclusively on the expert parrying of Hopkins and Pryce.","58","8404614"
"6587","It's not the most complex WWII movie you'll see, but there's no denying the blunt intensity of Fury, and even if it doesn't sustain, Ayer commits to staring straight into hellish eye of war and bringing audiences along to witness every gruesome detail.","58","2713180"
"6588","When focused on the natural world and the internal thoughts of its characters, Noah positively crackles with the energy of a filmmaker inspired by a new perspective on classic material... But the latter half of the film, turgid and hamfisted throughout, cripples the film so severely that it makes one thankful for the added elements to Noah’s story.","58","1959490"

"6592","Baruchel aside, The Sorcerer's Apprentice contains a few minor delights. One is Cage's surprisingly low-key approach to a role that he could be expected to play over the top.","58","963966"
"6593","The film’s bent towards revisionist superhero history is certainly compelling, but stuck in the confines of the horror genre, it flames out far more than it flies.","58","7752126"

"6595","Sometimes complicated, sometimes incredibly simple, the film explicates or fawns over the human condition with occasional charm and poignancy but too often it's just cloying.","58","314331"
"6596","If you're one of those fussy filmgoers who demands that a movie engage somewhat higher body parts -- the heart, say, and the brain -- you'll find only intermittent comfort and joy in this high-concept, low-wattage film.","58","319343"
"6597","The bone-crunching action and relentlessly blood-letting feels out of place, and as those sequences start appearing with more frequency, the film loses much of its rangy charm.","58","3316948"
"6598","The chief thing he (Susser) has going for him is Gordon-Levitt, whose intense immersion in his overwritten character is laudable if the result isn't exactly likeable.","58","1403177"
"6599","When even momentary flourishes of action this good remind us how poorly filmed and choreographed most modern action films are, it is hard not to recommend Atomic Blonde on that basis alone.","58","2406566"
"6600","Superficially exciting and handled with great aplomb. But the film is running to go nowhere.","58","993842"
"6601","The characters of Rachel and Nick are charming but their relationship feels backgrounded by numbing amounts of money porn, stilted melodrama, and often-strained comedy.","58","3104988"
"6602","As much as the suspense remains in play, its main threat has a certain robotic quality, and the humorless tone doesn’t help.","58","8364368"
"6603","In emphasizing how art allows us to make sense of the past, and consecrate even the most banal of sins, Von Donnersmarck loses his grip on the emotional payoff of the present.","58","5311542"
"6604","The movie depends on one of those big surprise endings for its effectiveness, but the script gives itself away in the first act.","58","289992"
"6605","A splattery futuristic zombie thriller, designed as a jolt-a-minute freakout for young audiences who were numbed into submission long ago.","58","120804"
"6606","The casting of Jones as Ginsburg might have seemed like a good idea, but, as fine an actress as she is, she can’t quite manage to bring the future Supreme Court justice to life, perhaps because it’s tough to animate cardboard. She’s stiff and humorless.","58","4669788"
"6607","There’s a creepy subtext to all this, especially when Tim uses his time-travel gifts to woo an American girl without her assent.","58","2194499"
"6608","When it's dull, which it is too often for a kidnap caper, this movie is about a woman chirping ''notice anything new about my outfit?'' to a man whose idea of style is a jacket not crusted in human blood.","58","228750"
"6609","By the end, most moviegoers are liable to see it as much ado about nothing.","58","108149"
"6610","Shyamalan’s sensibility may not be enough to turn After Earth into a great (or even very good) film, but it does yield interesting — and at times strikingly realized — results.","58","1815862"
"6611","Natalie Portman, by the way, is fierce and funny as a babe warrior the brothers meet along the way. She's good with dirty words, too.","58","1240982"
"6612","Lucy in the Sky’s attempt to sync cosmological visions with a believable human drama never quite works.","58","4682804"
"6613","A fairly hypocritical exercise -- and one that's so flamboyant and overbearing that it comes perilously close to being a classic awful.","58","179626"
"6614","Jumanji is cardboard Spielberg, a B-movie scrap heap of spare parts lifted from ""Jurassic Park"" and ""Gremlins"" and ""Back to the Future"".","58","113497"
"6615","The first half-hour of this movie is super-worse, with only some sub-""American Pie"" gags fleshing out the lame-brain plot, but once it gets on the road, there's pleasure to be had.","58","1135985"
"6616","Barker spins grisly fantasy out of sexual obsession, yet his style here couldn’t be less obsessive. It’s cluttered and rather incoherent, as though the trailers to four different horror movies had been spliced together.","58","100260"
"6617","With Elysium, the director proves that he still has one hand on the X-Box controller; maybe he should give the allegories a rest already and just get back in the game.","58","1535108"
"6618","The overall effect is enervating, like a party that grinds on after most of the attendees have either left or passed out. And much like ""Kids,"" the enfant terrible’s breakthrough screenplay, Korine’s film has an unintended moral hysteria, like a warning to parents of what their good girls are doing when they aren’t looking. The message: Keep them locked up. In their bikinis, if necessary.","58","2101441"
"6619","How Do You Know asks really good questions but doesn't so much answer them as toss the ball from player to player until the clock runs out.","58","1341188"
"6620","This is, after all, not just Robert Redford. It's Redford in the nobly burnished self-mythologic perfection of his late-middle-aged golden god-ness.","58","272020"
"6621","Fleck and Boden certainly have strong filmmaking smarts. They understand restraint, have terrific observational eyes, and know how to coax honest performances out of actors. So it’s perhaps a shame that Mississippi Grind is ultimately too underwhelming to stake with any confidence.","58","2349144"
"6622","Well-intentioned but underdeveloped and self-satisfied, it feels at times like the ultimate movie for the millennial generation, or at least its stereotype.","58","1405365"
"6623","Gold is fitfully entertaining, but for a movie that gives itself license to go bigger and weirder than real life, its imagination for excess runs out whenever it isn’t focused intently on its star.","58","1800302"
"6624","The movie is funny when it's nasty, as when Ron and Veronica trade insults at the anchor desk. Most of the time, though, it's not nasty enough.","58","357413"
"6625","It’s a more cynical, and arguably more realistic, depiction of the unique malignancies of fame than this year’s other Oscar-baiting pop musical, ""A Star Is Born."" But ultimately, it’s no more insightful.","58","5960374"
"6626","It's an even more tedious storytelling mess, with a plot so muddled it's impossible to accurately describe, generating zero interest in its characters and grinding on for nearly three endless hours.","58","449088"
"6627","An early contender for the most Weinstein movie of the year, Woman In Gold bends a complicated legal quagmire—heavy on questions of ownership and national responsibility—into a crowd-pleasing David and Goliath story. The title, too generic for Klimt’s masterpiece, suits the movie just fine.","58","2404425"
"6628","Feig goes for the spaghetti method of storytelling: Throw a whole bunch of stuff at the wall and something has got to stick. Only some does, but the good stuff — the really campy, trashy, nutty stuff — is the kind of thing popcorn cinema hasn’t so happily embraced in years.","58","7040874"
"6629","They put the material on lifts - and end up tripping into TV dramedy land.","58","458352"
"6630","This is a film that admires — even awes at — Billie Jean King, but it doesn’t share her commitment to the game. If anything, it has more in common with Riggs than it should, moving with the sluggishness of a player who underestimates their opponent.","58","4622512"
"6631","A movie that’s scary enough to get under your skin, but not scary enough to stay there.","58","3387520"
"6632","When playing into Linklater’s significant strengths as a director of actors, the film is able to entertain and evoke sincere feelings from its audience.","58","6018306"
"6633","Notorious suffers from biopic-itis, that regrettable tendency to reduce complicated lives to a greatest-hits assemblage of melodramatic highs and agonizing lows.","58","472198"
"6634","The movie has its moments, and some are undeniably affecting. But even those seem artificial, relying far too much on our familiarity with and fondness for the film's stars.","58","825232"
"6635","Joe Pesci has more energy than charm in the title role, but the supporting cast has some terrific moments, and the comedy supplies a fair number of laughs before running completely out of steam.","58","104952"
"6636","This may look like the same story, but the soul of it is missing — lost on the way out of the ground.","58","837563"
"6637","The Human Stain is, contradictorily, drained of color by the spotlight turned on its charismatic leads. Between the labors of simplifying the story for the screen and accommodating the stardust of world-class actors, an essentially, uniquely American tragic hero and heroine are bleached of real American tragedy.","58","308383"
"6638","As a work of art, the movie, shot quickly on digital video, is genial enough if unrefined.","58","254099"
"6639","Wan seems to critique the third act failings of The Conjuring during the alarmingly superior first half.","58","1457767"
"6640","Technical elegance and fine performances mask the shallowness of a story as simpleminded as the '50s TV to which it condescends; certainly it's got none of the depth, poignance, and brilliance of ""The Truman Show,"" the recent TV-is-stifling drama that immediately comes to mind.","58","120789"
"6641","I suppose it's asking too much for a great actor to be matched up with a great director on a project like this. On the other hand, there's always the sequel.","58","371746"
"6642","Second Act never recovers from its big reveal, a cataclysmic (and nearly catastrophic) piece of narrative nuttiness that derails every scene, every performance, every subsequent revelation.","58","2126357"
"6643","In spite of how visually dazzling and legitimately entertaining it is, Ready Player One is at its heart, a celebration of the gormless rube. It is a paean to the schmuck. To celebrate it uncritically is to become one.","58","1677720"
"6644","Ultimately, the lack of risk-taking not only makes for a pedantic experience but ironically serves Tubman very poorly, never allowing for Erivo’s performance or the spirit of the subject to ever feel truly free.","58","4648786"
"6645","A fairly underwhelming experience for man or child -- not so much bad as just more of the same, with little of the original's novelty or freshness.","58","413267"
"6646","It’s well crafted and compelling at times thanks mostly to the casts’ efforts, but there is an emptiness that permeates through the film as if a significant piece of Wilde’s demise is missing.","58","2404639"
"6647","Boy's premise reeks of stalker-movie mothballs, and it's too timid to fully dive into the high camp it hints at. Instead, this cookie just crumbles.","58","3181822"
"6648","Vaughn opts for comic-book bigness—big fights, big laugh lines, big explosions—but without a Spider-Man or Batman at the front of the action, Kick-Ass’s heroes and villains look smaller-than-life in a larger-than-life world.","58","1250777"
"6649","Isn't a bad movie so much as one that feels like an amateur version of material from more accomplished works -- a movie that not only isn't sure what it really is but doesn't seem terribly much to care.","58","258463"
"6650","The shooting of the movie-within-a-movie offers the brightest moments in Son Of Rambow, a testament to the innocence of the boys' creative impulse and the sheer unlikely pleasure of their friendship.","58","845046"
"6651","Where Craven and his director, Alexandre Aja, may have miscalculated is in making the genetically damaged demons, with their flesh-potato foreheads and minimal verbal skills, into monster action figures who take vengeance on the world that created them. They're not scary because they're victims themselves.","58","454841"
"6652","Has cheesy effects and a hoary plot, but its macabre, self-deprecating sense of humor makes up for a lot.","58","211443"
"6653","Has a few viciously funny moments.","58","173716"
"6654","Do we really need another Hulk movie? I was one of the few critics who actually liked Ang Lee's 2003 ""Hulk,"" but it didn't exactly ring the cash registers or clamor for a continuation.","58","800080"
"6655","At the end of the day, it’s the action equivalent of a secondhand musical – you’ll most likely come for the dance scenes, and they’re good enough to wade through the filler.","58","6499752"
"6656","It never generates much interest in its story or affection for its characters, and it's simply not half as funny as it needs to be.","58","1032755"
"6657","Reynolds makes Hal a perfectly functional comic-book hero, but there's a big difference between functional and super.","58","1133985"
"6658","Intentionally or not, Denial is perfectly timed to a season of insane conspiracy theories and feelings-based readings of facts.","58","4645330"
"6659","If the two most gorgeous people in the world alternately bantering and making out isn't enough to compel the attention of the average American moviegoer, then we are truly doomed.","58","356910"
"6660","The Black Dahlia has sparks of brilliance, swaths of dark intensity, unpredictable crackles of wit, some solid acting. But it's chiefly flat and ambling and dull, insufficient in musculature and overripe with melodrama.","58","387877"
"6661","If only the script measured up to the craft. La La Land gives us no reason to root for Mia and Seb’s romance, except for its blithe assurance that you will because you loved Stone and Gosling together in Crazy, Stupid, Love.","58","3783958"
"6662","It’s just uninspired, a by-the-books courtroom drama, full of big speeches about justice and equality and Doing What’s Right, moved along by montages and fake-outs.","58","4916630"
"6663","(Bullock's) performance, and the movie's serious side, soon get lost in an overly slick script.","58","191754"
"6664","The film forgets that Bond's most dangerous actions have always been his quietest ones, in which he uses his charisma to turn his enemies against themselves.","58","120347"
"6665","Engaging enough, but its characters’ path to redemption would be more satisfying if it weren’t greased with authentically ’80s-style casual sexism, gay panic, and frat-comedy clichés.","58","1231587"
"6666","As a film whose central theme emphasizes the dangers of living in the past, Wright, Pegg and Frost become fatally distracted by nostalgia, eventually paying too much homage to previous classics—especially their own—to create another film that deserves to stand alongside them.","58","1213663"
"6667","Undoubtedly a trifle, but it's still kind of nice for a summer movie to try charming us instead of just bludgeoning us into submission.","58","1067774"
"6668","Maybe it’s inevitable that the film ends up feeling like an extremely diluted combination of Matsoukas’ two most famous music videos, crossing the political imagery of Beyoncé’s “Formation” with the outlaw imagery of Rihanna’s “We Found Love”—though it’s nowhere as stylish as the former or as sexy as the latter.","58","8722346"
"6669","Calvary becomes a lurid Agatha Christie yarn with something important to say about the church and Ireland that McDonagh can't fully articulate. Pulp keeps getting in the way.","58","2234003"
"6670","St. Vincent goes down easier than it probably should. It helps that Lieberher, though saddled with some cutesy movie-kid dialogue, makes a sweet and empathetic sidekick for Murray (he calls him “sir” constantly, like Marcie in old Peanuts strips), and that McCarthy, like so many gifted comedians, proves capable of playing it straight as needed.","58","2170593"
"6671","A tastefully overbearing franchise fairy tale with a handful of ravishing touches.","58","1735898"
"6672","Starts high, gradually bogs down, then dies.","58","195945"
"6673","This chiller has its predictable and unpredictable moments. As random, brutal murders on film go, Halloween 4 does do a creditable job of setting up the terrifying scene, only to have something unexpected happen. [28 Oct 1988, p.7]","58","95271"
"6674","Woo directs Mission: Impossible 2 cautiously, as if still introducing himself to U.S. audiences despite Face-Off and Broken Arrow. Or maybe he has nothing left to say about the poetry of violence after such visual eloquence in his Chinese classics. [24 May 2000, p.1D]","58","120755"
"6675","Thriller is hardly the word for this tedious exercise in clue-hiding.","58","368447"
"6676","In the end, the battle scenes are elegant and compelling and there are some fine moments when O'Toole, as Priam, summons his inner Lawrence of Arabia and makes us believe that we're actually watching a tragic altercation that brought down great men descended from gods.","58","332452"
"6677","So grim and humorless that the first half almost sinks into silliness.","58","195714"
"6678","Elegant yet surprisingly remote royal-court drama.","58","119280"
"6679","It's seductive in its buildup but overall as subtle and, alas, as humorless as a hatchet to the brain.","58","389722"
"6680","Adults will quickly tire of the dragon antics; kids will be bored by all the moralizing and faux metaphysics. [31 May 1996]","58","116136"
"6681","The Bill & Ted movies derive much of their humor from the blending of extremely low and extremely high stakes. Face The Music kind of blows it on the former: For all the preaching about the importance of togetherness and unity, the film mostly keeps its fiftysomething stars and their kids apart. Which is a shame.","58","1086064"
"6682","Penn's film oozes an intellectual's fashionable contempt for the characters.","58","61418"
"6683","It’s good enough to be dangerous, and bad enough to demand better. It’s going to turn the world upside down and make us all hysterical in the process. For better or worse, it’s exactly the movie the Joker would want.","58","7286456"
"6684","It devolves too often into slapstick shenanigans and comedy of embarrassment.","58","455538"
"6685","The movie, at its best, is compellingly odd, which is also the most accurate description of Carrey's performance.","58","1045772"
"6686","Boy Erased has problems depicting the fear, intimidation and psychological trauma such programs can inflict on even the most willing of participants. But that’s likely because, at its core, the film isn’t really about the gay conversion experience.","58","7008872"
"6687","There is no law requiring a biopic to make “nice” with its subject, but Get On Up, which presents Brown almost entirely unflatteringly except as a performer, makes you wonder why the filmmakers (including Mick Jagger, one of its producers) took the trouble.","58","2473602"
"6688","A frustratingly old-school, Hollywood-style, inspirational biopic about Amelia Earhart that doesn't trust a viewer's independent assessment of the famous woman pictured on the screen.","58","1129445"
"6689","There are moments of real wonder and even beauty amidst the slam and the bang and the big bada boom, and while Lucy is a mixed bag, it's been mixed by a master, and it is delightfully, happily insane.","58","2872732"
"6690","In their hands [Terry Gilliam or Tim Burton or even Steven Spielberg], Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone might have made as terrific a movie as it is a book. When Columbus got the job, however, it was guaranteed only to be a commercial success.","58","241527"
"6691","Like its tattered setting, The Rover is scattered with intriguing ideas never successfully fleshed out.","58","2345737"
"6692","For a film that reminds use over and over that this is a whole new world, this movie feels awfully familiar.","58","1837703"
"6693","It would have made for a cool fictional thriller, but The Mothman Prophecies' attempt to stick to true-life roots paralyzes it from being satisfying. It gives you the tingles all right, but they won't follow you out of the theater.","58","265349"
"6694","While Stallone likely hopes to go out with a bang, this small, manipulative movie doesn't have any real punch to it.","58","479143"
"6695","Good intentions don't always make for good movies. Case in point: Zootopia, a Disney film with more on its mind than animated fun and fuzzies. So much, in fact, that it loses track of what audiences expect, what they're being sold.","58","2948356"
"6696","The extended musical performances showcase Hiddleston’s chops, but the script can’t provide enough assistance for us to care. He embodies Williams and the singer/songwriter’s story is up on screen, but I can’t say I remained interested beyond his transformation.","58","1490785"
"6697","Though it's impressive in many technical and surface ways, The Croods lets us down on the essentials of character and story, and no amount of late-stage father/daughter bonding or vertiginous 3D cliffside tumbling can make up for that.","58","481499"
"6698","flat and disappointing.","58","829193"
"6699","There is some fun to be had with Bird Box. Despite its sporadic eye-roll moments, the film is charming. It’s the epitome of a rainy day movie – a flick that you can watch wrapped in a blanket with a hot cup of cocoa when it’s too dreary to leave the house.","58","2737304"
"6700","Rudd is amusing enough; Segel, who towers over Rudd, is amusing, too, though the role seems to have been written for Owen Wilson. Maybe Wilson was busy. Lucky him.","58","1155056"
"6701","It is preachy, didactic and heavy-handed as only an Oliver Stone movie can be. And yet ... and yet... despite all this, the film has an undeniable cumulative power. [20 Dec 1991]","58","102138"
"6702","Schumacher's depictions of street life are cartoonishly ludicrous and riddled with cliches -- a pair of garish hookers, for instance, can't be excused simply because one is played with engaging vigor by Paula Jai Parker.","58","183649"
"6703","Had they ended 20 minutes in, ""Wedding Crashers"" would qualify as a gut-busting triumph, and Hard Candy would be a miniature masterpiece.","58","424136"
"6704","Anyone in the market for a bittersweet romantic comedy could do worse.","58","230838"
"6705","Cameron Crowe crams at least three movies' worth of plotlines into Elizabethtown, and gives short shrift to all of them.","58","368709"
"6706","While its righteous rage is bracing, fans of the filmmaker Bahrani used to be will mourn the subtlety and careful character development of his early triumphs. His heart remains in the right place, but his head has gone hopelessly Hollywood.","58","2891174"
"6707","Has almost none of the nail-biting suspense and fascinating character interplay that made the original so authentically terrifying.","58","212985"
"6708","Wasikowska doesn't seem much changed from her ""Alice"" role, and she trips through Jane's adulthood as though it were a fantasia instead of a moody suspense story.","58","1229822"
"6709","Unlike so many comedies, Sausage Party only gets funnier as it goes along — there are dozens of duffed jokes along the way...but the script mines its demented premise for its full potential, and the plot crescendos to an ending so good that you’re likely to forgive many of the dull moments that came before it.","58","1700841"
"6710","In this oddly uninvolving caper, the size of skulls makes its own statement: The producers assume that audience interest in movie stars is bigger than audience interest in characters.","58","1013743"
"6711","The difference between ""Pretty Woman"" and Runaway Bride is that we can no longer buy Roberts in her tearful romantic-melancholy mode. It seems vaguely patronizing now.","58","163187"
"6712","Such a bluntly impersonal thriller that the title might almost be describing the production honcho who greenlighted yet another Die Hard clone.","58","116253"
"6713","Gerwig can't make her character come alive, though, and neither can Adam Brody as one of their neediest male cases. In the midst of the froufrou, lovely, stalklike Analeigh Tipton (Crazy, Stupid, Love) is delightful as a student who enjoys being normal and living in this century.","58","1667307"
"6714","Notes on a Scandal isn't humorous or witty enough to sustain black comedy, and it isn't insightful or deep enough to suggest a contemporary tragedy. All it does is put an eloquent veneer on petty meanness.","58","465551"
"6715","Vikander doesn’t do much with a character whose chief attribute is earnestness, but Tomb Raider improves once it gets to the island and lets the derring-do take over.","58","1365519"
"6716","Has its heart someplace worthy. But its head -- not so much.","58","1172991"
"6717","Well shot and well made, Kill Your Darlings is a very competently constructed effort on a whole, but there’s an emptiness and familiarity at its core that it cannot transcend.","58","1311071"
"6718","Unfortunately, the charming Batfamily can't stay in their cave indefinitely; they've got to go out and fight crime. And that's where this elaborately high-style production from Batman Forever director Joel Schumacher hits an iceberg.","58","118688"
"6719","Caught up in its own macho symbolism, Jarhead fights a losing battle to show the human cost of warfare.","58","418763"
"6720","Soon enough a pointed ode to New York City nerve-rack and survival skills dissolves into a far more average, less compelling, and sometimes just slapdash-vicious cat-and-mouse game.","58","258000"
"6721","It's a very tony fantasy of class oppression and fascist medical exploitation (themes that may speak louder in England), but it's a lyrically inert movie.","58","1334260"
"6722","Vantage Point starts to slide off the rails when it tracks a tourist (Forest Whitaker) and his trusty camcorder; instead of Zapruder-like intrigue, the episode has him running around like an agent in a rote thriller.","58","443274"
"6723","Despite a cast of solid actors and a director with one of the most exquisite visual sensibilities in the business, the film is too often flat when we want it to dazzle us.","58","325805"
"6724","While Bening does a studied impression of Grahame’s supple body language, she uses a light touch when recreating her Betty Boop-esque voice, letting Grahame’s seductiveness ooze from her gorgeously refined pores.","58","5711148"
"6725","My first thought in watching The Hobbit was: Do we really need this movie? It was my last thought, too.","58","903624"
"6726","Tower Heist is the cinematic version of a Trump property: overblinged, eye-catching, and essentially tacky.","58","471042"
"6727","Neither powerful nor interesting. It is a run-of-the-mill movie ''product'' developed as part of a 50 Cent marketing plan.","58","430308"
"6728","The movie is not exciting, original or instructive enough to justify the unpleasant experience.","58","804522"
"6729","Yes, it’s the DCEU’s best film, but as we know, that’s not saying a lot. But, hey, that terrific second act that we should cling to even if it’s a distant memory by the time love defeats aggression. “Wonder Woman” might be molded by the mighty Gods, but as shaped by mere mortals her mettle and beliefs and can be only so wonderfully divine.","58","451279"
"6730","Has all the CGI sorcery of a Harry Potter pic, but none of the magic.","58","814255"
"6731","The Hateful Eight doesn’t have enough ideas. Set almost entirely in a snowed-in saloon, the story’s so spare it doesn’t warrant either its three-hour running time (including an overture and intermission) or his use of 70mm projection. It’s narratively and visually claustrophobic.","58","3460252"
"6732","Directed, with overfondness for the goofy ways of guys, by Ted Demme and written, with overfondness for the sound of guys pontificating about nothing, by Scott Rosenberg.","58","115639"
"6733","Performances are for the most part strong, especially Seyfried's, and Kusama uses Fox well, making the most of the actress' blank-eyed arrogance. It's not a performance that suggests a lot of range, but it's fun to watch.","58","1131734"
"6734","Misplaced hero-worship and glibness get in the way of its amazing true story.","58","765429"
"6735","Although the big-screen adaptation of Nicola Yoon’s best-selling young adult novel finds welcome specificity in its world and character building, it never rises above the most generic of platitudes in its central teen love story.","58","6423362"

"6738","Foley is an actors' directors stuck here with a genre piece, and it shows: The action (save a killer car chase) is clumsily staged. Still, the story about corrupt police in New York's Chinatown has occasional moments of depth. [12 Mar 1999]","58","142192"
"6739","Feels like half of a good movie, much of it revealed in admittedly thrilling trailers.","58","1318514"
"6740","It wants to be both an art-film homage and a rollicking, outrageous sex farce, and it's not really enough of either to make an impression.","58","770772"

"6754","It's technically impressive, but most of the better aspects of Sanctum would be almost – maybe exactly – as effective viewed the old-fashioned way.","58","881320"
"6755","What a dull, nice movie, wrenched from a wild premise and battered into docility.","58","477347"
"6756","It's one thing to make a minor, accomplished work after focusing on grander statements, but Julieta mainly disappoints because it feels like the kind of straightforward, unadventurous drama that the filmmaker generally excels at reinventing through his own peculiar vision. This time, he plays it too safe.","58","4326444"
"6757","Déjà Vu is watchable trash, meticulously edited in Scott's skip-stutter style, but there's something ultimately unsatisfying about a thriller that more or less makes up its rules as it goes along.","58","453467"
"6758","Crimson Peak ends up feeling like a bit of make-work, a project to keep the visionary filmmaker busy until something that truly sparks his passion comes along.","58","2554274"
"6759","It’s an impressive movie in many ways, dizzyingly complex and intensely brainy, but if you don’t buy into the complex plot and its many (MANY) twists, they tend to be more tiresome than exhilarating. It’s a loving, labyrinthine homage to a genre I’m not sure deserves it.","58","8946378"
"6760","In Stay, the director, Marc Forster, fresh from ""Finding Neverland,"" turns Manhattan into a nightmarish dreamscape and his characters into self-destructive ghosts.","58","371257"

"6762","A pile of muck (old muck, too) with no rake, Steven Spielberg’s National Board Of Review-approved Nixon-era newspaper drama The Post lacks the exact thing it glorifies: a reporter’s instinct for story.","58","6294822"
"6763","In the early going, though, Waititi manages to keep the tone light and the humor surreal enough to avoid too much association with the real world. But as his story devolves into melodrama, the comedy curdles.","58","2584384"
"6764","It's an agreeably unambitious comedy that might be called a romp, if that word didn't imply a little too much energy.","58","1119646"

"6768","Were it not for Anne Hathaway's Catwoman-ish Selina Kyle, there wouldn't be a single character in ""Rises"" who cracks a smile.

"6771","I expected, even wanted to cry at The Fault in Our Stars, or at least choke up a little. Yet the transparent eagerness of this movie to break hearts, through means not entirely justifying that end, always pulled me back.","58","2582846"
"6772","Fincher likely prides himself on turning coal into diamonds at this point, but Flynn's script can feel so retrograde at times that one wonders whether it might have been better served by a De Palma, Bigelow, or even a Verhoeven — which is to say, a filmmaker less concerned with making the lascivious seem prestigious.","58","2267998"
"6773","There’s an irony that a movie about a trans individual who needs to live and be accepted as a woman should have some of the worst symptoms of a very straight and very male gaze.","58","810819"
"6774","Kilner's light touch keeps the romantic pair dancing around their romance without tripping, but as the film reaches the inevitable happy ending, the steps look all too familiar.","58","372532"
"6775","Waste enough of the audience’s time with the adventures of a couple of uncharismatic dinguses, and Depp’s stage-drunk, innuendo-laced, cabaret-emcee shtick starts to creep back into being funny.","58","1790809"

"6782","Paul Thomas Anderson’s Phantom Thread is passionless window-shop cinema, each static tableau lovingly arranged for display and easy dusting. Its centerpiece is a mannequin, albeit played by Daniel Day-Lewis, whose gift for keeping anything interesting is seldom so necessary.","58","5776858"
"6783","War of the Planet of the Apes has all the bombast and sense of finality seemingly required for the end of a trilogy, but there’s an underlying emptiness that nags with each scene.","58","3450958"
"6784","There's no reason to actively dislike the film, but that's not enough, not at today's ticket prices. Just because you're not despicable, after all, doesn't mean you're the pick of the litter.","58","1323594"
"6785","Elba is one of those actors who radiates his own force field even if he’s sitting still, or just tying his shoe. His no-nonsense performance helps to eradicate some of Sorkin’s nonsense.","58","4209788"
"6786","It's funny. Dumb, yes, but funny.","58","852713"
"6787","The movie is a straightforward nuts-and-bolts affair of no particular consequence, except for Neeson’s performance, which rightly does not resolve the question: Was Felt acting nobly or vengefully?","58","5175450"
"6788","Maybury's attempt at a more mainstream movie is really just a simple love story cloaked in a lot of metaphysical mumbo-jumbo.","58","366627"
"6789","It more or less plays like a five-episode arc of the series, which is a strength and a weakness.","58","1000774"
"6790","The younger characters are so full of life, and the older ones so full of trenchant but predictable talking-point issues, that it sometimes feels like a middling movie encroaching on a good one.","58","4919484"
"6791","White House Down is nearly enough fun to be a bad movie that's a good time. But it always finds some way of being a drag, belching exposition and weak humor when action's all we need, then carrying the action to exhausting lengths.","58","2334879"
"6792","If your heart skips a beat during this movie, it’ll probably be from laughter. But if you adjust your expectations and go in expecting something loud, lurid, and frequently utterly ridiculous, it’s good for a cheap adrenaline rush all the same.","58","5814060"
"6793","The film's best sequences -- the troubles of the young woman -- are gems adrift in a sea of Jell-O.","58","199725"
"6794","A lot of Money Never Sleeps - too much - is about Gekko père's desire to reconnect with his very angry daughter.","58","1027718"

"6796","The fact remains that some Treks are better than others, and ''The Final Frontier'' doesn't have the surprising warmth of the very best. It's diverting, but forgettable. [19 June 1989, p.15]","58","98382"
"6797","The Spy Who Dumped Me‘s action is just so big and loud that it obliterates any quiet character moments or clever wordplay.","58","6663582"
"6798","This Diary of a Wimpy kid is too often dull, unappealing and clumsy, hobbled by unnecessary changes and inventions that add no charm, energy or, truly, point.","58","1196141"
"6799","An actor making his directorial debut, Parker, who plays Turner and also co-wrote the script with Jean McGianni Celestin, has taken hold of an incendiary subject and coarsened its complexities into agitprop.","58","4196450"
"6800","Jackman, sporting a distracting, Hart-like brown hairpiece, seems miscast. He doesn’t convincingly convey this politician’s swagger and slickness, and Reitman’s attempts to mimic a loose-limbed political movie in the style of, say, Robert Altman’s “Tanner '88” series or “The Candidate” are rather leaden. It’s a film that’s less interesting to watch than to discuss afterward.","58","7074886"
"6801","If this movie truly cost $375 million to produce and market (as the L.A. Times reported), the biggest chunk isn't on the screen.","58","1409024"
"6802","Surprisingly, though, Army of Darkness is slowest during its extended special effects sequences and best when human low-lifes are groveling in the squalor of the 13th century. [19 Feb 1993, p.8]","58","106308"
"6803","None of it is thrilling, but Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time has a Saturday matinee goofiness that'll go well enough with air conditioning.","58","473075"
"6804","As a film, Under the Skin is hauntingly freaky and ultimately frustrating. But as a movie star's gamble to be seen as more than just a moneymaking member of the Marvel universe, it's a home run.","58","1441395"
"6805","This meta-biopic is more about Jackie Kennedy as perceived in the popular imagination than it is about the woman herself. And what Larraín has to offer on this score is not terribly enlightening.","58","1619029"
"6806","At 118 minutes it's longer than ""The Philadelphia Story"" or ""Annie Hall"" or ""When Harry Met Sally"" or ""500 Days of Summer"" or, well, you get it. Working from a script by Dan Fogelman that wasn't overly bright or sharp to begin with, directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa dawdle and stretch and repeat themselves, until what should have been light and brisk becomes leaden and overdone.","58","1570728"
"6807","However refreshing the plotlessness and relative purity of Mary Poppins Returns might be, there’s a fine line between “nostalgic” and “out of touch” — between revisiting the past and living in denial of the present.","58","5028340"
"6808","Here we are again: not entertained, not nearly enough, by an installment of the ''Star Wars'' epic that, for the first time, exhibits symptoms of...nerves. And a chill, conservative grimness of purpose, rather than an excited thrill at the possibilities of cinematic storytelling.","58","121765"
"6809","Just cryptic enough to keep you guessing, and for some viewers that may qualify as a night out. But Mamet's gamesmanship was more fun when it was less eager to look important.","58","360009"
"6810","While there’s rarely a story beat that isn’t expected, there’s just enough humor from its all-star comedy voice cast to enjoy the journey.","58","2709768"
"6811","Anyone in the market for an overblown and totally mindless adventure-comedy will certainly get his money's worth.","58","859163"
"6812","As a biopic for Fischer, Pawn Sacrifice can certainly encourage viewers to research more about him. It’s just unfortunate Zwick couldn’t bring a slightly more understated approach to the entire endeavor.","58","1596345"
"6813","Gottsagen is sympathetic without being pitiable, sweet without being saintly, and funny without making himself the butt of every joke. While the writing is often perfunctory, Gottsagen has a way of making every story beat feel sincere.","58","4364194"
"6814","The problem is that something never adds up to much of anything. Even thematically, the whole picture feels all over the place, oscillating hazily between half-baked meditations on man vs. nature and unfinished portraits of family values. Even so, Saulnier’s scope and visual endurance is admirable, to say the least, and it’s clear that he could do something this brazen eventually with a much stronger script.","58","5057140"
"6815","The effect-laden showdowns feel more dutiful than daring, and the rare moments of fun are parceled out frugally, like precious nuggets of adamantium.","58","458525"
"6816","The film admirably attempts a level of emotional resonance Bay has proven largely incapable of. Even if it can’t quite wrangle those beats into one cohesive mood, it gives its leads the most they’ve had to work across this trilogy.","58","1502397"
"6817","By focusing on Mary (the subject of its source material), the film feels lopsided, especially without any other interesting characters apart from Elizabeth.","58","2328900"
"6818","How brazenly can one film rip off ""Alien,"" ""I Am Legend,"" and, somewhat oddly, ""The Poseidon Adventure""?","58","1188729"
"6819","Only Radcliffe escapes unscathed, lending Igor a convincing psychology despite the ham-fistedness of the material. But he’s not enough of a reason to resurrect this story again.","58","1976009"
"6820","It's never subtle or clever, but it's big, loud and clear.","58","207201"
"6821","In spite of sensational direction from Trey Edward Shults and raw, emotive performances by Kelvin Harrison, Jr. and Taylor Russell, the polarizing two narrative halves of Waves don’t gel to produce a satisfying whole.","58","8652728"
"6822","The movie is a decidedly mixed bag, in part, because of the equally pronounced disparities between Burton and Carroll – and between Burton and Disney, for that matter.","58","1014759"
"6823","It’s certainly fair that Creed II would be about fathers and legacies and trying to avenge the family name, but without political context, the big fight is no longer a clash of ideas.","58","6343314"
"6824","My Girl has some sweet, funny moments (the cast is uniformly appealing), yet it unfolds in a landscape of paralyzing, pop-psych banality.","58","102492"
"6825","Alexander Payne has a great idea with Downsizing and doesn’t quite know what to do with it.","58","1389072"
"6826","Still, just about everything in Goldeneye, from its rote nuclear-weapon-in-space plot to the recitation of lines that sound like they're being read off stone tablets (''Shaken, not stirred!''), has been served up with a thirdhand generic competence that's more wearying than it is exhilarating.","58","113189"
"6827","The film is so truncated, so obsessed with style and composed of so many self-contained episodes that it fails to say anything new.","58","335563"
"6828","Admirable, ambitious and impressive, but ultimately aloof, Midsommar has its delights for sure, but it lacks the emotional depth to match the sharp insights it has into the evils of the ambivalent, wishy-washy relationship (run as fast as you can).","58","8772262"
"6829","This is science fiction needing more work on the fiction part, an intriguing premise running its course halfway through. Passengers is too smart for starters to devolve into green screen spectacle relegating its attractive stars to unconvincing gapes.","58","1355644"
"6830","If Kids is simultaneously engrossing and detached, observant and just plain showy, that may be because the film is so caught up in trying to be a statement that it never develops its characters beyond their rowdy, bellicose facades.","58","113540"
"6831","The problem with Beasts Of No Nation is that it approaches war largely on the level aesthetic challenge, meaning that whatever sense of revulsion it creates comes from the personality of Commandant. It’s his absence, rather than memories of murder and rape, that hangs like a dark cloud over the movie’s intriguingly unresolved epilogue.","58","1365050"
"6832","The movie's anchored by a strong lead performance and a steady sense of humor.","58","1230414"
"6833","Too bad, because until it essentially turns into a medical-thriller version of ""Look Who's Talking,"" the movie hums along comfortably enough as slick B fare.","58","211933"
"6834","Chastain plows through this tangled scenario with an icy ferocity that's entertaining. You get the feeling that Miss Sloane would work better as a streaming or cable series, allowing more time to explore characters and issues, giving actors more room for dense dialogue. Maybe come up with a better way out of that corner.","58","4540710"
"6835","The script starts repeating its best gags about halfway through, and the direction gets ever broader as it goes along until the film finally loses all effectiveness as satire.","58","157503"
"6836","This particular film is a collection of cutesy “going in style” clichés — old lady on a motorcycle? Check. Senior-citizen oral sex joke? Check. — compiled into a road movie with shades of ""About Schmidt"" and ""Little Miss Sunshine,"" and a morbid streak that comes in to cut the quirkiness just a little bit too late.","58","3741632"
"6837","I prefer the goofier approach, which is why, even though Hemsworth isn't going to be cast in ""King Lear"" anytime soon, he's the best thing about Thor.","58","800369"
"6838","Cool Runnings is enormously unfaithful to its subject, piling on one sports cliche after another with shallow characterizations...Regardless of those faults, Cool Runnings has an agreeable goofiness to it that brushes aside any picky complaints. It isn't art, but it surely is disposable fun. [1 Oct 1993, p.6B]","58","106611"
"6839","Deserves credit for attempting something more emotional and dramatic than the typical Ferrell gagfest, but Harrelson and Benjamin's earnest subplots cost the film comic momentum and big laughs without adding much in return.","58","839980"
"6840","The Mask, a rattletrap Jekyll-and-Hyde farce, surrounds Carrey with a nothing plot and a cast of ciphers. Still, his scenes as the Mask are rowdy and enjoyable.","58","110475"
"6841","Hancock can revel in schmuckery, of course, because you and I and cute kids and peaceful oldies worldwide know in advance that there's no way on Hollywood's green earth Will Smith will ever play someone seriously, dangerously unsavory.","58","448157"
"6842","Winfrey's performance is full of stoic anger, and individual moments have ferocity and pull, yet you're always aware of them as moments.","58","120603"
"6843","Shiny but not exactly new, Bill Condon’s live-action Beauty And The Beast is a curious nostalgia object, synthetically engineered to reproduce all the same sensations as a 26-year-old movie.","58","2771200"
"6844","A few of the performances, especially Nicole Kidman’s, as the lady in charge, and Kirsten Dunst’s, as the teacher pining to flee with the corporal, have some bite, but not enough to make much of an imprint in this brittle, vaporous chamber piece.","58","5592248"
"6845","The movie is mainly an excuse to display special-effects gags in the form of the various miracles manifested -- some of which are highly imaginative, some of which aren't.","58","315327"
"6846","If the first half is an indelible treat and gives one high hopes that a film delicately placed in the awards season will in fact meet its steep expectations, the second half is troublesome and falls flat.","58","3741834"
"6847","I get that this mano a supermano story line is a sacred text among comic-book aficionados, but Dawn of Justice doesn’t do the tale any favors. It’s overstuffed, confusing, and seriously crippled by Eisenberg’s over-the-top performance.","58","2975590"
"6848","If you can stagger around the plot holes (how'd a Brazilian cargo ship with a dead crew get to Lake Michigan?), the last 30 minutes are pure, dumb monster-movie fun.","58","120004"
"6849","What it does have at the center is an actress who commits completely to the mess, even if Perry never quite deigns to show us the underlying talent that might justify her terrible behavior — or at least the loyalty of the countless friends, fans, and enablers who suffer the brunt of it.","58","7942742"
"6850","Offers tricky fragmentation without mystery or mood; it's a mosaic of fear that grows less and less unsettling as it comes together.","58","164181"
"6851","Brittain's life and literary output are worthy of celebration, and there's no better time that the centenary of ""The War to End All Wars"" to commemorate its bloody folly. It's a shame that Testament of Youth does both in such a bloodless way.","58","1441953"
"6852","I hope this won’t be his last acting job. He’s too vital to go in for such a soggy send-off.","58","2837574"
"6853","There are some clever and exciting sequences, but this $120 million epic of reconstituted Atomic Age trash lumbers more than it thrills.","58","120685"
"6854","There’s just no subtlety to any of the proceedings and while there’s an argument to made in how the film’s fairly transparent about these intentions, none of it rises above being anything more than an average historical recap.","58","4276820"
"6855","While Green Room features a number of ingeniously crafted set pieces, it quickly winds up as an excessive, borderline pornographic revelry in extreme violence.","58","4062536"
"6856","The new new new Jason Vorhees, played by Derek Mears in this Michael Bay-produced homage/update of the '80s slasher franchise, is a bit of a fox.","58","758746"
"6857","This shot-on-film-and-video trifle reveals a Bombay (that's what all the characters call it) that ""Slumdog Millionaire"" didn't: a delicate metropolis sunk in torpor.","58","1433810"
"6858","Never quite catches fire. They take a crackerjack premise and a comely, committed leading lady and turn in a merely OK film.","58","298130"
"6859","The Iron Lady is too bland to be controversial, too antiquated to speak to the present.","58","1007029"
"6860","Director Kathryn Bigelow is one of the new-style action wizards who’ve never quite mastered the nuts and bolts of telling a story.","58","102685"
"6861","There's a gripping thriller between the gaps in logic. Director Florent Siri has a tough style and an unforgiving attitude, but it drowns in the queasy blood lust.","58","340163"
"6862","For what's essentially a bad movie, Street Kings is fairly tight and energetic.","58","421073"
"6863","The Cell is foremost about singular imagery, a succession of still pictures strung together frame by frame.","58","209958"
"6864","So why, given its moment-to-moment surplus of visual imagination, does the film feel so hollow and unsatisfying?","58","446029"
"6865","Though it's a star vehicle, Carrey seems only marginally interested in rehashing the role of sweet spaz, and so he almost feels miscast.","58","1068680"
"6866","It uses a story about family as a vehicle for glorifying gangsterism. In other words, it's empty, amoral, and - in the style of other Besson productions - surprisingly easy to digest.","58","1657507"
"6867","As a blunt object, a machine built to put nerves on edge and fingers over eyes, Annabelle is still crudely (and cruelly) effective. Fear comes cheap.","58","3322940"
"6868","The result is perversely watchable, which puts it a cut above the average inane wannabe franchise-starter. With no likable characters or internal suspense to keep it in check, Wingard’s direction sputters out into a cloud of slickness and pastiche.","58","1241317"
"6869","Though intermittently entertaining, it's too long and rarely insightful in new or meaningful ways.","58","146838"
"6870","Ironically, they make the bond between John and Savannah look so natural that the ''dear John'' turn in their relationship makes even less sense than it does in the book.","58","989757"
"6871","A fairly routine heist drama and a never especially believable puzzle film.","58","454848"
"6872","It never crystallizes into a singular experience, and instead collapses in a rush of well-intentioned innovations.","58","3072482"
"6873","Basically, it's ""The A-Team"" meets ""Rambo"" meets ""Mission: Impossible,"" with a mission that's one part trickiness, four parts blowing stuff up.","58","480255"
"6874","Frequently silly, yet eminently more watchable than such leaden Schwarzenegger efforts as ''Eraser.''","58","146675"
"6875","Nothing Lee has done is as flashy or as mucked up as Bamboozled.","58","215545"
"6876","Capernaum’s neorealist spirit is smothered by its sentimentality and endless string of indignities; it’s as if the film is operating as Zain’s trial defense, every moment making his case that it probably would have been better if he’d never been born.","58","8267604"
"6877","At 86 minutes, Sleuth '07 plays like a Cliffs Notes version of the original (which was skillfully adapted by Anthony Shaffer from his own hit play) with far too much of its pacing and delicious texture ruthlessly cut.","58","857265"
"6878","The crazies themselves could be a lot more terrifying. Without the rotting ickiness of proper zombies, they just seem like methed-out Iowans looking for a fix. That’s scary, but not scary enough.","58","455407"
"6879","At least ""Elegy"" has some passion. Learning To Drive has harmless sweetness, many revealing speeches about life, and a Kingsley performance that shades strongly into a “Robin Williams as a straight-faced foreigner” routine.","58","3062976"
"6880","On the whole, The Aeronauts is a pretty good small-scale adventure movie. It’s also a pretty dull everything-else, the unceasing flashbacks providing multiple instances where telling might have been preferable to showing.","58","6141246"
"6881","Removing many of the mythical elements of the tale is an intriguing idea that would undoubtedly have paid richer dividends if it didn't mean relying on a heavy who looks like a cross between a Neanderthal on steroids and stilts, and an unusually hirsute wrestler.","58","402057"
"6882","Feels forced every step of the way. Ultimately it's the kind of under-inspired, overblown enterprise that gives Hollywood sequels a bad name.","58","289848"
"6883","Momentum, motivation and story are all swallowed by simple sensation, and the film finally exhausts itself for lack of stylistic imagination.","58","295701"
"6884","Only those already predisposed to love a TMNT movie that at least LOOKS edgy are likely to care.","58","453556"
"6885","It’s a time-waster with brains, but ultimately not enough brains, and one that wastes too much time.","58","1053424"
"6886","As an oddity of the serial killer genre, some of Berlinger’s choices ring more as engagingly strange than unsuccessful.","58","2481498"
"6887","Halloween deserves credit for its efforts to balance old and new, for taking us back to Haddonfield in a way that isn’t purely for cheap nostalgia, but it’s hard to shake the feeling that there’s something more that it could have been achieved.","58","1502407"
"6888","Doesn't keep any secrets but an open one: that Johnny Depp is on a roll, and actor's block is definitely not his problem.","58","363988"
"6889","Good, but, sadly, not good enough. Well-acted, beautifully shot and splendidly costumed, it's superior to the original in its looks, but not as potent or meaningful in its story line.","58","133152"
"6890","It was also a miscalculation to make the film so sexually explicit. It doesn't particularly serve the story and, for all his gifts, Macy is just not the kind of actor most people want to see in a whirl of sweaty, naked sex.","58","318374"
"6891","Melissa McCarthy is hilarious in every scene of The Boss, but the movie rarely keeps up with her.","58","2702724"
"6892","Oblivion has enough special-effects artistry to keep you distracted for a while. But all the eye candy in the world can’t mask the sensation that you’ve seen this all before…and done better.","58","1483013"
"6893","In Die Hard With a Vengeance, McTiernan stages individual sequences with great finesse (there's a terrific bit with Willis and five thugs in an elevator), yet they don't add up to a taut, dread-ridden whole.","58","112864"
"6894","A collision of medieval fantasy and commando action movie, where you can almost believe in the high-concept mix-and-matching.","58","253556"
"6895","The movie whips up a big old puree of ingredients borrowed from other cinematic recipes.","58","1401152"
"6896","It’s a lot of bog-standard action stuff glommed onto a deeper metaphysical muddle; Inception drawn in extra-thick Sharpie and testosterone. If the whole thing is ultimately a shell for Diesel to do what he does, the ending also takes care to sing in the key of sequel too: Come fast cars, Avatars, and farther galaxies, there will be blood, again.","58","1634106"
"6897","I just wish the movie wasn't also so monologue-choked, muted to a fault and fond of oversimplifying financial lingo to the point of meaninglessness.","58","1615147"
"6898","Since Foster plays warming-up-for-a-straitjacket panic with a clenched intensity rare to behold in a Hollywood actress, I, for one, was rooting for the radical -- that is, nuthouse -- option.","58","408790"
"6899","Adam is cute and all, but the real strings worth tying are those that bind this sisterhood of sharp, interesting, sexually active women together. Where's THEIR starring movie?","58","1411238"
"6900","The new Arthur is a feathery screwball satire, competent on its own terms, yet as the movie went on I found it increasingly hard to separate the character's self-indulgence from that of the actor playing him.","58","1334512"
"6901","If you’re not looking for reinvention and loved the first ""Sin City,"" then you'll probably love this one too. It's a gorgeous-to-look-at, brain-splattered case of ""more of the same.""","58","458481"
"6902","In the end, it’s less the Circle of Life and more the Line of Indifference.","58","6105098"
"6903","There are some attempts at a comic-bookish, film noir vibe, including a hotel where all the crooks and killers stay, forbidden by house rules from ""doing business""on the premises. And everywhere Keanu turns, he bumps into a character from HBO.","58","2911666"
"6904","The first hour is overwhelmingly exciting as Levinson uses split screens and more stylistic techniques to make his story pop. The dialogue is also delivered in impressively natural fashion, with the leading quartet discussing subjects that capture the zeitgeist. However, the ultra-violent finale goes over the top, lacking the pizzaz and inventiveness of the film’s earlier stages.","58","6205872"
"6905","Each star has his moments, and the supporting cast is good, especially Walken, playing one of his less extreme characters; Jane Seymour as his promiscuous wife; and the stunning Rachel McAdams as their daughter and Wilson's love interest.","58","396269"
"6906","The film has one thing going for it--it's certainly never boring.","58","804461"
"6907","Like Demi Moore leaking tears or Sharon Stone crossing her legs, Jamie Lee Curtis screaming is one of those glorious sights that inspire a generation of moviegoers to binge on popcorn.","58","120694"
"6908","The movie could have been a lot scarier.","58","790686"
"6909","It's Lane who's saddled with dragging this nag over the finish line, with her cliched portrayal of another single-minded woman beating men at their own game.","58","1028576"
"6910","Unless there’s something truly momentous going on, I prefer my sci-fi to be a lot more weightless than weighty.","58","2543164"
"6911","Its overall effect is distinctly underwhelming.","58","287978"
"6912","Among its better tricks, Matrix Revolutions finally gets the love-story subplot of Neo and Trinity in the right proportion.","58","242653"
"6913","The central flaw of Ocean’s 8 is that “people looking cool” isn’t much of a story. It’s a poster, maybe even a trailer, but not a story, and not a movie.","58","5164214"
"6914","In other words, 12 years have elapsed since the last Bridget Jones movie. A skinnier, more put-together Bridget isn’t necessarily a more interesting character; she’s a little more ""Sex And The City"" this time out, however incrementally.","58","1473832"
"6915","Only Rebecca Hall comes through with a genuineness that rises above Holofcener’s doodlings. Her scenes with Guilbert resonate because, in the end, Rebecca is the only character in the movie who seems to care about anything other than his or her own – take your pick – bank account, complexion, weight, guilt. In this company, she’s practically a saint.","58","878835"
"6916","Taylor’s unremarkable thriller is not one that demands to be seen in theaters, but will undoubtedly be seen and enjoyed in that rainy Sunday afternoon kind of way. There’s some comfort in that.","58","3631112"
"6917","That’s the nature of Truth: a promising build-up, dead-ending into prosaic pontification.","58","3859076"
"6918","A History of Violence is a hollow story from an empty graphic novel.","58","399146"
"6919","A deeply weird film, accomplished, gripping, disorienting, icily adept and barking mad at once. It makes for invigorating viewing.","58","286106"
"6920","The Boxtrolls is a swing-and-miss for Laika; when you move forward with revolutionary techniques while standing still in terms of your themes, stories and settings, no amount of technical trickery or animation genius can bring the boring to vivid life.","58","787474"
"6921","Director Jean-Stéphane Sauvaire (Johnny Mad Dog) makes some audacious, impressionistic choices, focusing on the nexus of sensual and brutal, but this is the rare true story that really could have used some creative embellishment.","58","4080956"
"6922","The movie too often equates drama with volume, and agita with authenticity.","58","1174730"
"6923","It’s not a terrible time at the movies, but after Coogan & Pope’s previous collaboration on “Philomena” proved to be such a genuinely satisfying example of this kind of drama, it’s hard not to feel like there’s something of a missed opportunity here, a film truly deserving of the excellent performances at its centre.","58","3385524"
"6924","Trumbo works well enough as a general survey of Trumbo's life and career, a primer on a complicated man who endured a terrible injustice, but it fails to really engage with the material, to dig deep for significant themes and salient meanings","58","3203606"
"6925","Doctor Sleep is a mess. It’s way too long, clashing somber sobriety with loony cheap thrills. The Shining homages turn shameless and cheap. The jumpscares are more funny than scary.","58","5606664"
"6926","This whole endeavor never becomes as bewitching as it should be. It’s never more than adequate, and while P.T. Barnum will go down as one of the most interesting men in history, this film won’t pull off the same feat.","58","1485796"
"6927","The hit rate gets better as the film lumbers along and the scenarios grow more extreme, but it takes a certain degree of perseverance to roll with this thing until it pays off.","58","4501244"
"6928","What's even more amazing about the actor's absorbing, sometimes depraved performance is that while the film around him is generally cheesy and obvious, Washington is to-the-bone real.","58","1907668"
"6929","The problem is, Hotel Transylvania 2 focuses so intently on parental neuroses—Dracula needs Mavis to remain his little girl and needs his new grandson to conform to his vampire lineage—that the movie itself feels smothering (especially on the heels of the similarly themed original).","58","2510894"
"6930","Huppert is great at this, and of course she is. It’s elsewhere that the film falters.","58","8019694"
"6931","Small touches point to a slightly better movie hiding beneath most of the routine, particularly the respectable finale that stops just short of the clichéd resolution expected of it. On the whole, however, The Way, Way Back dances to a tune we've heard too many times before.","58","1727388"
"6932","Has some vitality, but it sinks into cliché just the same.","58","2179116"
"6933","The result isn't liberated from the stage; it's trapped, with waxworks literalness, onscreen.","58","293508"
"6934","A Mighty Heart has the surface tension of a first-rate docudrama but neither the passion nor the vision to encompass its powerhouse subject.","58","829459"
"6935","It's often stylish and exciting, but the pile-up of cool kills, hot bodies, and other unprocessed bits of juvenilia doesn't add up to a good time.","58","985694"
"6936","Something is wrong under this big tent. Actually made to resemble a good old-fashioned, crowd-pleasing movie, this cinematic Water for Elephants droops and lumbers like Rosie the elephant herself.","58","1067583"
"6937","The movie has been hailed and marketed as this year's Little Miss Sunshine, but it has none of that movie's empathy and comic surprise. Too much of it is like a subpar episode of Freaks and Geeks, padded out to 92 minutes with pseudo-witty dialogue.","58","467406"
"6938","It’s hard to ever shake the sense that everyone would be much better off just queuing up Östlund’s film and moving on.","58","4558376"
"6939","The movie is ornate, arbitrary, and fetishistic, too, with the added challenge of being hell to follow for those without access to crib notes. Intellectually, I can admire the emphasis on visual style over plot clarity.","58","360486"
"6940","While Redford frames the drama with a tense atmosphere, it doesn't shake the sense that we're watching a tame made-for-TV affair.","58","968264"
"6941","Richard Jewell is ultimately a character assassination that rests on hackneyed narratives and lazy assumptions. Which makes it exactly the kind of thing it thinks it’s railing against.","58","3513548"
"6942","Rather than developing Roman’s conundrum, Roman J. Israel, Esq. settles for a prosaic character study laid out in painfully obvious terms, with a tacked-on twist in the third act just so that the story can find some way to end.","58","6000478"
"6943","Isn't a complete waste of time. If Kutcher seeks to transition from national joke to lightweight actor, he's made a decent stab at it.","58","289879"
"6944","By the time we get to the unsurprising surprise ending, what seemed innovative and challenging in Taking Lives has lost its juice and reverted to formula form, and we leave the theater with that same old let-down feeling of having endured a ritual one more time.","58","364045"
"6945","It may be an accidental historical parallel that, at times, we seem to be watching a 19th-century version of ''The John Walker Lindh Story,'' but the fluke is only enhanced by the weird anonymity of Ledger's performance.","58","240510"
"6946","The handful of songs are catchy, and the whole film feels pleasantly airy. But this is a dark story with a heavy message, and it's been transformed into a harmless, pretty confection. In defanging it for comic effect, the filmmakers have done Seuss as much of a disrespectful disservice as if they'd laid on the fart gags.","58","1482459"
"6947","Slash is much sweeter than it is satisfying, but it smartly observes that the road to adulthood has never been paved, and it makes a convincing enough case that teens shouldn’t be afraid of driving down their detours.","58","4729990"
"6948","It’s an M. Night Shyamalan movie with a PhD. Or maybe an MA.","58","1149362"
"6949","The aliens aren't particularly scary or funny, and so the joke of watching Smith and Jones crack wise in their faces wears thin.","58","119654"
"6950","It's alternately mind-boggling and patience-testing, mixing astounding sequences of over-the-top invention with scenes of inept acting and indifferent filmmaking.","58","166276"
"6951","For all its f/x pageantry, it is rather tired, as if it's the third sequel of a franchise, not the initial episode.","58","167190"
"6952","In the hands of a less-skilled director, this Hollywood-mandated need to impose order could have ended in disaster.","58","391198"
"6953","Memoirs of a Geisha was never primed to be a film that burns down the house.","58","397535"
"6954","Trevorrow, like so many directors given the responsibility of delivering a straightforward blockbuster designed to satisfy bottom-line expectations, struggles to find the balance between silly and serious.","58","369610"
"6955","This makes ""Eli"" sort of wonderfully silly toward the end, as if the Hughes brothers set out to make the first-ever faith-based ""Mad Max"" movie.","58","1037705"
"6956","It says a lot about this movie that the most arresting character in it is Mary, whom Morton unsurprisingly endows with a fanatical combination of narcissism and rage.","58","414055"
"6957","There's a conflict between the film's need for some sort of closure and the messiness of the reality it depicts that leaves The Whistleblower even more unsatisfying than it was meant to be.","58","896872"
"6958","Make no mistake. In spite of its worthy subject matter and good intentions, Made In Dagenham remains mediocre to the core.","58","1371155"
"6959","Doesn't match the impact of its predecessor, which both revived and reimagined the zombie-film genre.","58","463854"
"6960","The movie comes together like a nihilistic jigsaw puzzle - with a few pieces removed for that special, indefinable dash of pseudo-density.","58","365737"
"6961","The actors themselves are more rip roaring and full of spunk than in their first outing.","58","209163"
"6962","Gudegast does provide a good amount of grimy atmosphere to his L.A. setting, and the action sequences keep you involved even as the running time starts to get gruelling. But, at 140 minutes, Den of Thieves gets too caught up in its own indulgences, and that’s a crime it can’t escape.","58","1259528"
"6963","It feels like a dumbed-down, poor man’s ""Die Hard,"" despite costing a lot more to make.","58","5758778"
"6964","The techniques of the movie, then, are sound. Wan still moves his camera and composes his shots with a patience that belies his dank Saw origins. But the cinematography isn’t as virtuosic this time around.","58","2226417"
"6965","Gary Oldman may finally get that Oscar he has long deserved for Darkest Hour, a movie that seems constructed to do little else.","58","4555426"
"6966","The movie is too cute to take itself too seriously, but it still feels like it was made by some very stoned college students.","58","219822"
"6967","Ultimately, forgettable, but for most of the way it's a pleasant little vacation of a movie.","58","800039"
"6968","For all its wit and sharp casting, State and Main is way too pleased with itself to be funny or endearing.","58","120202"
"6969","There's not a guy I know who hasn't been looking forward to seeing The Rock pick up the big wooden stick first swung by Joe Don Baker more than 30 years ago.","58","351977"
"6970","Propulsively outandish thriller.","58","936501"
"6971","There's a funny premise at the core of Are We Done Yet? Too bad the movie doesn't do much with it.","58","422774"
"6972","Director Jonathan Frakes keeps the tone just this side of tongue-in-cheek.","58","167456"
"6973","As a mainstream sci-fi film, this enjoyable, occasionally poignant effort too often feels messy in the wrong ways.","58","1731141"
"6974","There might be a great movie about any of Hoover's triumphs and secrets, but not all at once.","58","1616195"
"6975","I suppose it's a good thing that this movie has so many crisscrossing subplots. If one gaggle of whiners gets on your nerves, rest assured the scenery will soon change and another will take center stage.","58","1001508"
"6976","In fits and starts, the film matches the fire of its lead performance. Miles Ahead is far from a traditional, boilerplate music biopic, for better and worse alike.","58","790770"
"6977","It never quite adds up to anything. It's engaging enough while it's going on, but has little visceral impact or resonance.","58","417217"
"6978","Though it's handsomely made and peppered with seamlessly achieved visual glories, Narnia is ineptly acted, crudely staged and burdened with a score that only a masochist could love.","58","363771"
"6979","If Abrams had stuck with the kids and cut way back on all the sci-fi hoo-ha, his film might have stood a fighting chance of being charming. Big is not always better, even when it comes to fantasies.","58","1650062"
"6980","With no baseline ''truth'' to be found among the cartoony characters and cheesy twists, the whole production feels like a Texas-size load of secondhand lyin'.","58","327137"
"6981","Willis does everything short of donning a cape and reversing time by orbiting the Earth at light speed, and the air of cheerful ridiculousness recalls Luc Besson-produced action films like ""Transporter 2"" or ""District B13.""","58","337978"
"6982","Lanthimos doesn’t have the directorial energy to stir this thick allegorical stew. Lacking any of the conventional action-thriller movie skills, his deadpan style may be the only one available to him.","58","3464902"
"6983","Mendes has extraordinary gifts, but he has leveled them at the Wheelers like a firing squad. Strangely, he evinced no particular moralizing agenda when making films about the mob or the military. But put ordinary people in his sights and he's venomous. It's unbecoming -- and it should be worked out in private, not in a movie theater.","58","959337"
"6984","Coppola's movie has a sense of indie vitality, although the energy feels wasted by running in place.","58","2132285"
"6985","Your 12-and-unders will dig it, and it might even serve as a sort of movie-Bookmobile and get them to read a little history, or at least a little Wikipedia. But otherwise it's utterly dispensable.","58","1078912"
"6986","Lost in this beguiling labyrinth, Vanilla Sky is more fascinating as a bit of evidence than as a movie -- and ultimately less pleasing than most audiences will want.","58","259711"
"6987","Carpenter never was the filmmaker his cult claimed him to be, but in Escape From L.A., he at least has the instinct to keep his hero moving, like some leather-biker Candide.","58","116225"
"6988","Though The Informers is by no means great--nor wholly true to the vision of Ellis, who co-wrote the screenplay with Nicholas Jarecki--moments sprinkled throughout the film capture Ellis' particular mix of flip yuppie satire and lived-in paranoia better than any big-screen version of his work to date.","58","865554"
"6989","On the most basic level, the con-artist romance Focus is a Cary Grant movie in the ""North By Northwest"" or ""Charade"" mold.","58","2381941"
"6990","American Animals is fiercely entertaining from start to finish, even when its characters are acting so dumb that you start to suspect they still have some more evolving to do.","58","6212478"
"6991","The holiday movie season's only epic fantasy adventure, certainly gets no points for originality. It's such a clone of ""The Lord of the Rings,"" it probably could lose a plagiarism suit. There's also a heavy dash of ""Harry Potter."" All bases are covered.","58","449010"
"6992","Whether it's past its pop-culture expiration date or not, Into The Woods deserved a more visually inventive director to help make it work, and instead, we get something that feels somehow reduced by its translation to the screen.","58","2180411"
"6993","Although Leviathan, Zvyagintsev’s previous and far-superior effort, was hardly a masterclass in nuance, a palpable sense of empathy and flashes of humor largely compensated for its lack of subtlety. These are sorely lacking in Loveless.","58","6304162"
"6994","It's hooey, but it's hooey that picks up in the second half, not exactly redeeming itself but fitfully engaging.","58","218817"
"6995","Basically a nifty VFX reel in search of a plot.","58","1564585"
"6996","Romeo & Juliet is a series of spectacular production designs posing as a motion picture.","58","117509"
"6997","The Jackie Robinson biopic 42 operates in a box inside of a box—and not the batter’s box, either, because that would imply it has some freedom to swing away. It’s thoroughly embalmed in the glossy lacquer of conventional baseball movies, and limited further by trying to deal with the horrors of racism in that context.","58","453562"
"6998","More solidly crafted and insults its audience quite a bit less than its predecessor, and it sets up several nice emotionally complicated cliffhangers for the next installment. I hope its target audience has a blast.","58","1259571"
"6999","Before the opening credits have finished rolling, voice-over narration is lamenting the distance that can grow between even the tightest of friendships and hyping up the audience for a reunion of characters who have barely been introduced. It may be shameless, but it’s honest.","58","3564472"
"7000","The third act sustains a fevered level of absurdity and everything prior is stylish, well-acted yet off-putting.Art without any noticeable heart.","58","5715874"
"7001","Haggis doesn't trust the action to carry his themes across without emphasis, and his movie suffers for it.","58","1458175"
"7002","Ritchie manages a promising first act. But at the whim of the action movie formula, and ostensibly nothing else, priorities shift as the story carries forward. When we’re asked later on to attend to escalating stakes and a dimming tone, we’re simply left wondering what happened to all the fun.","58","1638355"
"7003","It's easy enough to accept the romantic-comedy luck of the two finding each another. It's much tougher, and ultimately useless, to buy everything else about this fairy tale of self-reinvention in a stalled economy.","58","1583420"
"7004","A feature-length tribute to great directors with no direction of its own, his second feature is the kind of self-consciously quirky, slapdash movie that still leaves a viewer eager to find out what its director will do next.","58","2582496"
"7005","Blunt and Friend strike a few flinty sparks, and Julian Fellowes’s script has its share of dry-as-dust witticisms. Most of the time, though, it’s a stiff pageant.","58","962736"
"7006","It's a showpiece for that Belgian city's medieval splendor. You may want to book vacation reservations upon leaving the theater, although the memory of this underwhelming movie may tarnish the sightseeing.","58","780536"
"7007","And when [Roberts is] on screen with Mulroney, who seems a frat-house jerk -- all dimples and a perma-tan -- we don't feel much of anything.","58","119738"
"7008","It’s a real shame that Walsh decides to concentrate a big chunk of her movie on the stilted love affair between Everett and Maud, in a relationship that starts aggressively intriguing, but becomes the definition of saccharine by its climax.","58","3721954"
"7009","Let down by muddy characterization and a choppy directorial style, the drama finally coheres in its final act to deliver the uncompromising thrills that have been Sheridan’s trademark.","58","5362988"
"7010","By bringing the story into Iraq, Grant Heslov courts tastelessness. Gooniness and Gitmo don't mix.","58","1234548"
"7011","With the sound off, Baz Luhrmann’s The Great Gatsby surely looks as radiant and extraordinary as some of the most dazzling movies ever committed to celluloid, but with the sound up and the experience on full volume, the movie is mostly a cacophony of style, excess and noise that makes you want to turn it all down a notch...or three...","58","1343092"
"7012","It is somewhat disappointing to leave a movie without a full grasp of what you’ve just watched. Still, there’s something rather wonderful in seeing a filmmaker take a proper swing with an original concept in a tentpole world increasingly populated by sequels, remakes, and reboots. And while Tenet might not make it easy to connect the dots, it’s still a thrilling ride to herald the return of cinema-going.","58","6723592"
"7013","Green Book lacks the depth it aspires to, and only works on a very superficial level. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali give exceptional performances but this message movie fumbles its message.","59","6966692"
"7014","Like many of Emmerich’s movies, even the better ones, Midway loses sight of the humanity inside its vast vistas of devastation. It’s a giant film with a very small impact.","59","6924650"
"7015","Frankly, Elysium is a bit of a liberal’s wet dream: the good guys want accessible healthcare, while the bad guys want to do away with undocumented immigrants.","59","1535108"
"7016","Lawrence (and his star, Jennifer Lawrence) want to leave no doubt that this is the lurid, infuriating stuff of the adult-minded, drenched in sophistication and pain—much like Lawrence’s dystopic vision for The Hunger Games, only anchored in the hyperreal world of the New Cold War we may be starting to realize isn’t “new” at all.","59","2873282"
"7017","Hold the Dark is a perfectly adequate film made by an especially talented director, Jeremy Saulnier. Alternately pulse-racing and somnambulant, it’s a thriller that starts strong before running out of gas.","59","5057140"
"7018","Bright is a series of disconnected action vignettes that work as standalone sequences, but don’t hang together in any kind of meaningful way. It’s impossible to not think of Suicide Squad’s similar failings as Bright barrels from one dark, noisy scene to the next.","59","5519340"
"7019","The Founder never steps up to become the biting satire of American capitalism it so begs to be. The film is not here to praise Ray Kroc, but neither is it here to bury him.","59","4276820"
"7020","Labaki’s filmmaking suggests uncertainty at best and lack of confidence at worst. She layers on the suffering too thick.","59","8267604"
"7021","Phillips simply tries to do too much.","59","5112578"
"7022","Tusk is revolting, but that’s entirely the point of Kevin Smith’s admirably imaginative and utterly disgusting latest feature, a twisted fairy tale that trades on gross-out gags and visual shockers instead of actual story.","59","3099498"
"7023","Stanton has built a fantastic world, but the action is unmemorable. Still, just about every sci-fi/fantasy/superhero adventure you ever loved is in here somewhere.","60","401729"
"7024","The General's Daughter isn't a poorly made or acted film, but it's so shallow, hypocritical, and sleazy that it's difficult not to find it repulsive.","60","144214"
"7025","It's a gritty story made in the director's more elegiacal mode, a confusion of style and content that is not in the film's best interests.","60","139668"
"7026","Sometimes a film takes your breath away by dint of its brilliance. Sometimes it's on account of its ineptitude. And just occasionally, it's for its shamelessness. Hyde Park on Hudson, for all its captivating shots of cornfields and estimable performances, is the latter.","60","1477855"
"7027","Green Book is a thoroughly predictable and conventional true-life drama, but at least Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali make for decent company along the road.","60","6966692"
"7028","Concussion could have used the political backbone of Smith’s Ali director Michael Mann; instead, it has Peter Landesman, who steers both lead actor and screenplay away from the sharper edges.","60","3322364"
"7029","It's a pleasant movie, written with care for the characters. But as the film's title suggests, scriptwriter Mark Andrus has made too obvious and clunky a metaphor of George's house.","60","264796"
"7030","We may never know how Spacey would have been, but Plummer is easily the best thing about a film that is technically accomplished, yet a bit too mechanical in the way it sets up and executes the high-stakes kidnapping at its center.","60","5294550"
"7031","Far too long, but thanks to Depp--and to Bill Nighy, properly mean beneath his suckers and blubber--it swerves away from the errors committed by the other big movies this summer.","60","383574"
"7032","All of which works terrifically well up to a point.","60","1074638"
"7033","The entire cast, in fact, seems to be having fun, with Affleck and Koechner cheerfully stealing each one of their scenes. And the jokes come often enough to leave us consistently amused and occasionally delighted.","60","1225822"
"7034","Crammed with such big-name crowd-pleasers as Mel Gibson, Jodie Foster and James Garner, Maverick reaches for that Feel Good feeling. It settles for Feel OK.","60","110478"
"7035","Despite all the computer-generated effects and highflying superhero theatrics, this roughly $120 million movie is, with few exceptions, remarkable only in its small human touches.","60","145487"
"7036","When functioning like a magic trick, this breathlessly entertaining picture delights in its showmanship, but the more entertaining the trickery, the tougher the explanation, and when the truth is revealed the answer can't help but fail to satisfy.","60","1670345"
"7037","As a series of action set pieces, the movie is frequently gripping and always highly watchable. However, when the movie strays into weirder territory --- where, one feels, Jeunet's heart really lies --- there's a growing feeling of inadequacy.","60","118583"
"7038","While Talbot and Fails claim to have walk-and-talked their way all over San Francisco, the script — and especially the dialogue — is the most disappointing element of their first feature.","60","4353250"
"7039","Lame, but in a good way.","60","110027"
"7040","The odor of musty, late-’80s nostalgia may still hover around this already threadbare brand, but you simply don’t see movies that leave both the curious and the fans who truly care this viscerally satisfied anymore.","60","1424381"
"7041","Lonergan's validation of big-minded small-town life has been neatened up to the point of blandness.","60","203230"
"7042","It’s ragged round the edges, but then Fritz Kiersch is working with a budget Roger Corman would laugh at, and he does a good job.","60","87050"
"7043","This latest special-effects free-for-all from Jan De Bont is a lavish illustration of how to take a fairly modest black-and-white horror film from 1963 and amplify it so relentlessly that the sight of the flying cow in Twister would not be all that amiss.","60","171363"
"7044","Sully is so square, it’s a wonder it even gets airborne. Hanks’s walking iceberg never thaws; the actor is never as vulnerable as he was in Captain Phillips.","60","3263904"
"7045","Poorly written nonsense, but lovers of beefcake action will be happy enough with the heroes gymnastically vaulting monsters and slicing and dicing their way around the ancient world. An extra star for Ralph Fiennes, who is a god.","60","800320"
"7046","If nature -- if life -- is as wild and precious as the movie makes it out to be, Hirsch needs to give us something, someone, to watch on-screen. We need to feel a presence before we can take the measure of an absence.","60","758758"
"7047","With its zany daily episodes, ""Groundhog"" gets stuck in a non-progressive repetition.","60","107048"
"7048","Am I alone in thinking that computer animation is the work of the antichrist?","60","126029"
"7049","A surprisingly sweet romantic comedy debut from Ben Stiller.","60","110950"
"7050","When the suspense setpieces do come, many of them are staged with considerably less imagination—with cheap jolts underscored by an intrusive score—than would be expected from director Wes Craven.","60","120082"
"7051","Steel battleships and raining fire are Midway’s primary colors; the movie flaunts its hugeness at every turn. You’ll never mistake it for the real thing, but Emmerich’s eye for historical detail is scary.","60","6924650"
"7052","The hinted romance, featuring Aaliyah, makes for some decent drama and some fine comedy.","60","165929"
"7053","Murray doing what he does best, if you like that sort of thing.","60","96061"
"7054","We get one lovely, cheering sequence of a trashed room putting itself in order, like the untidy nursery in ""Mary Poppins,"" but the rest of the magic here feels randomly grabbed at.","60","417741"
"7055","The result is handsome and logical, but missing the spark that would make it thrilling.","60","372784"
"7056","Understatement is one of Mark Wahlberg’s greatest assets. But that admirable trait winds up working against him in The Gambler, Rupert Wyatt’s otherwise intriguing dramatic thriller.","60","2039393"
"7057","The characters and settings are attractively designed, and the vocal performances have real color and a sense of fun that gently undercuts the treacly sincerity of certain obligatory kid-pandering moments.","60","1446192"
"7058","It wants to be a modern ""Taxi Driver""; it manages to be the new Falling Down, with Foster as fierce as ever.","60","476964"
"7059","The Fighter, for all the dedication of its players, takes a heavy swing at us, and misses.","60","964517"
"7060","It is a noble aim, and Reynolds drenches his movie in earthy, muddy tones.","60","375154"
"7061","Del Toro is giving scope to a boyhood lust for mayhem, the multi-million-dollar equivalent of kicking over sandcastles and torturing insects. There is something infectiously juvenile in that.","60","1663662"
"7062","In spite of the uniformly strong performances, 13 Conversations largely factors out human nature, leaving a giant puzzle where each piece is pre-determined to fall into place. In the end, the Sprechers have a movie for people who brag about finishing the New York Times Sunday crossword in pen.","60","268690"
"7063","The salesmen's scams are entertaining, but their spritzing is too tame, and the action is prolonged with limp, wavering scenes. Levinson wants to be on the humane side of every issue, The best work is done by the supporting players.","60","94155"
"7064","The Shape of Water is a movie of too many ideas, including love. For that reason alone, it drinks like a bottomless glass of velvety wine.","60","5580390"
"7065","The film does achieve moments of catharsis, but it can be heavy going.","60","935075"
"7066","Comes too late, far surpassed by similar and more visually stunning devices in ""The Matrix,"" and even by the mind-bending realities of ""eXistenZ.""","60","139809"
"7067","Mildly engaging, formulaic.","60","108327"
"7068","Romero's fourth-grade dialogue doesn't help matters, but anyone seeking out the latest achievements in cranial ruptures, spewing-blood gouts, and ground-beef spillage need look no further.","60","418819"
"7069","While art by definition must trigger certain emotional responses, occasionally there’s too-obvious a feeling of really being manipulated and stroked. Fact that Rocky gets his big chance from cynical schemers–with a black public hero as the instigator–rests uneasily at moments. Then there are occasional flashes that the film may be patronizing the lower end of the blue-collar mentality, as much if not more than the characters who keep putting Rocky down on the screen. However, Avildsen is noted for creating such ambiguities.","60","75148"
"7070","The payoff matters at least as much as the setup, and this story's secret is way too easy to guess.","60","230600"
"7071","Your opinion of this unasked-for but likable comedy sequel depends entirely on whether your reaction to the statement “It’s better than the first one” is 1) “Dear God, it could hardly be worse” or 2) “Awesome!”","60","2170439"
"7072","Borderline dull to sit through, The Sixth Sense is actually rather interesting to think about afterward because of the revelation of its ending.","60","167404"
"7073","Boasts sporadically electrifying visuals but a frustratingly messy mythology.","60","2870612"
"7074","The improvisational flair, unpredictable tonal shifts and overt emotional lurches that highlighted American Hustle and Silver Linings Playbook are here less consistently inspired and affecting, resulting in a heartfelt fairy tale that only soars in spurts.","60","2446980"
"7075","The deliberate pace may suggest that the film is being thoughtful, but Let Me In is really just an exploitation movie with the confidence to take it slow.","60","1228987"
"7076","Sincere, capable, at times moving, but overextended, this picture is seriously hampered by its tendency to linger over everything--especially landscapes with silhouetted figures, and not excluding its own good intentions.","60","99348"
"7077","Unfortunately, screenwriter Christopher Bertolini has given Eckhart and Liebesman a story so riddled with war-movie cliches that it contains almost nothing else.","60","1217613"
"7078","Since the movie arrives and succeeds as entertaining B-movie fare, we may as well appreciate all of its howls, beastly or unintentional.","60","238546"
"7079","If anything, as it lathers up into an abortive attempt at scarlet-woman branding and a goofy siege on the nunnery where a dazed and confused Antoinette has holed up, The Duchess of Langeais works best as the comic bondage fantasy implied in its deliciously sly French title: ""Don't Touch the Axe.""","60","781435"
"7080","Director Stephen Hopkins (Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child) and writer Akiva Goldsman (Batman and Robin) layer a ridiculous time-travel tale with the story of a dysfunctional family Robinson, impressive special effects, and IKEA does Star Wars production design.","60","120738"
"7081","It's a bare-knuckled crime drama set in 1988 that stylistically could have been made that year and emphasizes Gray's strengths as a director while drawing attention to his limitations as a writer.","60","498399"
"7082","The picture doesn't come together and much of it is cluttered, squawky, and eerily unfunny. But there are lovely moments --especially when Olive is loping along or singing, and when she and Popeye are gazing adoringly at the foundling Swee'Pea (Wesley Ivan Hurt).","60","81353"
"7083","Enjoyable enough nonsense, even if it barely cracks a smile.","60","944835"
"7084","Formally, everything's in order-it's an attractive film with some ingenious action sequences-but the problems overwhelm the pleasures, leading to the conclusion that this film's trouble is under the hood.","60","1216475"
"7085","Features one of the rare complex portraits of a therapist.","60","140397"
"7086","What compels then isn't the overwrought plot, but the simpler things, the dynamics between the actors, the avuncularity between old pros Costner and Hurt and the class condescension between Costner and Cook. It has a fascinatin' rhythm.","60","780571"
"7087","Of the three, Real Genius comes tantalizingly close to being a real, and interesting, movie. If only Coolidge weren't hemmed in by the formulaic plot. [26 Aug 1985, p.62]","60","89886"
"7088","Director Dennie Gordon keeps the pace brisk, and between makeovers and pratfalls, the girls deliver an easy-to-swallow dose of girl power.","60","363282"
"7089","Holes will no doubt speak clearly and appealingly to its intended early teen audience.","60","311289"
"7090","Not as satisfying as the old and unimproved version. In a zealous attempt to broaden its appeal, the Zorro franchise has drifted from the qualities that made the previous film so successful.","60","386140"
"7091","At its best, there's nothing gushy about Dennis Quaid's portrayal of Morris, and more than anything it's his beautifully modulated reserve that holds this film in emotional check.","60","265662"
"7092","Most delightful of the Super-series for its good-natured disregard of narrative considerations.","60","88206"
"7093","Me, I'm of two minds about a movie that wants to be a nail-ripping thriller and a statement on an artist's unholy communion with her role. It's reminiscent of older, better movies.","60","947798"
"7094","Inspiring if not inspired, Lee Daniels' The Butler is a sort of Readers' Digest overview of the 20th century American civil rights movement centered on an ordinary individual with an extraordinary perspective.","60","1327773"
"7095","Like any conspiracy theorist, you sense that landing on an actually airtight unified theory would almost spoil the fun for Mitchell.","60","5691670"
"7096","There's so much that's so disarmingly good and sharp about Funny People that you wish the whole movie weren't so much of a shambles.","60","1201167"
"7097","It's still a gimmicky, tricked-out tale that is all too self-aware. But the film does keep you guessing and probably guessing wrong.","60","971209"
"7098","Rather than channeling James Thurber’s satirical tone, Stiller plays it mostly earnest, spinning what feels like a feature-length “Just Do It” ad.","60","359950"
"7099","As in the novel, the story is gripping, as pleasurable as a good recreational drug. As with the drug, the high wears off pretty fast.","60","116191"
"7100","On its own terms, the plotting of ""Devil"" is absorbing, and the pieces actually fit together pretty decently. On the other hand, when scenes directly call to mind similar ones in ""Chinatown,"" this effort's stepchild relationship to the classic is forcibly demonstrated.","60","112857"
"7101","The Imitation Game is a film about a human calculator which feels... a little too calculated.","60","2084970"
"7102","The storyline does get frayed towards the end...but that’s not really the point; as long as you’re here for the dick jokes.","60","1967614"
"7103","Early promise proves misleading in a sequel that should be far better than The Da Vinci Code than it actually is.","60","3062096"
"7104","Yes, it's sappy. It's also silly, utterly unironic, a sketch stretched out to feature length, and, if you're in the right mood, pretty darned cute.","60","120888"
"7105","As a macho fantasy, First Blood is successful. But by the time it comes to its sobering, let's-put-this-all-in-a-sane-perspective conclusion, one has a right to feel powerfully misused. [25 Oct 1982, p.119]","60","83944"
"7106","Works best as a bang-and- boom action picture, a loud symphony of bombardment and explosion juiced up with frantic editing and shiny computer-generated imagery.","60","213149"
"7107","The technology for twinning a single young actress is considerably more seamless than it was in 1961, and Lohan is a perky charmer.","60","120783"
"7108","As a date-night movie for women of 50 or thereabouts, chances are it'll do the trick.","60","337741"
"7109","The contrast between Tucker's motormouth and Chan's man of few words should be funnier, but the plot -- which is cliched without quite becoming self-reflexive -- and the uneven pace dampen most of their moments.","60","120812"
"7110","There are two stormy performances from Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz that elevate Allen's melancholy thoughts on love and relationships.","60","497465"
"7111","The bottom line is that The Crow is a somewhat-better-than-average exploitation flick that has received an extra shot of hype from the untimely and dramatic demise of its star performer.","60","109506"
"7112","Hail, Caesar! keeps stumbling over its own best ideas as we stop to appreciate them – ditching momentum, preferring gaps for applause.","60","475290"
"7113","A throwback to classic movies like Charade and North by Northwest where beautiful, sophisticated people answer life-threatening danger with bon mots and ingenuity.","60","1243957"
"7114","Hidden Figures is an earnest movie, but not a very exciting one. The screenplay feels as engineered as a Gemini rocket launch, with every scene and line carefully calculated.","60","4846340"
"7115","A massive, sweaty, frequently silly epic that nevertheless delivers enough brute pleasure to pass a rainy afternoon.","60","112573"
"7116","It's creaky sentimental stuff, redolent of the Eisenhower era, but the songs are (mostly) excellent, and Vera-Ellen and Rosemary Clooney are delightful. [14 Dec 2008, p.17]","60","47673"
"7117","This Trinity may be the least of the three--sound familiar, Matrix faithful?--but it's the closest in style and attitude to a pulpy comic book, an art form that doesn't need to be lofty, perfect or even sensible to tickle a dork's fancy.","60","359013"
"7118","Pixels is a slice of pure, frivolous entertainment that doesn't try to overreach.","60","2120120"
"7119","A ruthlessly unsentimental portrait of a German war profiteer's epiphany that inspires neither sorrow nor pity, but a kind of emotional numbness.","60","108052"
"7120","Videogamers who've been itching for ""Grand Theft Auto: The Movie"" can tide themselves over in the meantime with Crank, a down-and-dirty actioner that follows a rugged antihero trying to outrun death by keeping his adrenaline flowing.","60","479884"
"7121","This is a broad, frequently cartoonish romp that plays like a less effective mishmash of To Die For and Fargo. The blunt, unashamed crudeness does provide some laughs but the tonal shifts are often uncomfortably handled.","60","5580036"
"7122","If ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" made you puke, you'd better bring a bucket to this true-life weepie about the importance of teaching music in schools.","60","166943"
"7123","Its low-gear celebration of fandom-inspired ingenuity, and belief in the power of creating as a reparative balm, earns it enough well-deserved smiles when things fall predictably into place in the latter stages.","60","5805752"
"7124","The machine itself is a beauty, with a red velvet seat and gadgets made of ivory and rock crystal, and the time-travel effects help to make this film one of the best of its kind. However, it deteriorates into comic-strip grotesqueries when the fat ogreish future race of Morlocks torments the effete, platinum-blond, vacant-eyed race of Eloi.","60","54387"
"7125","While veteran director Fernando Trueba (Belle Epoque) and writer Jean-Claude Carrière don’t bring much novelty to the May-December/muse-artist/naked-clothed cliché, they do imbue the material with genuine feeling—exploring the melancholy of waning days and a defiantly naive belief in artistic transcendence.","60","1990217"
"7126","Perhaps a folly and – Kikuchi aside - too deadpan to be a romp, this is still a decent, colourful samurai spectacle with a classical look (lots of symmetrical compositions) and a story which stands up under multiple retellings.","60","1335975"
"7127","While this jury-rigged exercise may not be an explosion of laughs, it's no dud, either.","60","1470023"
"7128","A wide-eyed tribute to human ingenuity that packs enough snark to pull itself out of the black hole of earnestness, even if its fuel runs out partway through.","60","3659388"
"7129","Though Empire of the Sun is a profoundly perplexing, frustrating object, there are things in it to marvel at and enjoy.","60","92965"
"7130","Like the earlier film, this one has an airless quality, much of the action taking place in the hushed and colorless offices of ""the Circus."" But whereas the dank tone of ""Let the Right One In"" served to heighten the moments of poignance and shrieking horror, Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy begins to seem phlegmatic after a while.","60","1340800"
"7131","If Boiler Room isn't an especially challenging movie, it's still a damn good melodrama -- a boilermaker.","60","181984"
"7132","This entertaining confection possesses the substance of the TV show, the pacing of a Hong Kong actioner and the production values of a James Bond thriller.","60","160127"
"7133","Visually more coherent than ""American Beauty,"" but despite the burnished mahogany of Conrad Hall's cinematography, Mendes still doesn't quite know how to fill a frame. Like the Hanks character, he's a slow study: The action is stilted and the tabloid energy embalmed.","60","257044"
"7134","Territory is typical small town Steven Spielberg; this time set in a coastal community in Oregon. Story is told from the kids' point-of-view and takes a rather long time to be set in motion.","60","89218"
"7135","Say what you will about (Smith's) sense of humor, genuine faith is rare enough in popular culture to make any sighting worthy of note.","60","120655"
"7136","A ferocious yet lyrical piece of filmmaking--an enchanted bloodbath.","60","162661"
"7137","Because the filmmakers have skewed the story into a Donnie-Lefty lovefest, the breakage of their trust signals the breakage of Donnie's spirit even in triumph. Case closed. It's the kind of fade-out we might expect from the it's-all-hopeless era of '60s counterculture movies. It's emotionally effective, but also a cheat.","60","119008"
"7138","For me, it tends to be a recipe in which you can't taste either of the constituent ingredients. The big man-to-wolf transformation scene is still a marvel.","60","82010"
"7139","While there are things to quibble with, there is also so much to like, and Trainwreck is still an important film. The romantic comedy, which it ultimately becomes, has been a dying genre of late, and Schumer’s effort, while flawed, is a reminder of what can make the genre so likable","60","3152624"
"7140","007 is undone by villainous scripting and misguided casting and acting in a couple of key secondary roles.","60","143145"
"7141","The film does work, but not quite as well as the Hepburn-Tracy classic that it seeks to replace. Mildly amusing.","60","101862"
"7142","Director George Clooney raids a leftover script by the Coen brothers that lacks the snap of their more vicious crime comedies.","60","491175"
"7143","It's tremendous fun, thanks largely to a smarter-than-average script and some fierce casting.","60","139134"
"7144","Though this drifts at times as storytelling, it's mainly lightweight but personable fun.","60","112697"
"7145","If you're going to pick the werewolf as your favorite monster, there's a lot to appreciate in the shaggy, imperfect but still fun new version of The Wolf Man.","60","780653"
"7146","Impressive visual invention by Nimoy and the reliability of his cast mean that Trek III does more good than harm to a franchise still competing with it's younger, more tehnologically advanced adversaries.","60","88170"
"7147","Spotlight never hits the heights of passion, but capably and decently tells an important story.","60","1895587"
"7148","Apart from Theron and Christina Ricci as her lover, there's nothing in Monster that rises above the level of doggedly well-meaning, although the film is worth seeing for the acting and as a sort of palate-teaser for Broomfield and Churchill's documentary.","60","340855"
"7149","A sky-high level of misanthropy overwhelms his film in ways that prove more sour than droll, despite the presence of skillful actors and a bizarrely enveloping plot.","60","111149"
"7150","Director and co-writer James Mangold (Girl, Interrupted) is supplying comfort food for bruised romantics.","60","35423"
"7151","Much of it is awful, but it's almost impossible not to be taken in by the narrative sprawl: like many big, bad movies, Giant is an enveloping experience, with a crazy life and logic of its own.","60","49261"
"7152","[A] scattered but not totally disagreeable CIA conspiracy thriller.","60","1599348"
"7153","Costa-Gavras's antipathy to Americans appears to be so deep-seated that he can't create American characters. The only real filmmaking is in the backgrounds: in the anxious, ominous atmosphere of a city under martial law -- the sirens, the tanks, the helicopters, the feeling of abnormal silences and of random terror.","60","84335"
"7154","Saddled with the responsibility of carrying the film, Bateman acquits himself admirably by playing it straight, developing a genuinely convincing and affecting chemistry with Robinson and taking his character's repression seriously.","60","889573"
"7155","Val Kilmer is extraordinary as Morrison, holding the centre with a demonic charisma, while Stone recreates the late '60s milieu with vibrant versimilitude.","60","101761"
"7156","All in all a comedy that starts out like a pudding made of first world problems ends up warming your heart and that is in no small part down to the strength of its two leads. As a final act, it's a touching one.","60","2390361"
"7157","Resnick has crafted an ambitious, if extremely uneven, character study.","60","266452"
"7158","A creepy, well-acted story of contagious evil, Apt Pupil has more than enough chilling dramatic scenes to rivet the attention but suffers from some hokey contrivances and underlying insufficiencies of motivation.","60","118636"
"7159","20th Century Women mainly overcomes its flaws through the sheer imaginative sensitivity of Mills’s writing.","60","4385888"
"7160","With yet another snappy script and a fiendishly clever story, Mamet leads us through this labyrinthine film with skill and wit. It's nothing terribly original, but it is a lot of fun.","60","252503"
"7161","Attempts to delve beneath the surface of Hollywood's rampant narcissism and fascination with technology, but ultimately feels like just one more in the long line of films this year about the business of making movies.","60","258153"
"7162","The final result somehow undersells a man whose life and death were watershed moments in the gay rights movement.","60","1013753"
"7163","Danny Boyle still creates an impressive world, visually rich and yet cold and claustrophobic.","60","448134"
"7164","All gothicky, christmassy, romantic and Burtonesque. Worth a look.","60","107688"
"7165","Blue Ruin is a talented but sophomoric low-budgeter that straddles the divide between genre thriller and art piece with mixed results.","60","2359024"
"7166","For the first time, Burton seems comfortable walking around the real world.","60","319061"
"7167","Precociously glib and never less than engaging.","60","265666"
"7168","Comes in well under the ninety-minute mark, leaving no room for bombast or overkill.","60","139414"
"7169","Not exactly Errol Flynn, but not the embarrassment that was Disney's Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves is a fun popcorn flick take on the centuries-old legend. And hey, it does have a great cameo by a former Robin Hood as the best King Richard ever.","60","102798"
"7170","The script, the direction and finally, Fonda's acting choices capture nothing of what made Hellman a true piss-and-vinegar original.","60","76245"
"7171","The Naked Gun 2 1/2 is at least two-and-a-half times less funny than its hilarious 1988 progenitor. But even if the laugh machine isn't operating at top efficiency, it still cranks out a few choice bits of irreverent lunacy.","60","102510"
"7172","While pic remains sympathetic and appealing, the endless dialogue and repetitive settings become wearing through the couple's one long night together, and the artifice of the premise may contribute to the difficulty the film has in coming to romantic life.","60","112471"
"7173","As we pass from one story to another the relentless savagery does get a bit grinding. In addition, at two hours in length, Szifron's film is perhaps one skit too long. Regardless, Wild Tales is an inventive, occasionally hysterical ride.","60","3011894"
"7174","The mix of light comedy and really quite dark themes proved too much for many viewers, but this is worth a look for Broderick's performance and Carrey's obsessive touches.","60","115798"
"7175","No one else can balance the ups and downs of wistful sentiment and corny humor the way Capra can - but if anyone else should learn to, kill him.","60","31679"
"7176","It's too bad that Pakula allows this 1993 movie to dawdle after its climax, but prior to that he's adept at suggesting unseen menace and keeping things in motion.","60","107798"
"7177","Fremon Craig doesn’t radically alter the conventions of the coming-of-age narrative, and so a general predictability settles over the proceedings pretty quickly. With that said, though, she does a good job observing the relationships between her central characters.","60","1878870"
"7178","Much but not all of this movie’s good work is undone by its silly and unconvincing ending.","60","5610554"
"7179","Neither triumph nor fiasco, Strange Brew leaves plenty of room for improvement, but I hope Thomas and Moranis get the chance to demonstrate that they've learned a lot from the mixed assortment of nuttiness in their first movie comedy. [30 Aug 1983, p.B4]","60","86373"
"7180","Clooney badly botches the spy plot by casting himself as Barris's agency contact... and a truly awful Julia Roberts as Barris's Mata Hari lover (she's soundly upstaged by Drew Barrymore as his devoted girlfriend). Yet the mounting delirium drives home Kaufman's basic point: that a shadow government rules by bread and circuses.","60","270288"
"7181","An unexpectedly adult emotional rollercoaster with some very cold and unsettling things to say about men, women, marriage, and the lies we so often tell each other.","60","161081"
"7182","But something compelling happens here that shouldn't be dismissed out of hand. Raging in Shange's still startlingly fluid verse like witches casting spells, this powerful cast (especially Jackson, Goldberg and Phylicia Rashad) reaches bravely, if sometimes clumsily, for emotional accountability.","60","1405500"
"7183","A decent comedy, good-natured if unspecial, amusing if rarely hilarious.","60","1092026"
"7184","That this is a patchwork quilt of a screenplay (written by five credited writers) is apparent in its use of little bits of this and little bits of that. Did none of them notice, looking at the big picture, that it's unbelievable?","60","120686"
"7185","Dustin Hoffman is superb as Lenny Bruce, but he gives an actor's performance where a less declamatory, more comedic delivery would have worked better.","60","71746"
"7186","Forceful and arresting, Ayer's follow-up to ""Harsh Times"" and ""Street Kings"" sees him confidently playing to his strengths.","60","1855199"
"7187","Amusing but sloppy and overcomplicated.","60","101452"
"7188","Hoffman has delivered a love letter to the elderly thesps of his adoptive country. We can forgive him its falsehoods.","60","1441951"
"7189","An exercise in outrageous style over substance.","60","133093"
"7190","The movie isn't as world-shattering as those bouts: It's a regretful-old-warrior weeper.","60","1125849"
"7191","In Supremacy, Damon is left to play basically one droning, humorless note, which, unfortunately, he does with his eyes closed.","60","372183"
"7192","The film sacrifices playfulness and humor to concentrate on a relentless display of elaborate but ho-hum gadgets and gizmos.","60","120891"
"7193","Heart may be what the movie needs most, but a bit of clarity wouldn't hurt either. Even here in gangsterland, where random characters are cherished and non sequiturs are considered wisecracks, there is a difference between complications and impenetrability, and this plot is a bloody thicket.. [5 Oct 1990, Calendar, p.F-10]","60","100150"
"7194","Has one of the most stupendously tasteless premises in cinema history, and much of the time when this movie tries to beckon a smile, the effect is closer to astonished nausea.","60","118799"
"7195","The director Sebastián Lelio should have been a good fit for this story if only because of the sensitivity he’s brought to female-driven movies like “Gloria.” Although Disobedience seems to offer him similar material — female desire up against the patriarchy — it defeats him.","60","6108178"
"7196","The film has a ragged charm, a Tiggerish bounce, and a certain sweet melancholy that bubbles up near the end.","60","2333804"
"7197","The movie — based on Les Standiford’s novel — is pleasantly simpleminded, often assembled from parts of other movies.","60","6225520"
"7198","The performers are a bright bunch, especially Snow (even if she's no sane person’s idea of a wallflower), Metcalfe, who has the cocksure swagger of a young Travolta, and McCarthy, who infuses her few scenes with a haggard dignity masquerading as optimism.","60","455967"
"7199","This story of a party girl (Audrey Hepburn) in love with a gigolo (George Peppard) allows Edwards to create a very handsome film, with impeccable Technicolor photography by Franz Planer. [Review of re-release]","60","54698"
"7200","What Black’s movie really has going for it is pace. It starts with a crash, followed swiftly by a bang and vast swathes of wallop. The relentlessness doesn’t allow you any time to catch a yawn, but it’s also not too conducive to tension or suspense.","60","3829266"
"7201","Kilmer makes a surprisingly effective and effete Holliday, but Russell lacks the stature for Earp - Sam Elliott as his older brother Virgil suggests a better movie. There's a misguided romantic subplot and the ending rather sprawls, but mostly this is rootin', tootin' entertainment with lots of authentic facial hair.","60","108358"
"7202","Part 4, to its credit, is the noisiest. Disappointingly, it's also the worst: not bad, just not as good.","60","122151"
"7203","Silly, good-natured and thoroughly unpretentious, this giant-spider movie has nothing more on its mind than providing the kind of brainless thrills once delivered by movies like Tarantula (1955), Earth vs. the Spider (1958) and The Giant Spider Invasion (1975).","60","271367"
"7204","All the more frustrating because of its conceptual freshness and Ben Affleck's sly turn in the title role, this sleek action thriller ends up delivering standard shoot-'em-up goods after initially suggesting it might provide something rather different.","60","2140479"
"7205","Heigl and Butler have genuine chemistry, and the writers have given the duo some bitchy, snappy dialogue. They probably had in mind such workplace comedies as ""Desk Set,"" starring Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, but in this day and age, witty banter and stars with chemistry aren't enough to catch an audience's attention.","60","1142988"
"7206","Director Christopher Landon, a veteran of the Paranormal Activity series, keeps the energy levels so peppy and the twists coming so unflaggingly, you barely have time to lodge any complaints.","60","5308322"
"7207","A feel-good picture that is a little less affecting than it might have been, but is entertaining enough.","60","1969062"
"7208","The plot is lame; the jokes are often broad, though if you have a weakness for dumb humor -- or you're under 10 years old -- you'll find them hilarious. [25 Nov 1991, p.56]","60","101272"
"7209","An enjoyable double-act – but not an infallible one.","60","8404614"
"7210","Chronicle is an energetic hodgepodge that tweaks familiar conventions just enough to seem fresh. Forget the X-Men - these are iHeroes.","60","1706593"
"7211","If this glorious pile of horror-fantasy hokum has lost none of its power to move, excite and sadden, it is in no small measure due to the remarkable technical achievements of Willis O'Brien's animation work, and the superbly matched score of Max Steiner.","60","24216"
"7212","Unfortunately, while Stallone can carry the weight, the movie can't. Too much of it is too busy -- too many undeveloped subplots -- and some of the main plotting feels murky.","60","118887"
"7213","Fury is a punchy, muscular action film, confidently put together and never anything other than watchable.","60","2713180"
"7214","In presenting its story as a portrait of a budding great statesman discovering his destiny, Barry is neither insightful nor poetic enough to justify its increasingly didactic approach.","60","5477566"
"7215","A promising idea, and yet ultimately too cute: it is a one-to-one allegory, and this much of the film is spent exploring this not very rewarding vein.","60","63442"
"7216","The picture strains for seriousness now and then, but even when it makes a fool of itself it's still funny.","60","67217"
"7217","The picture is saved from mediocrity by Mr. Raimi's smooth competence, and by the unusually high quality of the acting.","60","219699"
"7218","It’s Aronofsky’s least personal work. So you get a fat dose of conventional melodrama with your Old Testament: It’s the antediluvian ""Gladiator.""","60","1959490"
"7219","As a traditional period biopic, it checks all the boxes in fine fashion. But you’d never know it was inspired by a woman whose life was expansive and contradictory and unwieldy in the extreme.","60","5437928"
"7220","It's the casting, stupid!","60","1245526"
"7221","The remake is plenty scary, though any moral inquiry into the cost of revenge seemed to fly over the heads of the screaming, laughing crowd I saw it with.","60","844708"
"7222","What’s crucially missing, however, is a hissable villain. Nor are there any memorable tunes, which is too bad given that Broadway star Menzel is playing Elsa.","60","2294629"
"7223","A frenetic, overstuffed but imaginative fantasy.","60","963966"
"7224","It’s a film that’s good enough that you want it to be better, a rare genre example of less not proving to be more.","60","7752126"
"7225","It's been made with genuine feeling and smooth professional craftsmanship.","60","6662736"
"7226","Tim Burton’s return to real-life storytelling is entertaining but flawed. See it for a fascinating true story and a fantastic Amy Adams. Beware the uneven tone, a lack of depth and Christoph Waltz’s monumental mugging.","60","1126590"
"7227","By the end, you feel like a piñata: in pieces, the victim of prolonged assault by killer pipes.","60","1707386"
"7228","I don't see this slightly better-than-average drug thriller, with slightly better-than-average direction by Steven Soderbergh, as anything more than a routine rubber-stamping of genre reflexes.","60","181865"
"7229","It’s a formula that works and, as crowd-pleasing mainstream Britcom goes, it’s a relatively solid, if flawed, entry into the genre.","60","314331"
"7230","The gags swing between mildly inventive and screamingly obvious, but even the latter are performed and timed well enough to draw a laugh.","60","319343"
"7231","Pleasantly entertaining, Pitch Perfect 2 scrabbles for a raison d’etre, however, hoping that goodwill from the first show, coupled with a few raunchy gags and cameo appearances, will be enough to get by in the post-Glee age.","60","2848292"
"7232","Gilroy avoids the ghoulish extremes of Tom Ford’s Nocturnal Animals and offers up a believably pretentious battleground. He’s as invested in crafting a fully fleshed art world as he is in creating a full-on horror film and while the two often blend well, at other times, his concoction is far less effective.","60","7043012"
"7233","Part stoner comedy, midnight movie, outsiders’ love story and ultraviolent B-movie, this intriguing film is given real soul by stars Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart, even if director Nima Nourizadeh’s ambitions end up being more laudable than the results.","60","3316948"
"7234","Too dark for a very broad audience, it will flummox some viewers drawn by its cast but will strike others with its more-than-prickly approach and standoffish humor.","60","1403177"
"7235","Virtuosic kick-ass filmmaking can be its own reward, but to paraphrase “Idiocracy,” you still need to care about whose ass it is, and why it’s being kicked.","60","2406566"
"7236","The cast is generally game for playing cardboard cutouts, with Goodman having the most fun.","60","811080"
"7237","More political allegory than horror movie.","60","884328"
"7238","A trio of stridently weird performances--from Nicolas Cage, William Fichtner, and David Morse--brighten this otherwise rote actioner.","60","1502404"
"7239","There are numerous delights for the patient and the two leads give prize-worthy performances but at just under three hours this is one drawn-out gag that almost outstays its welcome.","60","4048272"
"7240","Watching Seven is like cracking open a safe, only to find it crawling with eels","60","114369"
"7241","Subtlety is not this movie's strong suit; even the terrific Chemical Brothers score pounds your nerves a bit more than it should.","60","993842"
"7242","Cold and cerebral, with simmering suspense rather than outright excitement, this is a feel-the-quality-of-the-acting movie. It can’t answer all sorts of questions, but does take a scary mug shot of a subtle monster.","60","401997"
"7243","There's not one single bombshell dropped in Disturbia; everyone is exactly who you think they are and does exactly what you think they'll do precisely when you think they'll do it.","60","486822"
"7244","A decent but unremarkable film with a big, unforgettable central performance. Carey Mulligan passes with First-Class Honours.","60","1174732"
"7245","To be sure, there are meaningful observations here about the ways that money warps relationships and how children struggle with their heritage. But by trying so hard to concoct a blowout party, the movie exhausts and frustrates as much as it enlightens and delights.","60","3104988"
"7246","Accepting the film's own standard of plausibility, thrillseekers should appreciate the brisk pace with which scares, setbacks and possible escapes are delivered.","60","8364368"
"7247","Once you get past the ridiculous story this is a fine example of De Palma's lush overkill style and certainly has a redeeming thread of silly sick humour.","60","86984"
"7248","It’s the women who steal the film, collectively recalling Grey Gardens (1975) in their distinctive, damaged mannerisms.","60","65724"
"7249","The work’s considerations of the intimate connection among being, art and life finally feel quite superficial.","60","5311542"
"7250","Major League trots out the standard formula, but has the wit to make fun of it now and then. The film is so loopy that it glides over its cliches and indulges in some congenial movie-baseball silliness.","60","97815"
"7251","Even a flawed Spike Jonze film is a thing of beauty in its own way, and even the uneven but admirable Her is a journey well worth taking.","60","1798709"
"7252","The three leads draw you in. The pace gives these actors time to breathe, show nuance and make their characters human.","60","3236120"
"7253","As I've implied, this is a great midnight movie: I enjoyed every patchily edited, ham-fisted scene. But I don't like seeing the wonderful Kate Winslet look stupid, or the wonderful Laura Linney abase herself.","60","289992"
"7254","Grandma is fun and brisk, though sometimes the encounters seem a little pat, and Elle’s grief about the death of her partner a year earlier is way overdone.","60","4270516"
"7255","The real problem with the film is tone and pace.","60","2935510"
"7256","Part homage, part spoof, the deft balancing act is a clever adaptation -- albeit culled from less than pedigreed source material.","60","112572"
"7257","Has sufficient mayhem to please Diesel's action fans while allowing the star to reach out to family audiences.","60","395699"
"7258","As old-fashioned movie fun, this isn't bad, even -- especially? -- when it skirts the edge of silliness, and it's better than the 1960 George Pal version.","60","268695"
"7259","This update has to be one of the most ludicrously dumbed-down versions of a classic to date. But it does have a hip, hybrid soundtrack, and, as directed by Alfonso Cuarón (""A Little Princess""), it's so visually stunning that it's almost gripping in its incoherence.","60","119223"
"7260","Payne's movie is flat, depressed, and at times -- given this director's talent -- disappointingly curdled; it needs every quivering molecule of Nicholson's repressed rage to keep it alive and humming.","60","257360"
"7261","Never quite shakes its sitcom-ish setup. The director alternates incident-laden storytelling with penetrating character moments that her terrific cast acts to the fullest.","60","842926"
"7262","It ought to be a triumph. Somehow, though, it lacks the flooding emotional force Donoghue gave it on the page.","60","3170832"
"7263","On the Basis of Sex is a solid, often impassioned film, but too often its worst instincts take over, and cliches stack up faster than legal documents.","60","4669788"
"7264","Often resembles a prime John Carpenter thriller--call it ""Assault on Manger 13""--until an overcaffeinated angel-fu climax significantly lowers the intelligence quotient.","60","1038686"
"7265","This is a Julia Roberts Movie about only one thing: being a Julia Roberts Movie.","60","195685"
"7266","Director Guy Hamilton's movie is rather more effective as an advertisement for Majorca than as a thriller, and the idea of Ustinov as Poirot remains more enticing than the reality, but you could do a lot worse. Think of it as a languid cocktail party with a terrific guest list. [22 Mar 1982, p.85]","60","83908"
"7267","The abutting of Conor’s conscious and unconscious states justifies the pullulating images, but the film’s overwrought tone can grate.","60","3416532"
"7268","Screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie's tough-guy dialogue and Bryan Singer's crisp direction give the ensemble cast every opportunity to shine, and they do.","60","114814"
"7269","Freaks is sumptuously produced, admirably directed, and no cost was spared. But Metro failed to realize that even with a different sort of offering the story still is important. Here it is not sufficiently strong to get and hold the interest, partly because interest cannot easily be gained for a too fantastic romance.","60","22913"
"7270","His movie is only partly satisfying. [23 Feb 1996]","60","115012"
"7271","There are just enough laugh-out-loud moments here to excuse the lurches into shameless, tear-jerking sentimentality.","60","2194499"
"7272","Boal's script stirs a little of everything into the pot, which boils down into seven setpieces divided by brief intervals of camaraderie/conflict among the three protags.","60","887912"
"7273","James DeMonaco’s blood-splattered thriller begins well before expiring slowly from multiple improbabilities.","60","2184339"
"7274","A solid, bare-knuckle action-thriller.","60","450232"
"7275","A serious film about the gnawing of conscience and the thirst for redemption, but the tone is so dispassionately vile it may leave viewers shaken or sick. [16 Nov 1992, p.95]","60","103759"
"7276","The main problem is that Burton operates best on a modest scale; saddled with a blockbuster, he doesn't know how to animate all the dead space.","60","96895"
"7277","There's a total absence of personal obsession - even moviemaking obsession - in the way Crichton works; he never excites us emotionally or imaginatively, but the film has a satisfying, tame luxuriousness, like a super episode of ""Masterpiece Theater.""","60","79240"
"7278","His (Crowe) emotionally charged performance stands in contrast to Ryan's annoying, movie-star turn.","60","228750"
"7279","Hoffman has a nice eye for detail, painting an empathetic portrait of lost souls that recalls 1955's still-powerful romance ""Marty.""","60","1278379"
"7280","Witty, wordy, well-acted satire of contemporary class and race relations, based on John Guare's acclaimed stage play.","60","108149"
"7281","First-time writer-director Stephen Chbosky adapts his young-adult bestseller with far more passion than skill, which suits familiar scenes of adolescent awkwardness aptly enough.","60","1659337"
"7282","Jaden Smith takes centre stage in a futuristic rites of passager that plays like an extended episode of The Twilight Zone. Although ""Oblivion"" narrowly remains this summer’s better ruined-Earth actioner.","60","1815862"
"7283","It’s but a shadow of the original and a lesser entry in their (Coens) collection, but you are still blessed by flashes of black heart.","60","335245"
"7284","The bad news is that Pitt, despite this film's high-minded intentions (there are Yo-Yo Ma cello solos on the soundtrack, and China expert Orville Schell acted as an advisor during the shoot), or more likely because of them, finds himself trapped in a long, earnest movie that fails to ever feel very alive.","60","120102"
"7285","There's something about this film's churn of goo and grit that lingers ambivalently, difficult to digest.","60","1349451"
"7286","Michael Chiklis (of the cop show ""The Shield"") steals the movie as the agonized Thing.","60","120667"
"7287","If the shark-versus-Statham bout doesn’t tickle you, the shark-versus-Pekinese sidebar might. Not quite killer, but it’s rare to see a 21st-century blockbuster having this much fun – right through to its sign-off – with its own premise.","60","4779682"
"7288","The movie can -- indeed, should -- be intellectually rejected, but you can't quite banish it from your mind.","60","268978"
"7289","The belly laughs do come, many of them courtesy of the mechanical bird companion.","60","1240982"
"7290","It is a witty, intriguing film in many ways ... But I also feel the film is unsure of how much to disturb its audience, unsure whether to pursue the chaos and embarrassment of a bungled, noir-ish crime and an unsightly psychological disorder, or to contrive something more emollient: to finesse some sympathy and even heroism for the story’s troubled female lead.","60","4682804"
"7291","Big, loud and lurid, but no less entertaining for that.","60","179626"
"7292","This intoxicatingly stylish work is all over the place, a hot mess at times so ravishing it sends shivers down to the toes. Unfortunately, it’s also at times just plain crass and silly.","60","5742374"
"7293","Unfortunately, the script leaves something to be desired--namely, dramatic impetus. Yet Hard Times is still an enjoyable film, and the depression-era settings are painstakingly captured.","60","73092"
"7294","With British-American culture clash as its dominant theme, A Fish Called Wanda bristles with wit, enlivened by delightfully over-the-top ensemble acting.","60","95159"
"7295","This looks, in retrospect, like nothing much more than a glossy soap passed off as serious drama.","60","79417"
"7296","Mid90s possesses just enough sensitivity and feeling to make you wish it had more. Hill’s script aims for, and often achieves, a fleeting, fragmentary portrait of group dynamics, but it’s stymied in its attempts to distinguish Stevie’s pals as individuals rather than types.","60","5613484"
"7297","Hanks and Zemeckis (and writer William Broyles Jr.) are so intent on making an epic of the spirit that they can't bring themselves to acknowledge the comic, narcissistic side of their desert island fantasy. And so on simple, human terms, the picture gets all gummed up.","60","162222"
"7298","On a scene by scene basis, it is mostly great fun but suffers from a contrived script which repetitively drags characters back to the eponymous magical board game for another effect-producing throw of the dice.","60","113497"
"7299","The fun hardens into Fun after he's (Mr. Incredible) lured out of retirement and imprisoned in a remote island compound, though the sleek computer animation is spellbinding as usual.","60","317705"
"7300","More violent, more explosive and even bigger than the original - this ticks all the sequel boxes. But as long as Willis is in his vest and playing McClane, it's hard to care about its shortcomings.","60","99423"
"7301","Okay, it doesn’t have an original bone in its body, but forgetting the awful title, Sex Drive has its share of snappy lines and decent gags. It’s also got Seth Green and James Marsden on cracking form, which should never be underestimated.","60","1135985"
"7302","The background is more intriguing than the stumbling up-front story, and monster watchers will get full use of the freeze-frame facility.","60","100260"
"7303","Everyone who likes this movie calls it ""disturbing,"" but what disturbs me most is the self-loathing laughter it provokes, similar to what one often hears at Woody Allen and Michael Moore comedies.","60","147612"
"7304","Granted, Elysium could be more clever as it goes about its business. This is smart sci-fi, but it's not as smart as it could have been -- or as many ""District 9"" fans were probably hoping it would be.","60","1535108"
"7305","So often not in his element — his turn in “Oz the Great and Powerful” is evidence of that — Franco is in freako mode here, and walks a line between spaced-out caricature and just plain Out There.","60","2101441"
"7306","Power Rangers is good junk.","60","113820"
"7307","From its bland title to its fair-to-middlin' story, mediocre is the word that fits How Do You Know perfectly.","60","1341188"
"7308","A lot of the gags are pretty good. It's not that Star Wars is less worthy of satire than horse opera or gothic horror. It's not that Mel Brooks has lost his cunning, though he does need a freedom of speech not to be found under a PG rating. What's missing is that zany old gang of his. There is simply nobody like them on this trip. [13 July 1987, p.68]","60","94012"
"7309","Although Zach Braff's promising writing-directing debut is a bit affected, few actors with behind-the-camera aspirations succeed as well as the Scrubs star does with this melancholy romantic comedy.","60","333766"
"7310","George Lucas produced and Jim Henson (of Muppets fame) directed this heftily budgeted 1986 fantasy, which seems to be a conscious attempt to play on the female coming-of-age themes of classic fairy tales.","60","91369"
"7311","What makes Stallone a figure to be reckoned with is that although these films can be looked at as sledgehammer mindlessness, they contain not only action, but a mystique of action. For all the blood and thunder, there's a strange stillness at the heart of Stallone. [27 May 1985, p.74]","60","89880"
"7312","A sleazy, seamy, flashy, steamy, vulgar exploitation thriller that revels in every minute of its own trashiness and delivers some pretty solid -- if prurient -- entertainment before strangling in a one-twist-too-many ending.","60","120890"
"7313","Yet it still works like gangbusters - tears will be stifled by the end of the sibling vs. sibling finale - and most of the credit should go to Hardy, Nolte and Edgerton.","60","1291584"
"7314","The result is a film almost too reliant on its players to push it through.","60","2278388"
"7315","Like Hi and Ed, Raising Arizona has a few problems. The repeated slapstick chases and fights are a little wearisome, and the final showdown between Hi and the biker is badly overdrawn, and gratuitously violent in the DePalma- Cronenberg style. Still, there is something appealing about a film that lists ""baby wrangler"" among the credits. And little T. J. Kuhn is liable to start a ""critter boom"" all by his lonesome. [10 Apr 1987, p.1D]","60","93822"
"7316","A disappointingly pedestrian prison meller that falls between stools artistically and politically.","60","272020"
"7317","An admirably unsentimental biopic with an excellent central performance, but it doesn't impact as strongly as it could.","60","454921"
"7318","Once Fletcher starts telling the truth against his will, the movie delivers some perfect laughs.","60","119528"
"7319","All the action is staged with energy, but it gets relentless without anything really funny going on.","60","425112"
"7320","The movie has the same problem as Davis' Chuck Norris vehicle, Code of Silence. Starting in the semi-realistic framework of the '70s cop movies, it veers off into '80s action movie cloud-cuckoo land: the paranoid one-against-a-hundred cliches of the average Schwarzenegger-Stallone heavy-pectoral snow job. [08 Apr 1988, p.14]","60","94602"
"7321","Coming in a few notches below the terror factor of Wan’s most exemplary material, this somewhat less-satisfying variation of an ill-fated haunting nonetheless represents a solid debut for Swedish filmmaker David F. Sandberg","60","4786282"
"7322","Cuaron lets his enthusiasms show.","60","304141"
"7323","Brilliant, in its own twisted way.","60","158983"
"7324","1917 is a noble, failed experiment in breaking the rules.","60","8579674"
"7325","Isn't as dark or sinister as its source material, but it comes closer than any other filmed attempts to this point. It may only be a decent movie, but it's a pretty fine PKD adaptation.","60","405296"
"7326","Ryan Reynolds and Ben Mendelsohn, and their casting in the lead roles pays off in spades. In fact, they're the primary reasons Mississippi Grind works as well as it does.","60","2349144"
"7327","Jones writes herself a couple of powerful scenes and plays them well, but she and director Lee Toland Krieger don't find many memorable uses for Samberg as her blandly schlubby hubby.","60","1405365"
"7328","OK, so Valentine is, like, this new serial-killer movie that totally blows. But kind of in a good way. Like, it's funny.","60","242998"
"7329","Though a lot of it is well written and directed and, quite often, funny or poignant, the individual scenes rarely become part of a larger whole.","60","485947"
"7330","The tragic and highly ""symbolic"" death toward the end, which is supposed to illustrate the sins of the parents being visited upon their children, barely resonates at all, because most of the insights are strictly incidental. The film elicits guilty, lascivious chuckles, not analysis.","60","119349"
"7331","The movie is disappointingly impersonal; it doesn't provide readers of the autobiography anything like a fresh vision of its remarkable subject.","60","104797"
"7332","As robust as the lead performance is, though, the movie around it, directed by Stephen Gaghan from a screenplay by Patrick Massett and John Zinman, too often feels serviceable rather than inspired.","60","1800302"
"7333","Both Rogen and Franco, who have marvellous chemistry and exude good cheer, continue to tweak their personas in this very amusing, very imbecilic film.","60","2788710"
"7334","Kristin Scott Thomas is the film's revelation. She takes center stage as a smart, fearless woman who's utterly irresistible.","60","116209"
"7335","In Parker's hands, Billy's story has become a virtuoso horror show-an exercise in emotional manipulation designed not merely to arouse chills but to turn the audience into avengers. Despite the remarkably controlled, honestly conveyed performance of Davis, Billy finally seems far less vivid than his prison friends-Randy Quaid's highly combustible American roughneck, the superb John Hurt's strung-out English junkie. Parker captures their camaraderie well, but he fails to convey any sense of day-to-day prison life-so keen is he to get to the assaultive highlights. [16 Oct 1978, p.76]","60","77928"
"7336","More amusing than annoying. It is not as maniacally uninhibited as ""Old School"" or as dementedly lovable as ""Elf,"" but its cheerful dumbness is hard to resist.","60","357413"
"7337","It's a lot more tightly focused than the first outing, and for fans of the demented comedy of Elliott and Cross, or the thespian chops of Woods (a last-minute replacement for an ailing Marlon Brando), it's worth putting up with humor that's the filmic equivalent of a big, spit-soaked raspberry.","60","257106"
"7338","The plot becomes landlocked in true-life implausibilities; the characters rarely get a hold on the moviegoer's heart or lapels. What saves this meditation on the vestiges of colonialism is, ironically, its celebration of American star power.","60","86617"
"7339","Personally, I reckon that Portman tips Vox Lux off balance. The simple act of drinking through a straw is turned into an embarrassing megaslurp.","60","5960374"
"7340","Spacey and Bridges -- generally provide exactly the level of investment required for their characters to be convincing. Neither one showboats, and both make good use of the dry humor in Leavitt's script.","60","272152"
"7341","The action IS pretty engaging, Sao Feng and his gang of South Asian cutthroats are a nice addition, and the constant plot explication does require you to pay attention.","60","449088"
"7342","An affectionate send-up of schlocky 1950s monster pics, but with better special effects, Tremors has a few clever twists but ultimately can’t decide what it wants to be – flat-out funny, which it’s not, or a scarefest.","60","100814"
"7343","What Woman in Gold has over nonfiction portrayals is emotion, and director Simon Curtis (My Week With Marilyn) milks every scene for its heart-tugging potential.","60","2404425"
"7344","The action sequences here are armrest-gripping fun, and you only wish DeBlois and his animators had been even more confident; held their shots even longer; allowed us to enjoy the whistle of the wind and the curve of the dragons’ flight paths without hurriedly cutting away to another angle, and another, and another. When the film flies, it soars.","60","1646971"
"7345","Mr. Feig handily manages the mood and scene shifts, using regular laughs to brighten the deepening dark. By far his smartest move was to give Ms. Kendrick and Ms. Lively room to create a prickly intimacy for their characters, a bond that’s persuasive enough to push the story through its more forced moments.","60","7040874"
"7346","Even as you're wincing at what you thought was misguided earnestness, it's being subverted by filmmakers who've turned many of the genre's weaknesses into tiny triumphs.","60","144814"
"7347","Frankel has cut, pasted and rejiggered the novel, mostly for the better. As adapted by Aline Brosh McKenna, The Devil Wears Prada is crisper, less self-righteous and mercifully shorter than its intermittently funny but interminable source.","60","458352"
"7348","It’s a decent tennis movie, solidly told and choreographed, but it’s in the film’s depiction of a same-sex romance between King and her hairdresser, played beautifully by Andrea Riseborough, where things truly comes alive.","60","4622512"
"7349","This isn't merely a horror film about things going bump in the night, but a study of the effects of desolation on our sense of personal consciousness.","60","486051"
"7350","Whether it’s the scene-setting blast of Donovan (“Zodiac”), the low-height Steadicam work (“The Shining”), the red-suffused hallways (David Lynch) or “Night of the Living Dead” playing at a drive-in, the movie takes from the best.","60","3387520"
"7351","Four powerhouse performances cannot quite make Richard Linklater's occasionally moving dramedy, Last Flag Flying, into more than a minor war movie.","60","6018306"
"7352","Hey, it's not ""Gone With the Wind"" or even ""Nightmare on Elm Street"", so don't expect a masterpiece. You get a little nudity, a lot of gore, Seth Green doing his ironic commentary thing, and an easy way to kill a couple of hours.","60","138510"
"7353","You could say this is all good gory fun, and The Evil Dead remains a triumph of brains over budget. But in retrospect, you can’t help wondering if Raimi and co didn’t have some women issues to work through?","60","83907"
"7354","It makes for a patchy comedy that's stronger as a genre-mocker than a political satire.","60","372588"
"7355","Notorious settles into a curious comfort zone; it's half pop fable, half naturalistic docudrama. Not a bad movie, but nowhere near as strong as its soundtrack.","60","472198"
"7356","After the taut and troubling Unforgiven, Clint Eastwood's A Perfect World feels like a breather. As usual, you can expect solid, no-fuss craftsmanship, but it's best to set your expectations down a notch.","60","107808"
"7357","This might be as perfect a new-millennium Halloween creepshow as we can expect.","60","245674"
"7358","A certain amount of work is required to stitch together a sense of the plot, but as is often the case in Zulawski’s films, the story is less the point than an excuse, a loose temporal conceit holding together flights of visual invention, verbal extravagance and male and female nudity.","60","93593"
"7359","Like a relatively dark street on Halloween night, Trick or Treat is ripe for howls and hoots, but only manages to deliver a choice handful of them when the festivities are just about over.","60","92112"
"7360","Laboring under the handicaps of a contrived script, an uncertain approach and personalities in essence playing themselves, the production never quite makes its point, but romps along merrily unconcerned that it doesn't.","60","54135"
"7361","At times the relentless special effects and tangled plotting veer towards visual and narrative overkill, but the final tonal swerve is shocking and effective.","60","116365"
"7362","The script is weak and obvious and the direction disappointingly unimaginative. But stars are stars, and the old boys are terrific - enough to make this a funny and sometimes moving buddy picture.","60","825232"
"7363","The movie is, as these things go, enjoyably trashy.","60","1148204"
"7364","Director Chris Columbus has pasted the grungy ""La Boheme"" update onto film with slavish respect for the original material but a shortage of stylistic imagination and raw emotions.","60","294870"
"7365","As in all fiercely realistic thrillers, the action becomes less and less credible as it speeds on. But, as with some such thrillers, we tolerate the incredible as the price of the pulse-quickening.","60","118972"
"7366","Kids will understand this stuff. If you can remember your younger, goofier roots, so will you. Sandlot isn't well made but it's alive with dopey, summertime spirit.","60","108037"
"7367","I cannot remember a moment in this new film that compares, simply in directorial originality, to the work in ""Schindler's List.""","60","408306"
"7368","What ultimately is so distressing about The Last Boy Scout is that, despite its loathsome attitude, it is an outstanding action thriller. It sets its sights a hair above the gutter and hits bullseye every time. [13 Dec 1991, p.5]","60","102266"
"7369","Oldman and Seyfried prove to be the big attractions, but Hardwicke's Riding Hood legend still lacks bite.","60","1486185"
"7370","The film's good points, though, are marred by a slow start and a nerve-jangling soundtrack.","60","1187043"
"7371","In a world filled with crude movie sitcoms, Berg's bitter, worst-possible-case scenario really does stand alone.","60","124198"
"7372","Besson's restored Big Blue proves mystical, intriguing.","60","95250"
"7373","My Cousin Vinny is a mildly entertaining courtroom comedy that ultimately must be judged guilty of disappointment. Lynn and Launer's pop-movie mentality wastes a great idea and some terrific performances. [13 Mar 1992, p.10]","60","104952"
"7374","A half-baked love story, full of good intentions but uneven in the telling.","60","98258"
"7375","This kind of movie is superfluous yet strangely compelling. We don't need to see Daniel Day-Lewis and Nicole Kidman sing a duet next to a Roman fountain any more than we need to see an elephant pirouette in a tutu, but wouldn't you be crazy to pass up the opportunity to see either?","60","875034"
"7376","Audiences will be confused by what the picture is not. It’s not really about Cobb or baseball or a bygone era. It’s neither character study nor historic drama. It’s ambitious but oblique and unfocused, and only the most generous of viewers will forgive its numerous lapses and vagaries. The film’s prospects of breaking out of a specialized niche are remote.","60","109450"
"7377","(Cage's) performance feels embalmed in the accumulated shtick of an actor trapped in excess.","60","163988"
"7378","Black Rain is chock-full of moments, jazzy scenery and snazzy bits of dialogue, and stuffed with steroids. It's big, maybe too big for its shallow notions and commonplace structure. But it is also beautiful and terrible in the same ways that other Scott movies have been eye-filling. With its teeming Asian landscape, its dark kaleidoscopic palette and its heavily layered composition, it's reminiscent of Blade Runner. But this is an atmosphere that needs Sam Spade, not Dirty Harry.","60","96933"
"7379","Mary Stuart Masterson, a delicate blond, steals the show as the sensitive gal under the tomboy's leather jacket, her natural magnetism offsetting the story's predictability.","60","94006"
"7380","When you add it all up, Only Angels Have Wings comes to an overly familiar total. It's a fairly good melodrama, nothing more.","60","31762"
"7381","Sometimes hilarious, occasionally outrageous and terribly uneven.","60","815236"
"7382","There's nothing beyond the bloodshed and gallows humor, just intellectually secondhand implications about materialism, conformity and misogyny.","60","144084"
"7383","A not-bad futuristic actioner with three or four astounding sequences, an unusual hero, a nifty villain and less mythic and romantic resonance than might be desired.","60","114898"
"7384","Top Gun is basically ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" with less spirit and depth. But it's still fine formula movie-making -- like a feature-length ""Be All That You Can Be"" commercial. It's got lots of loud music, hot colors, heat-seeking missiles and other pointed objects. Real men squint into the radar's gleam below deck, while real men hunt MiGs upstairs. [16 May 1986, p.29]","60","92099"
"7385","As with all Stephen King stories, there are resonant universal themes running through Pet Sematary; guilt, grief and trauma fuel this tale of a family who move to the countryside and become embroiled with an ancient evil. Yet these are buried deep under a mudslide of horror cliches — jump scares, creepy kids, expositional newspaper headlines — that reduce this to just another run-of-the-mill horror remake.","60","837563"
"7386","Performances are good but not career best.","60","308383"
"7387","This is an attempt to be both a high-octane actionfest and a satire on such films, the result of which is the weirdest concoction: the metaphysical blockbuster. No wonder it tanked.","60","107362"
"7388","It’s a heavy meal to digest, but this is a strong, vehement film with a real sense of time and place.","60","385887"
"7389","The overlapping dialogue and the comedy of famous people playing self-variations is pure Altman (Leigh, not surprisingly, has worked in three Altman films).","60","254099"
"7390","Part ""Evil Dead,"" part ""The Truman Show,"" part ""Arthur Christmas""... For horror hounds who love a larf, and those of us who always wondered exactly what that dry-ice stuff that rises out of the forest-floor moss is. A fun ride - but not quite a ""Scream.""","60","1259521"
"7391","Wan’s film is a sturdily built supernatural chiller, with next-to-no digital effects or gore, and it delivers its scares with a breezy lack of urgency.","60","1457767"
"7392","His (Ross) sophisticated handling -- and the efforts of his able cast, notably the stellar Joan Allen -- produces a surprisingly accomplished cumulative effect.","60","120789"
"7393","Other than ludicrously pulpy fun, Anonymous, true to its title, ultimately signifies nothing.","60","1521197"
"7394","Though Iron Man is diverting enough in the comic-book-movie mode, there is one thing it doesn't have, and that is dramatic unity. Unlike the irreducible element that is its namesake, Iron Man the movie is an alloy, a combination of several different and disconnected components that don't manage to unite to make a coherent whole.","60","371746"
"7395","It's clear this movie is for a certain audience, but at least the film embraces its genre and the jokes stick the landing. It's definitely worth a watch for fans of movies with an early 2000s rom-com aesthetic.","60","2126357"
"7396","Ridley Scott has counter-evolved his 1979 classic Alien into something more grandiose, more elaborate – but less interesting. In place of scariness there is wonderment; in place of tension there is hugely ambitious design; in place of unforgettable shocks there are reminders of the original's unforgettable shocks.","60","1446714"
"7397","Ready Player One isn’t slick enough a commentary worth getting riled up about or distracting enough to hide glaring structural issues underneath a barrage of “HEY I KNOW THEM!” cameos like dangling keys in front of a dog.","60","1677720"
"7398","Redford delivers a tour de force performance: holding the screen effortlessly with no acting support whatsoever.","60","2017038"
"7399","This is a mother's tale, and in Swinton's expert hands, Eva must ultimately deal with the fallout from an uncomfortable truth: She just never liked her kid.","60","1242460"
"7400","Harriet has the best intentions, but despite a powerful lead performance by Cynthia Erivo, the film feels bereft of originality. It’s a shame that a film centering a woman whose life was filled with fear, risk, and compassion couldn’t summon those same elements for its story.","60","4648786"
"7401","Chaganty’s tab-toggling is pacy enough, but he gets pedantic about tying up unfinished digital business, and Unfriended’s pulse-raising wildness is beyond him.","60","7668870"
"7402","Competent and well-cast, but it crams too much into the runtime and loses the elegance of the novel.","60","452694"
"7403","The total effect is fast and attractive and occasionally amusing. Like a good hot dog, that's something of an achievement in a field where unpalatable junk is the rule.","60","80684"
"7404","It's not the plot that disappoints, it's the poor dialogue between action sequences. Sadly another film to file under not as good as the book.","60","67525"
"7405","The plot material isn't as strong as in the first two movies--if anything, it feels a bit desperate--but the anti-Disney joke blunderbuss remains in good working order.","60","413267"
"7406","The movie wouldn’t stand for much of anything without such an effective team to represent the equivocating.","60","2431286"
"7407","Eastwood hits all the right notes in exactly the right order, but it’s his least personal film for a while.","60","1057500"
"7408","For all its visual sweep and propulsively violent action, this bloodthirsty rendition of the Old English epic can't overcome the disadvantage of being enacted by digital waxworks rather than flesh-and-blood Danes and demons.","60","442933"
"7409","Everett overdoes the lachrymosity right at the end, the one part of the film where a more subdued rigour would have served him better. At the very least, though, it’s a command performance he puts in front of us, an uncompromising feat of empathy in the role he’s made his own more than any other.","60","2404639"
"7410","Ben Kingsley, who plays the Mahatma, looks the part, has a fine, quiet presence, and conveys Gandhi's shrewdness. Kingsley is impressive; the picture isn't.","60","83987"
"7411","Avatar clears the hurdle in terms of being optical candy. Its story, though, is pure cheese.","60","499549"
"7412","The movie's not built for belief. It's built for dumb, shivery, sexed-up pleasure, and it delivers, albeit somewhat modestly.","60","3181822"
"7413","Mission: Impossible proves something of a letdown, not just because it's fairly easy to guess who the bad guy is but also because we've hardly gotten to know anyone in the movie well enough to become more than superficially involved with them.","60","117060"
"7414","While this is no quick-witted treat on a par with Mr. Levinson's ''Wag the Dog,'' it's a solid thriller with showy scientific overtones.","60","120184"
"7415","Grungily stylish and often funny, at least for a while, though all of the caveats and contradictions that apply to Tarantino films apply here: One man's--or boy's--stylization is another's profane, unrelenting and tedious brutality.","60","1250777"
"7416","Makes one interested in seeing the inevitable sequel, but one is also left to somewhat question the worth of sitting through this first installment.","60","258463"
"7417","There are smart moments of fear and subliminal shivers of disquiet, the dance sequences are good and of course Guadagnino could never be anything other than an intelligent film-maker. But this is a weirdly passionless film.","60","1034415"
"7418","Gibson simply turns his signature righteous rage into a crushing inward sorrow-Sad Max?-and Foster boldly plays everything straight, rendering her actor's unnerving turn to mania (and a pitch-black third act) with zero tongue-in-cheek.","60","1321860"
"7419","King Kong isn't terrible, but it's something that none of Jackson's previous movies ever was -- it's enervating.","60","360717"
"7420","Relentless, infantile and impossible to dislike.","60","306685"
"7421","The supporting cast is flawless, with a special mention owed to Brad Dourif as poor, doomed Billy Bibbit. But the script lacks the woozy, otherworldly subtlety of Kesey’s book, relying instead on pop psychology and finger-pointing: once again, it turns out women are to blame for pretty much everything.","60","73486"
"7422","Luckily, Son of Rambow, a comedy that's part kid-buddy flick, part valentine to filmmaking - and full of heart - has both.","60","845046"
"7423","For better or for worse the movie belongs to Sheen, who does manage to generate enough intensity to hold writer-director David Twohy's unwieldy story together. [31 May 1996, p.D6]","60","115571"
"7424","If we can watch this picture at all, it is because this universally admired person (Eastwood) is in it.","60","405159"
"7425","The bad news is that if you haven't seen ""Thor,"" ""Captain America"" and ""Iron Man 2"" - that's six hours and three minutes of homework - The Avengers won't make sense. The good news is if you're a human under the age of 45, you probably already have.","60","848228"
"7426","A mess of a gay best friend, played brilliantly by Richard E. Grant in what is easily one of the year’s most enjoyable supporting performances. He steals every scene he’s in, injecting the film with a needed dose of lovability that carries it through its narrative lulls.","60","4595882"
"7427","Fans of the original won't be disappointed, but ultimately it's just another decent, arguably unnecessary, '70s horror remake.","60","454841"
"7428","But even as the film's weaknesses make themselves more and more apparent, so does Mr. Turturro's virtuosity. [15 Aug 1991, p.A10(E)]","60","101410"
"7429","Stylish, exciting and an occasionally poignant sci-fi adventure spectacle.","60","120903"
"7430","No one will mistake this for Quality Cinema, and it's marred by a confusing, murky ending. But there are some good thrills along the way.","60","82418"
"7431","The story of course has some lovely and wild ideas—men of straw and tin, a cowardly lion, a wizard who isn’t a very good wizard—but the picture doesn’t know what to do with them, except to be painfully literal and elaborate about everything.","60","32138"
"7432","It’s a goofy, drunken scrap of escapism and while the romantic comedy is not fully back, despite think pieces assuring us that it is, Palm Springs energetically reminds us, yet again, that it’s never really going away.","60","9484998"
"7433","Proving that a comedy’s performers are sometimes more important than its jokes, this remake of Frank Oz’s dreary 2007 British farce of the same name livens up the proceedings by subbing in a comic African-American all-star cast.","60","1321509"
"7434","Wahlberg is surprisingly committed to the ridiculousness.","60","1386588"
"7435","Michael Fassbender (Fishtank, Inglourious Basterds) is reliably great, severely outclassing costar Knightley's grating performance.","60","1571222"
"7436","Has the grace to send the audience out with a piece of Waters-written rap.","60","173716"
"7437","True torture-porn aficionados will be disappointed, as editor Tariq Anwar cuts away right before blade meets flesh -- a move that feels a tad, well, gutless under the circumstances. But elsewhere, ""Citizen"" proves startlingly graphic, even by R-rated standards.","60","1197624"
"7438","It's nothing we haven't seen done better before (by Paul Greengrass in the recent ""Bourne Ultimatum,"" for instance), but it's good enough as kinetic entertainment.","60","800080"
"7439","Oldboy has the fatal air of wanting so desperately to be a cult movie that it forgets to present itself as a coherent one.","60","364569"
"7440","It’s an entertaining spectacle but the brilliant tonal balance in something like Jordan Peele’s satire Get Out leaves this looking a little exposed. Yet it responds fiercely, contemptuously to the crassness at the heart of the Trump regime and gleefully pays it back in its own coin.","60","7349662"
"7441","The film's message may be a clichéd staple of comic books - with great power comes great responsibility - but it's handled with sincerity and skill.","60","81573"
"7442","Whannell’s finite reserves of creativity have been meted out in an imbalance, going all in on world-building while giving the fight choreography and the cinematography listlessly documenting it the short shrift.","60","6499752"
"7443","A watchable enough picture that feels content to realize someone else's vision rather than claim it as its own. Any real sense of risk has been carefully ironed out: The PG-13 rating that ensures the film's suitability for its target audience also blunts the impact of the teen-on-teen bloodshed.","60","1392170"
"7444","he entire cast speaks in horribly intrusive American accents, but Forman makes some perceptive connections between Mozart's life and work.","60","86879"
"7445","A B-movie with flair.","60","88247"
"7446","Ritchie whisks you along on a whirlwind tour, but he's not averse to putting on the brakes long enough to admire some of his favorite attractions.","60","1032755"
"7447","You don't have to be Jewish to love Jonathan Kesselman's uneven, profane and occasionally flat-out hilarious parody of vintage blaxploitation pictures, but it helps.","60","317640"
"7448","It's no soap opera: it's serious, unsentimental and novelistic in its preference for anecdotal detail over melodramatic plotting and filled with fresh, acute and moving moments. Shoot the Moon can also boast of excellent performances and Parker's most controlled direction to date. Yet these many virtues don't add up to a completely satisfying film. [25 Jan 1982, p.75]","60","84675"
"7449","Don't go in expecting scares so much as laughs. Scream 4 is a better ""Scary Movie"" than any of the ""Scary Movies"" ever were, from its inventively gut-busting kills (watch out for that mail slot!) to the unintentionally humorous sight of the three leads acting as if they're in three separate films.","60","1262416"
"7450","It's technologically more advanced, far more thrilling and there's infinitely more dinos per minute.","60","119567"
"7451","An attempt to infuse an earnest piece of comicbook lore with an irreverent, tongue-in-cheek sensibility yields decidedly mixed results in Green Lantern.","60","1133985"
"7452","Though the tale demands a darker outcome, the director disappointingly goes the Mouse House happy-ending route with a reprise of the original short film's finale - one that somehow plays with even more cringeworthy sentimentality.","60","1142977"
"7453","You have to admire it, when so much of the competition seems inane and slack, but you can’t help wondering, with some impatience, what happened to its heart.","60","783233"
"7454","For all its visual delights, however, Coraline remains more an engaging spectacle than a connective drama. That is chiefly because of the writing. Director-writer Henry Selick doesn't reach for the kind of universality that would enrich the movie.","60","327597"
"7455","The script by New Line's head of production, Michael de Luca, does not allow Carpenter free range, nevertheless he manages some neat flourishes of his own, handling the narrative twists and unsettling sfx sequences with customary skill.","60","113409"
"7456","The most pleasant surprise in the movie adaptation of ""Watchmen"" is the pop-art fusion set off by placing superheroes in a ""real"" world. The film's biggest challenge – and accomplishment – was making that plausible.","60","409459"
"7457","The movie is fascinating in its approach to legal arguments, forensic evidence, and the uses and abuses of history — but, like the courtroom at its center, it doesn't have much feel for the feels.","60","4645330"
"7458","Africa might have been another Gone With the Wind, blown by passion and buffeted by social upheaval. But in the end it's like a trip to a game park called Extinction. [20 Dec 1985, p.C1]","60","89755"
"7459","These late scenes are over the top, as mean and reductive as editorials in a tabloid, and they nearly extinguish the moral subtlety of what's gone before.","60","118749"
"7460","Its dread has no resonance; it’s a hermetically sealed creep-out that turns into a fake-trippy experience. By all means, go to mother! and enjoy its roller-coaster-of-weird exhibitionism. But be afraid, very afraid, only if you’re hoping to see a movie that’s as honestly disquieting as it is showy.","60","5109784"
"7461","A middlebrow domestic drama beating its wings against an experimental frame.","60","1084950"
"7462","This same film, shot for shot, line for line, could have been much more solid and engrossing, much farther up the Parnassian slope, with a better actor as Hughes.","60","338751"
"7463","While the severity of the film’s environment convinces, the specifics of Amy Fox’s screenplay — tangled up in tech IPOs, post-Snowden security paranoia and venal investment banking practice — are less consistently persuasive.","60","3958780"
"7464","An exhaustingly elaborate romantic fantasy actioner.","60","356910"
"7465","Not so good is the absence of hip cross-references to the classic horror tropes.","60","134084"
"7466","Gorgeously realised, gripping and doused in De Palma’s familiar technical wizardry, this is only let down by the director’s equally familiar uninterest in the humanity of his characters.","60","387877"
"7467","Bemused out of the ring and brutal in it, Rocky has always been an uncomfortable hero, and it says something for Stallone's skill as a writer that he's been able to keep him going this long. Given the restrictions of the formula, Rocky V is a fitting — even graceful — way to finally hang up the gloves.","60","100507"
"7468","The movie is almost exactly what you’d expect: It has stirring speeches, infuriating setbacks and a tendency to overstate the obvious.","60","4916630"
"7469","The garish, exotic, retro styling is Anderson at his visual best. In terms of character and sensibility, though, this is sadly Anderson at his worst.","60","362270"
"7470","A reminder of why Bullock became a movie star in the first place.","60","191754"
"7471","Tomorrow is propelled by relentless action. Chase scenes are interrupted not by witty conversation or sexy conquests but by the rattle of machine gun fire.","60","120347"
"7472","Like the ""Scream"" series, Hot Tub Time Machine is a cake-and-eat-it-too experience; you get both a vintage Brat Pack comedy, albeit one regrettably drenched in post-Hangover raunch, and an ongoing metacommentary at the same time.","60","1231587"
"7473","Those who haven’t seen “Lock, Stock” will probably get a bigger kick out of Snatch than those who have. The second time around, what seemed spontaneous can sometimes feel strained.","60","208092"
"7474","Also helping to sell it all is the fact that these films, goofy though they may be, feature a consistently high level of acting. In addition to Pegg, we get Martin Freeman (""The Hobbit""), Paddy Considine (""Red Riding""), Eddie Marsan (""Sherlock Holmes"") and Bill Nighy (""Love Actually""), all of whom have appeared previously in the trilogy.","60","1213663"
"7475","Boorman is both a romantic and a realist, an idealist and a skeptic, and Excalibur is an impressive but uneasy attempt to marry these opposites. [13 April 1981, p.82]","60","82348"
"7476","A frothy, innocuous smorgasbord of girlhood wish fulfillment that scores a direct hit with its target demo.","60","1067774"
"7477","Rendering all of its materials with a self-protective tongue-in-cheek tone, Star Wars is fun. But if the movie appeals to the child in all of us, it also may seem to the adult within a good deal less delightful. There's something depressing about seeing all these impressive cinematic gifts and all this extraordinary technological skills lavished on such puerile materials.","60","76759"
"7478","It's more a brave movie than it is a good one, but at least Singleton has faced the unknown. And he deserves credit for the attempt.","60","107840"
"7479","Christopher Nolan's latest exploration of the Batman mythology steeps its muddled plot in so much murk that the Joker's maniacal nihilism comes to seem like a recurrent grace note.","60","468569"
"7480","In Insomnia, the crunch comes as the hero and his opposite number hook up on a ferry, to discuss what each of them knows about the other. This should be Nolan's big moment, his answer to that quiet, magnificent interlude in Michael Mann's ""Heat,"" when Pacino met De Niro in a coffee shop. -- But Williams and Pacino just don't mesh. [27 May 2002, p.124]","60","278504"
"7481","There's a lot to be said for it as a fast-moving, urbane entertainment in the comedy-mystery vein.","60","56923"
"7482","Terminator Salvation is one of the most visually impressive films in the series. The action is non-stop and the look borders on dazzling.... But ironically for a series that's supposed to be about an embattled humanity struggling against those who lack it, there isn't an emotional moment in this.","60","438488"
"7483","A less muddled, less self-conscious Queen & Slim could have been an indelible waking dream. Instead, it's hit-and-miss. But Waithe and Matsoukas are on to something, and it's the undercurrents rather than the filmmakers' more obvious exertions that hit the mark.","60","8722346"
"7484","Missing is most of Tarkovsky's contemplative and mystical poetry (which is why it's 90 minutes shorter), and added are some unfortunate Hollywood-style designer flashbacks -- The story is still strong and haunting, but I'd recommend seeing this, if at all, only after the Tarkovsky.","60","307479"
"7485","For very much like Peter, it has clearly gotten harder for this director to break free of the lure of material things and believe in simple magic. And whatever problems his Hook has, there are none that making the film on half of its budget wouldn't have cured.","60","102057"
"7486","The film often rings hollow.","60","8291806"
"7487","For all the film’s merits, the suspicion persists that McDonagh’s a little too pleased with his own fulminating thesis. Time and again the writing is showing off for effect, delivering a fire-and-brimstone sermon with cocky swagger.","60","2234003"
"7488","Unfolds as a series of meticulous tableaux vivants, but like those parlor pastimes, it lacks physical verve and a compelling emotional charge.","60","335119"
"7489","There is a contrivance to both story and script that grates, rubs up against Murray’s appeal as a loose cannon.","60","2170593"
"7490","A visually inventive, deliciously dark fairytale reheat. The story's far from the stuff of legend, but Theron makes for a ferocious meanie, helping to flush away ""Mirror Mirror's"" sugary aftertaste.","60","1735898"
"7491","Somewhat preposterous but fairly watchable mystery thriller. The plot gets so convoluted and farfetched that you still may be scratching your head after the denouement, but you probably won't be bored.","60","109456"
"7492","Abetted by the piercing images of lenser Christopher Doyle, the picture has a vivid, nightmarish quality that's more inviting than repellent. But the filmmaker mutes the impact by repeatedly cutting away to other settings, as if he lacked confidence in the power of the moment.","60","112913"
"7493","Hoffman, Morton and Jon Brion's aching score somehow capture the all-too-human need to get things right. If you're in a certain frame of mind, those moments make up for all the stagecraft.","60","383028"
"7494","Howard, whose previous tales of men in professional peril include the topnotch “Apollo 13” as well as “Backdraft” and “Cinderella Man,” works with cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle to create a style in the racing scenes that makes the most of every angle. By the time the final lap of Rush starts, we’re up for the ride.","60","1979320"
"7495","Creepy, beautifully designed horror yarn about mutant roaches that delivers both artfully eerie atmosphere and some boffo shocks.","60","119675"
"7496","Mostly it gets by on being good-natured enough for you to accept its being clumsy and padded and only borderline entertaining.","60","93260"
"7497","A generic suspenser that doesn't taste bad at first bite but becomes increasingly hard to swallow, The Saint comes off more as a pallid imitation of Paramount's Eurothriller ""Mission: Impossible"" than as anything resembling the further adventures of Leslie Charteris' charming rogue.","60","120053"
"7498","The script may feature numerous wobbly passages in which everyone eerily states precisely what they are thinking (an unfortunate tradition that runs throughout the series) but if anyone can sell it, it’s Stallone and Jordan.","60","3076658"
"7499","For those looking for the rare romantic youth drama without vampyric overtones or other gimmicks, Remember Me should satisfy and it works as a much-needed change of pace for the talented Pattinson who remains one of the most watchable of our young stars.","60","1403981"
"7500","The best of the sequels to Carpenter's seminal slasher movie...Directed with flair by Little, who does not blatantly ape Carpenter's style, the movie delivers a number of effective chills without relying too heavily on the kinds of tired tricks and bloody gore that have made this genre a boring cliche.","60","95271"
"7501","Packed high with explosive action and loaded with high-stakes jeopardy, Con Air charts a generally sound narrative course, although it hits some story turbulence before it hits its climactic jackpot.","60","118880"
"7502","Well-shot thriller but with a weak performance from Beatty.","60","71970"
"7503","The problem is that the motion picture around these individual stunts is patently a committee-made artifact.","60","120755"
"7504","The result is his (Shyamalan's) most meditative and lovingly rendered offering thus far, if also his least fun.","60","368447"
"7505","Directed in bold, energetic strokes by Taylor Hackford, ""Devil"" is fine disreputable fun at first, a stylish and watchable hoot. But then its tone changes, the plot goes gimmicky and bombastic speeches about the nature of good and evil clutter the airwaves and confuse the issue.","60","118971"
"7506","Low on narrative drive, and marred by a misjudged final-act swerve into extravagant whimsy, Nicholas Hytner’s amiable luvvie-fest is enlivened by Smith’s signature irascibility.","60","3722070"
"7507","The film becomes so much urgent nonsense, its killing spree neither cheaply thrilling nor even more cheaply cathartic. It's only gory.","60","164052"
"7508","The genial humor is occasionally marred by an overall sexist tone and some downright nasty homophobic and racist attempts at humor.","60","117802"
"7509","If you can cast all semblance of logic aside, it's sort of fun.","60","337921"
"7510","As compelling as Misery often is, I can't say that I really enjoyed it a whole lot. It's too flat-footed and vise-like. Reiner doesn't provide the kind of nasty, sophisticated finesse that might have lifted the film out of pulpdom and into more Hitchcockian terrain. [30 Nov 1990, p.F1]","60","100157"
"7511","Mr. Nichols decided to preserve the jokiness of the original material, even while shifting the emphasis to the mother-daughter conflict. There may have been a way to do this and end up with a clever movie, but Mr. Nichols seems to have had an even cleverer idea: He decided to use this movie as a way to pay back social obligations. [13 Sep 1990, p.A14]","60","100395"
"7512","Isn’t a bad film, simply an unspectacular one, which might be a more damaging statement.","60","332452"
"7513","The action and humor are enough to make an hour and a half pass quickly and pleasantly.","60","266915"
"7514","Scottish comedian Billy Connolly shows ample ability in the role, but he can't locate much charm in the character.","60","119280"
"7515","Danny Huston is screamingly funny as the alternately finicky and savage Head Ghoul--he’s like something spewed forth from the bowels of the Politburo. The problem is structural.","60","389722"
"7516","Like the television medium it genially satirizes, EDtv is a grab bag that's both amusing and frustrating.","60","131369"
"7517","Director Rob Cohen has pulled together a simple yarn of an itinerant dragonslayer who decides to team with his prey to rid the land of an evil ruler who has betrayed them both. Tale’s poignancy stems from the fact that fire-breathing, armor-plated, high-flying creature is the last of its kind; when he dies, dragons will have passed entirely from Earth.","60","116136"
"7518","The problem is that almost everything here looks like route one scary-movie stuff that we have seen before: scary clowns, scary old houses, scary bathrooms. In their differing ways, Brian De Palma and Stanley Kubrick were inspired by the potency of King’s source material to create something virulently distinctive and original. This film’s director, Andy Muschietti, can’t manage quite as much.","60","1396484"
"7519","Another 'nice' Sandler comedy that works, thanks to some smart and genuinely moving ideas at its core.","60","389860"
"7520","Face the Music is clearly a passion project for the minds behind Bill & Ted, and it results in a sequel that coasts by on its goofy humor and heart.","60","1086064"
"7521","This inconsistency of direction is the most obvious fault of Bonnie and Clyde, which has some good ingredients, although they are not meshed together well.","60","61418"
"7522","But it's Lopez's movie, and its limitations are hers: Both actress and movie tackle emotional turmoil with a minimum of insight.","60","225071"
"7523","The performances are alright enough but the casting was a bizarre choice and it's just not strong enough to carry the premise.","60","107211"
"7524","The movie looks great, never lags, and keeps us intrigued throughout. It's not until the high wears off that we realize we've just been had.","60","1219289"
"7525","The movie is, for a good stretch, a troubling and arresting character study, one done with nervy conviction. Eventually, though, Phillips has to more tightly attach this downward spiral to the larger Gotham mythology, which is where the provocative ambivalence of the film gives way to veneration.","60","7286456"
"7526","Here's a popcorn movie with soul, welcoming the masses to consider how much can change in popular culture over 30 years, as the horrific becomes the familiar.","60","204313"
"7527","The action is mostly brisk and bracing and the battleground, particularly Cobra's headquarters -- a vast network of tunnels under the polar ice cap -- are wonderfully imagined, as are the futuristic machines at the Joes' disposal. Basically, the Joes are not bad, it's just that they could have been much better with a little less conversation, a little more action.","60","1046173"
"7528","Natali's film has a fabulous look, a nerve-wracking, claustrophobic mood, a number of genuinely suspenseful set-pieces and some sublimely stomach-churning special effects.","60","123755"
"7529","Pegg has some good obnoxious moments, but he's only a few movies away from becoming Dudley Moore.","60","455538"
"7530","At best, I Love You Phillip Morris may be hailed as a necessary step in Hollywood's fearful crawl toward sexual evenhandedness; the film upholds the constitutional right of every gay man to be as much of a liar, a crook, and a creep as the rest of us. Makes you proud.","60","1045772"
"7531","It makes its argument against gay conversion therapy — a form of torture usually rooted in the self-loathing of the so-called therapist — persuasively. And it is dramatically impressive most of the time, but it is also very messy and uneven.","60","7008872"
"7532","For all its calculation and manipulation, there's a very human movie somewhere within Marigold Hotel. You might just have to wade through a thousand clichés to get to it.","60","1412386"
"7533","The energy never flags, the film conveys a deep love of Brown’s music (which fills almost every scene), and Boseman remains magnetic whether onstage or in quiet moments.","60","2473602"
"7534","Had the writing matched their performances, Fried Green Tomatoes would be this year's Driving Miss Daisy. As it is, it's an absorbing period mystery and a hapless social comedy. Half of it works. [24 Jan 1992, p.28","60","101921"
"7535","E.T. is a dog movie. Genre-wise, I mean. It's about a boy meeting a dog, naming it, taming it, learning from it, and growing up. Of course, the genre is superficially disguised as science fiction, as was the fashion at the time. [2002 re-release]","60","83866"
"7536","Swank’s moving performance, the period dressing and beautiful planes all appeal, but dramatically it doesn’t really soar.","60","1129445"
"7537","The film's sure-to-be-brief theatrical release is a mere stopover on the way to basic-cable eternity.","60","1265990"
"7538","A one-joke comedy written and directed by an older, gentler John Waters, the film gets an enormous boost from Kathleen Turner's puckish portrayal of Beverly Sutphin.","60","111127"
"7539","If you're amused by jokes involving male genitals, female pubic hair, flatulence and dismemberment, it should be a big hit.","60","175142"
"7540","The end of the movie goes completely off the rails, but in a way that is charming in its stupidity.","60","2872732"
"7541","I wanted to be transported by this movie; I wasn't quite. But I respect it.","60","119485"
"7542","It's all a little too coincidental for comfort, and surprisingly short on laughs for a comedy, but nonetheless this is a light, well-meaning flick, improved considerably by Lake's scatty heroine.","60","117104"
"7543","Kill Bill is about nothing more (or less) than its director's passion for the mindless action pictures that got him through adolescence. It isn't sex without love: It's an orgy with just enough love.","60","266697"
"7544","What's on screen, though, is a cautious approach to cinema wizardry -- broad, colorful strokes and flash-bang effects that turn J.K. Rowling's words into a long, cheerful spectacle with a Muggle soul.","60","241527"
"7545","The script is compelling, the direction confident, the production values professional. But it does not, in the end, feel real.","60","824747"
"7546","There is much to admire in the fluidity of Girard’s storytelling, in the music (Ray Chen did the violin solos) and in the complicated questions raised about social obligations. Still, the movie never quite justifies the contrivance of its puzzle-box construction.","60","1657517"
"7547","Michôd creates a good deal of ambient menace in The Rover; Pearce has a simmering presence. But I felt there was a bit of muddle, and the clean lines of conflict and tension had been blurred: the dystopian future setting doesn't add much and hasn't been very rigorously imagined.","60","2345737"
"7548","This is highly competent catnip for the watercooler crowd.","60","1837703"
"7549","Safety Not Guaranteed doesn't quite know what kind of comedy it wants to be; the humor works best in its first hour, when the news-of-the-weird plot takes on a suggestive dimension of romantic desperation.","60","1862079"
"7550","The visual environment created by the filmmakers (Phil Lord and Christopher Miller of “21 Jump Street” wrote and directed; the animation is by Animal Logic) hums with wit and imagination... The story is a busy, slapdash contraption designed above all to satisfy the imperatives of big-budget family entertainment.","60","1490017"
"7551","Diverting, energetic, and even reasonably satisfying, so long as you aren't looking for a real musical to take its place.","60","203009"
"7552","The creepy set pieces are repetitive and the payoff is rather unsatisfying, even though the prophecies do eventually pan out.","60","265349"
"7553","The old master, now a slave to television, has turned out another Hitchcock-and-bull story in which the mystery is not so much who done it as who cares.","60","52357"
"7554","Ang Lee's adaptation of Yann Martel's mega-selling novel Life Of Pi is technically adept, mildly engaging and thematically pedantic.","60","454876"
"7555","If you hear the Rocky theme and think '118 118', you might wonder what all the fuss is about. For the rest of us, this is a reminder of why we fell in love with the character in the first place.","60","479143"
"7556","Heavy with pop allusions and references to other crime underworld movies, including The Godfather and Chinatown, Zootopia is impressive in its visual conception and scope: At once straightforward and densely layered with wit and incident, it manages a lively clip and the odd fresh joke.","60","2948356"
"7557","The film's elliptical character development sometimes renders the actors' work opaque; restraint is an underpracticed virtue, but even it can be taken to excess.","60","285742"
"7558","Director Neil Jordan includes some graphic and grisly maninto-wolf transformations (done better in An American Werewolf in London), but his ambitious fantasy never really works up a good fright. [06 May 1985, p.73]","60","87075"
"7559","It’s unfortunate that Light feels both too traditional and too concerned with showcasing life behind the music, instead of trying to explain why Williams was one of the greatest American musicians of the last century.","60","1490785"
"7560","It's a shame that Jeepers Creepers cops out -- as American genre movies have been doing for years -- and plays it safe with an F/X-heavy creature that no one would believe in a thousand years.","60","263488"
"7561","Formula is now the name of the game, although a steady diet of stunts and shootouts ensures that the audience is never bored.","60","257076"
"7562","It's easy enough to just soak up star Matthew McConaughey's good-ol'-boy appeal and overlook the film's stilted dialogue, bizarre directorial indulgences, excessive running time and boilerplate ""Law and Order""-style narrative.","60","1189340"
"7563","Not revolutionary or even evolutionary but enormously .... methodical. Working from an Elmore Leonard novel, Tarantino has created a gangster fiction that is never larger than life and sometimes smaller.","60","119396"
"7564","Gorgeous animation and inspired set design help patch over a lacklustre script. The horror hardcore will enjoy playing spot the homage.","60","1623288"
"7565","While it fascinates as much as it frustrates, the film’s saving grace is that it always feels honest and never cynical. It seems both relevant to us and personal to the filmmaker.","60","478304"
"7566","Mitchell's unwillingness to define the parameters of the specter haunting Jay leads to a finale that's muddled and confusing, and definitely not scary.","60","3235888"
"7567","Despite the intriguing set-up, there's something unambitious and scaled-back about Star Trek Nemesis, so that most of the time it feels like a slightly suped-up episode of the ""Next Generation"" TV series.","60","253754"
"7568","The outlandish premise and greasy title may be a little hard to swallow, but Danny Leiner's proudly moronic film embraces its boneheadedness so cheerfully that its lowbrow charms are nearly irresistible.","60","366551"
"7569","The film burdens itself with too many story lines and an overlong (though beautifully photographed) prologue, but things really get moving when Reeve takes the screen.","60","78346"
"7570","The jokes only make up for the pedestrian plot for so long. There was a time when animated fare with generic stories sufficed. But now we expect more from them, because they have, pardon the pun, evolved. The Croods, like its title family, hasn’t.","60","481499"
"7571","Freddy Krueger is the most talkative of slashers, and also the most creative. In A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors, he displays a great debt to Dali in concocting surreal visions for his prey. When Freddy enters the dreams of his teen-age victims, ordinary objects become armed and dangerous.","60","93629"
"7572","A gentle, enjoyable musical fable.","60","829193"
"7573","How can a movie so steeped in post-Katrina imagery eschew even the smallest comment about social responsibility? Maybe that was deemed too earnest, a decision that makes zero sense when a twinkling score is ladled on like instant pathos. Real people aren't beasts, nor do they require starry-eyed glorification. Bring your liberal pity.","60","2125435"
"7574","This is a wannabe shocker with a clever premise that doesn't really get down and dirty or betray the base instincts of a born horror filmmaker.","60","2737304"
"7575","Despite the heavy doses of gore in The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, Tobe Hooper's pic is well made for an exploiter of its type... Sharp sense of composition and careful accumulation of detail also help enliven the crude plot, and the acting is above par for this type of film.","60","72271"
"7576","The two leads are on fine form, but the surrounding structure is too familiar from a thousand other films. Still, tense and occasionally twisty stuff.","60","488120"
"7577","Like his makeshift societies, Garland's tantalizing set-ups tend to unravel in unsatisfying ways.","60","289043"
"7578","Expensive pop disaster epic, manufactured for the market that made Airport a hit. Ronald Neame directed, with dull efficiency.","60","69113"
"7579","This vision of Gotham is as fastidious as the cockpit of a BMW. But rather than sell luxury sedans, Deception offers a fantasy even big money can't buy -- Wall Street as a cross between a James Bond adventure and a Victoria’s Secret spread.","60","800240"
"7580","Eastwood directs a sensible-looking genre film with smooth expertise, but its plot is quietly berserk.","60","118548"
"7581","Once you start reckoning with Anomalisa’s obsession with self-absorption, the novelty of this one-man pity party begins to wear off. A little puppet pain goes a long way.","60","2401878"
"7582","An amusing scenario gets a big boost from winning performances all round -- which lift it well above other bride vs. buddy 'triangle' japes like, say, ""You, Me And Dupree.""","60","1155056"
"7583","It's the most exaggerated example yet of the abiding imbalance in modernist filmmaking, where an abundance of texture fails to conceal a minimum of substance, although it frequently makes the act of concealment pictorially exciting. [27 Mar 1981, p.C1]","60","83190"
"7584","McKay’s attempt to cover so much ground is admirable; and the outrage that courses throughout is deeply felt. But his busy execution...feels labored.","60","1596363"
"7585","The movie, which is simultaneously arrogant and timorous, has been unable to separate the important material from the merely colorful.","60","102138"
"7586","The film works, cleanly, without any tiresome reliance on computer graphics.","60","245120"
"7587","The payoff doesn't quite equal the intensity of the spectacularly squirm-inducing premise, but Farrell takes his showboating star turn and runs with it.","60","183649"
"7588","The more things drag on, the more monotonous they become and, by the end, Hard Candy has devolved into a rather transparent game of one-upmanship in which Hayley and Jeff come across in almost equally repellent measure, their behaviors driven less by organic impulses than by their need to satisfy the script's elaborate series of reversals and counter-reversals.","60","424136"
"7589","Children, innocent as they are, may not yet have grown to loathe the actor's (Robin Williams) shtick, but you might like to know that he has two--yes, two--roles in this film.","60","366548"
"7590","This is extremely silly, good natured, superficial stuff; a lot depends on whether you take to Bill and Ted's unique lingo (which contorts surfers' expressions) and their gormless behaviour.","60","96928"
"7591","It's a bureaucratic noir nightmare that may put you more readily in mind of Kafka, albeit with a tone of tongue-in-cheek bleakness that's bracing and funny – at least at first.","60","1825157"
"7592","A largely sexless sex romp, has such a winning sense of middle-aged exhaustion to it that you might want to add a star or two, especially if you're familiar with the banalities of matrimonial bliss.","60","480687"
"7593","The hard-focus, realistic quality of the picture's photography and style completes its characterization as a calculated social document.","60","47443"
"7594","Surprisingly watchable for the third sequel and despite its general predictability it's entertainingly inventive.","60","95742"
"7595","The movie's most glaring flaw is that the brothers and their screenwriters, Terry Hayes and Rafael Yglesias, don't manage to preserve the secret of the Ripper's identity for nearly as long as they intend to.","60","120681"
"7596","Often feels like a mediocre time-waster, and yet it sticks in the mind.","60","307901"
"7597","Crowe's undeniable gifts -- his well-crafted individual scenes and his love for his characters -- are more evident here than his flaws.","60","368709"
"7598","The direction is often questionable, but the screenplay (by James Agee, John Collier, Huston, and Peter Viertel from C.S. Forester's novel) is a model of tight construction.","60","43265"
"7599","Director David Yates, who is new to the Potter franchise, moves the story along briskly, at the expense of texture and nuance.","60","373889"
"7600","There's barely a frame that doesn't look stretched, smashed or otherwise harassed. Imagine ""The Matrix"" on speed, and you're halfway there.","60","493464"
"7601","That there's moral ambiguity to his actions represents some sort of step up from the cinematic norm. Alas, Christopher Walken has very little to do as Creasy's best buddy.","60","328107"
"7602","Starts out, and ends up, as a thriller trying valiantly to show us layers of moral depth. But in between that beginning and ending, Paxton's vision (as well as that of Brent Hanley, who wrote the script) becomes wavy and indistinct, a blurry muddle of sensationalistic, prurient grisliness masquerading as a meditation on the nature of evil.","60","264616"
"7603","Though the movie is clearly meant to work on its own, the relationship between Starling and Lecter plays best if you're familiar with ""Lambs.""","60","212985"
"7604","Neeson's performance is so eerie, in a buttoned-down sort of way.","60","838247"
"7605","Much is left undeveloped, from Jane's ghostly anxieties to Rochester's evolving complexity. Wasikowska and Fassbender lack chemistry, and the latter never finds his character's depth.","60","1229822"
"7606","As with 1999’s deceptively deep South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut and, more recently, The Lego Movie, the script works hard to invest its scenario with an existential and political dimension, crudely but effectively expressed.","60","1700841"
"7607","Theme of the pic, based on Sol Yurick’s 1965 novel, is a variation on countless westerns and war films. Update the setting to modern-day New York, and the avenues of escape to graffiti-emblazoned subway cars, and that’s The Warriors.","60","80120"
"7608","Though it feels at first like a musty edition of ""Masterpiece Theatre,"" Michael Hoffman's adaptation of a novel by Jay Parini holds enough surprises to make a memorable impact.","60","824758"
"7609","Though not much about the film sticks with you, it's a reliable piece of fluff that delivers the goods.","60","122933"
"7610","It's hardly a perfect film, not even close, but it is the most entertaining made-for-adults studio movie of the summer, and one of the reasons it works at all is the great skill and commitment Cruise brings to the starring role.","60","1013743"
"7611","Walter Hill has a dazzling competence as an action director; he uses the locale for its paranoia-inducing strangeness (it suggests Vietnam), and he uses the men to demonstrate what he thinks it takes to survive. Its limitation is that there's nothing underneath the characters' macho masks.","60","83111"
"7612","Poky but often charming.","60","163187"
"7613","Shot in grainy, high contrast black-and-white with a lot of simple but effective optical and aural tricks to suggest the workings of his unusual mind, this is one of the most intimate movies in recent memory.","60","138704"
"7614","THE Kingdom has some power but not enough sense. A ripped-from-today's-headlines thriller, it wants us to feel as if we're watching something relevant when what's really going on is a slick excuse for efficient mayhem that's not half as smart as it would like to be.","60","431197"
"7615","The acting is all first base, the script a laughable stream of gung ho-isms, the action merely solid and the effects indifferent. Yet, you still stroll out with a grin a mile wide.","60","116253"
"7616","When it's all over, you can't remember if you've been watching a movie or just a jumbo-sized coming attraction.","60","120591"
"7617","The film's secret weapon proves to be Freddy Krueger–fingernailed witch Marique, whom Rose McGowan plays with the kind of fuck-it-all brio - imagine a cross between Madeline Kahn in ""History of the World: Part I"" and Lady Gaga - that should garner her a Razzie and an Oscar.","60","816462"
"7618","They have also stripped out almost all complexity, reducing the drama to a familiar match between good and evil. You've heard all the speeches before; only the nouns have been changed. [23 Dec 1993, p.A9]","60","107818"
"7619","This will not appeal to everyone, whether it will appeal to anyone is another question. With dark humour from time to time, underneath an extremely repulsive concept, this is a relatively conventional horror movie.","60","1467304"
"7620","[The] conversation peters out as the film grinds on, the men getting competitive and the camera nosing into their faces. Everyone involved sifts the material a little too hard for clues to Wallace's eventual suicide.","60","3416744"
"7621","There's something decidedly mechanical about this intermittently gripping movie's bleak view of human nature.","60","120324"
"7622","The direction, by a former stuntman, concentrates on the action and happily leaves everyone to their own devices, with almost nothing to do. Field shows what natural acting is all about, and Reynolds' send-ups of himself are, despite repetition, becoming more likeable. Here his kidding around is exactly in tune with this fast-moving but essentially lazy vehicle.","60","76729"
"7623","A Serious Man, like “Burn After Reading,” is in their bleak, black, belittling mode, and it’s hell to sit through.","60","1019452"
"7624","The movie gets funnier and less obvious as it goes along, and Zooey Deschanel is a hoot as a disdainfully bored co-worker who ritually insults the zombie chain-store shoppers -- but what is The Good Girl saying, exactly?","60","279113"
"7625","Your mileage may vary — along with patience. Despite all the talk of the Shimmer, Annihilation sputters.","60","2798920"
"7626","While the scenario has all the smirking charm of Stillman's earlier movies, the sobering realities of off-campus life are never even alluded to, and the humor of insularity eventually becomes stifling.","60","1667307"
"7627","The actors in Notes on a Scandal are equally distinguished: Ms. Dench and Ms. Blanchett are among the finest on the market today, and each can deliver expert performances, even when, as is the case here, their roles are false and hollow. The performers sell the goods, but the goods are cheap.","60","465551"
"7628","Can't match the original's shock factor --abortion isn't the taboo subject it once was and the women of Sex and the City have helped make playing the field good, dirty fun.","60","375173"
"7629","Fortunately the story of an alternative future is realised with such visual imagination and sparky humour that it's only half way through that the plot's weaknesses become apparent","60","88846"
"7630","Vikander packs a punch but this Tomb Raider is a long way off the Holy Grail of the first three Indy movies.","60","1365519"
"7631","A quintet of actors carve out a beautiful, ill-fated geometry in John Wells's layoff drama, which might play like a retort to ""Up in the Air"" if it didn't have shortcomings of its own.","60","1172991"
"7632","It remains a puzzling dream, vivid in detail and overly obvious in symbolism, fueled by half-digested lumps of malice and wonder.","60","169547"
"7633","A courageous film, especially from a first-time director, and deserves all the audience support it can attract. It’s a People Story, and it’s About Something. However, it’s also something of a heavy sit.","60","247425"
"7634","Unlike Walter Salles’s recent adaptation of On The Road, which embraced the Beat philosophy with a wide and credulous grin, Kill Your Darlings is inquisitive about the movement’s worth, and the genius of its characters is never assumed.","60","1311071"
"7635","A tour de force of technical brilliance, with flashes of humor and a wild spirit of adventure signifying that you're not supposed to take it too seriously, but the cumulative impact of its avalanche of mayhem is so numbing that it's enough to shrivel your soul.","60","116908"
"7636","Director Martin Campbell's lumpy direction doesn't coalesce into anything much beyond a pleasant assembly of set pieces.","60","120746"
"7637","The fact that the films that serve as her models often sported the same flaws doesn’t excuse this fairly poker-faced spoof’s sometimes borderline-torpid pace and disappointing fade-out.","60","3908142"
"7638","The world's worst film gets an affectionate making-of dramatization that's half as weird as the real thing.","60","3521126"
"7639","The director’s game is level, and typically mischievous, but lacks something - and it’s not just the vicious sting at the end of, say, Hidden.","60","5304464"
"7640","The flaw that separates Scorsese's film into its components is its lack of a crystallized theme.","60","217505"
"7641","There's something almost maniacally heroic about packaging the fourth sequel of a superhero action series without resorting to the old standbys of good writing, capable acting or inspired directing.","60","118688"
"7642","Came alive only in the presence of a supposed dead man -- specifically, the nefarious Lord Voldemort.","60","330373"
"7643","Many of the chaotic set pieces cataloging Annie's self-destruction have a kind of dumb crassness that works against Bridesmaids' often smart, highly class-conscious deconstruction of female friendship and competition.","60","1478338"
"7644","The film has some of Disney's most spectacular animation yet -- particularly in the wildebeest stampede -- and strong vocal performances, especially by skilled Broadway comedian Nathan Lane. However, it suffers from a curiously undeveloped story line.","60","110357"
"7645","Mr. De Niro and Mr. Grodin are lunatic delights, which is somewhat more than can be said for the movie, whose mechanics keep getting in the way of the performances. [20 July 1988, p.C15]","60","95631"
"7646","While not quite the war movie that many of us were hoping to see right now, Mendes’ dispassionate take on the first Gulf War has many merits, and it does bring vividly to life the peculiar dilemma of the modern soldier.","60","418763"
"7647","Grainy as it looks in its massive Imax blowup, Mickey's misadventures with water and a broom still have the kind of magic even modern technology can't always manage.","60","120910"
"7648","What's surprising about this traditional thriller, moderately successful but not completely satisfying, is exactly how genteel and unsurprising the execution turns out to be.","60","258000"
"7649","For its delicate tone, provocative themes, impeccable craftsmanship and superb performances-by Carey Mulligan, Andrew Garfield and Keira Knightley-Never Let Me Go earned my great admiration. I wish I'd been affected in equal measure, but I wasn't, and it's not the sort of film you can will yourself to enjoy.","60","1334260"
"7650","While those flaws might conspire to keep A Fantastic Woman from being unassailably fantastic as a whole, there's no denying that it is fantastically timely, and touching to boot.","60","5639354"
"7651","Dolph Lundgren looks just as if he’s stepped out of a comic book. Thankfully, he breezes through the B-grade plot with tongue firmly placed in cheek.","60","98141"
"7652","The distressing Ford penchant for symbols of religiosity which had marred The Fugitive does the same disservice here.","60","40064"
"7653","Some okay thrills with good performances and some smarts. But the last reel plunge spoils things. Myth for the new millennium: any average, out-of-shape middle-aged Yank, including the President, can get in a punch-up with a few well-armed, super-trained terrorists, and win.","60","443274"
"7654","Rather than confront the guilt related to the sins of the past it paints over them in vivid colours, hoping the viewer will collude in its melodramatic muddying of the water.","60","31381"
"7655","It's all overblown: too much music, too much cutting, too much zooming, too much computerized special effects, too much clanky symbolism that never works.","60","151137"
"7656","The Place Beyond the Pines is ambitious and epic, perhaps to a fault.","60","1817273"
"7657","Jensen Daggett is a standout as the troubled young girl on whom Jason is fixated. V.C. Dupree has vibrant energy in his boxing scenes, Sharlene Martin has a fine time with the bitch role, and Martin Cummins is funny as a video freak who compulsively films the proceedings.","60","97388"
"7658","The large cast, costumed and made up as filthy scalawags and sinister buccaneers, gives tremendous energy to every scene.","60","325980"
"7659","The real point of This is The End, however, is to make people laugh -- and it accomplishes that. Often, in fact -- and satisfyingly.","60","1245492"
"7660","Scott’s latest is a thrill-ride that blasts through celestial carnage, while building a bigger Alien world that might not be 100% necessary. Out of all the films in the franchise, Alien: Covenant has the least stand-alone potential – but dammit if it’s not a wild, warp-speed-killing-machine adventure.","60","2316204"
"7661","A sweet but slight love story about world-weary hipster bloodsuckers.","60","1714915"
"7662","Though it tries to be different, with hair's-breadth escapes that don't depend on implausible stunts or Bondian-scale explosions, Conspiracy Theory is an uneasy mix of laughs and thrills; suspense and soap.","60","118883"
"7663","Cleverly conceived, skillfully made and performed with unflagging verve, it's a change of pace (slower) and scale (smaller) for Mr. Scott, the director of such pounding epics as ""Gladiator"" and ""Black Hawk Down."" Yet this intimate, intricate con about a couple of petty con men selling water filtration systems is also remote and forgettable in the end, a lapidary icicle.","60","325805"
"7664","It’s always rewarding to see her (Bening) in action, even though her latest movie, Film Stars Don’t Die In Liverpool, doesn’t measure up to her performance.","60","5711148"
"7665","Jackson and his team seem compelled to flesh out the world of their earlier trilogy in scenes that would be better left to extended-edition DVDs (or omitted entirely), all but failing to set up a compelling reason for fans to return for the second installment.","60","903624"
"7666","Audiard’s expressionistic flourishes are in shorter supply here than usual, although the shootouts have a dreamlike quality, with pistols blasting showers of sparks like miniature steam train funnels.","60","4971344"
"7667","Tower Heist is funny in the way of so many Hollywood comedies, meaning that individual scenes are often crisply written and played, but the whole doesn't add up to anything.","60","471042"
"7668","The movie version has the exciting and challenging parts down but the moral awakening it so strenuously wants us to experience remains beyond its reach.","60","1371111"
"7669","Sheridan gives this a pacing and depth one doesn't often find in ""urban"" product, though Jackson, reliving his own life traumas, is handily upstaged at every turn by Terrence Howard (Crash) as his oddball manager.","60","430308"
"7670","Rare to the memory is a film like Frances which runs 140 minutes and its star is on the screen 85% of the time in one intense scene after another. It’s quite an accomplishment for Jessica Lange and it’s too bad a better film didn’t come of it.","60","83967"
"7671","Ask yourself: Just how curious are you to understand the source of Shia LaBeouf’s insecurities and rage? If this is a subject of high importance to you, then you’re in luck, because Honey Boy offers a sincere window into the actor’s soul: a vulnerable, honest (or at least honest-seeming) act of therapy through screenwriting","60","8151874"
"7672","Three losers of late, the actors succeed quite nicely in unifying the movie's multiple personalities, its ricocheting screenplay.","60","99653"
"7673","If 1492 is dramatically inert, it is just the opposite visually. Its director is Ridley Scott, a wizard at re-creating the look of other realities, and he's done a remarkable job here, filling the screen with ravishing sequences from both the Old World and the New that are dazzling and intoxicating.","60","103594"
"7674","[A] mostly engaging but only fitfully inspired serio-comedy.","60","1791682"
"7675","It's no worse than any number of other cookie-cutter slasher flicks geared for the slightly post-pubescent market.","60","146336"
"7676","While the film doesn’t achieve the same thrills of the final 45 minutes of Predator in terms of overall excitement, it outdoes its first safari in start-to-finish hysteria. The real star is the pic’s design. Writers don’t waste much time on character development.","60","100403"
"7677","A safe, effectively jumpy transfer of Alien to the depths that restores the fear of Jaws into an environment momentarily softened by The Abyss.","60","97737"
"7678","Rendition offers few surprises, and it tips its hand too soon and too predictably to do much more than goose your weary outrage.","60","804522"
"7679","The only grace note in the generally clunky Wonder Woman is its star, the five-foot-ten-inch Israeli actress and model Gal Gadot, who is somehow the perfect blend of superbabe-in-the-woods innocence and mouthiness.","60","451279"
"7680","Gilliam has a cacophonous imagination; even the magical incongruities are often cancelled out by the incessant buzz of cleverness. It's far from a bad movie, but it doesn't quite click together, either. The director doesn't shape the material satisfyingly; this may be one of those rare pictures that suffers from a surfeit of good ideas.","60","81633"
"7681","Whenever writer-director Oren Moverman moves past these scattered and admittedly voyeuristic moments into the lives of the two soldiers, the movie drifts into received wisdom and unconvincing romance.","60","790712"
"7682","The Witches of Eastwick is a theme park without a theme. Like Nicholson and his co-stars, Miller doesn't have a lot on his mind. He just wants to have fun. His movie is organized mayhem, a strange and funny tour de force. [15 June 1987, p.1D]","60","94332"
"7683","You don't even have to be familiar with the first book in Rick Riordan's popular fantasy series to enjoy Chris Columbus' energetic adaptation.","60","814255"
"7684","Maybe I’m repeating myself: The Hateful Eight is a Quentin Tarantino movie. But Mr. Tarantino is also repeating himself, spinning his wheels here in a way he has rarely done before. None of his other films venture so far into tedium or manage to get in their own way so frequently.","60","3460252"
"7685","Victoria & Abdul is a pleasant enough entertainment, and it will bring the inevitable awards chatter Dench’s way (is her acting ever less than pinpoint? Never). But as prestige period pieces go, it’s far from top-drawer (more like second drawer, or even third), because its cozy lack of enlightenment is echoed in the standard but far from scintillating play of its drama.","60","5816682"
"7686","Wavers between being condescending and downright preposterous, but there are redeeming moments.","60","115639"
"7687","Nora Ephron, who wrote and directed this, repeatedly alludes to the 1957 ""An Affair to Remember"" as her principal point of reference, yet at no point does she indicate any awareness of what makes that tragicomic love story sublime and this one merely cutesy.","60","108160"
"7688","You may feel safe in your bed, but be warned: even as you sleep, Earth is under threat from a vast, overheated surplus of character actors.","60","120647"
"7689","Fox is fun as a demonic harpy, but sadly the meeting of Hollywood’s two rock’n’roll queens is closer to safe studio product than slash-and-burn envelope-pusher.","60","1131734"
"7690","A tormented movie about torment; loopy, over-reaching and occasionally suspicious. Simultaneously, it is a daring artistic endeavour.","60","335345"
"7691","An entertaining romp through familiar cop-and-crim cat-and-mousery, bolstered by strong star turns from Washington and Crowe. Still, it has neither the intelligence nor the grip to jump from the merely good to the truly great.","60","765429"
"7692","A silly but moderately effective chiller about creeping parasites that systematically (and comically) 'infect' an entire highrise population with nothing less than sexual hysteria.","60","73705"
"7693","This movie should have blown us out of the water. Instead we catch ourselves occasionally thinking the unpardonable thought: ""OK, sink already.""","60","120338"
"7694","Sure, Sagan’s scientific method dominates the universe. But here on earth, this crowd-pleaser convinces us to spend one day savoring an American Dream.","60","6423362"
"7695","So visually striking, so compulsively watchable as storytelling, and so personal even in its enigmas that I found it much more pleasurable than any of the Hollywood genre films I've seen lately.","60","142688"
"7696","The verbal and conceptual gags, however, belong wholly to Martin's own brand of goofiness, and some of them are pretty funny.","60","79367"
"7697","Since the codes of science fiction are different from horror's cant, the patented Williamson method doesn't make a perfect fit with the material; Faculty's fun, but less fun than it could be.","60","133751"
"7698","Not one of Hitchcock's best, but with a few creative sequences and some sharp writing from Dorothy Parker.","60","35279"
"7699","Okay, it may not be Shakespeare, but it's a welcome bonus, for neither Chow or Wahlberg looks out of place in crossfire that would likely leave trained military personnel shell-shocked.","60","142192"
"7700","The overall effect of Demme's film is a little like experiencing Nazi prison camps through reruns of Hogan's Heroes, right down to the few bona fide laughs.","60","123964"
"7701","Evincing more visible intelligence than any of his human co-stars aside from Lithgow, Caesar is disquietingly lifelike.","60","1318514"
"7702","The movie doesn't for a moment pretend to be subtle, and it has a sprawling, unfocused quality. But it's got some juice, and it's even faithful, in some surprising ways, to the essence of the original.","60","770772"
"7703","Overlord injects a healthy dose of schlock into familiar war-movie tropes to create an entertainingly grungy hybrid, but it never quite kicks into overdrive.","60","4530422"
"7704","The movie is fun to look at without quite being exciting to watch. This is mostly because the story never fully lives up to the ideas, and the ideas themselves are fuzzy and scattered.","60","6241872"
"7705","A candy-colored, superficially fizzy revenge fantasy with a startlingly corrosive undercurrent of bitterness and frustration.","60","120032"
"7706","It doesn’t entirely work, but there’s something about its full-throttle nastiness that lingers, and it’s refreshing to see something that exists in the studio system that possesses so many queasily perverse elements. It’s just not quite as seductive as it thinks it is.","60","2873282"
"7707","The plot, of course, is merely an excuse for an endless series of gags, and the percentage of them that score is fairly high. But since the jokes are based over and over on the fact that Lloyd and Harry are really, really dumb, a certain repetitive factor sets in.","60","109686"
"7708","Portraying the same 1945 confrontation from the vantage point of the Japanese was an inspired idea. Unfortunately, the movie it inspired is something of a letdown.","60","498380"
"7709","Shadow isn’t a bad epic so much as a banal one.","60","6864046"
"7710","With its clever premise and quartet of appealing comedic star turns, Wild Hogs is a step above the typical comedies rolling off the assembly lines of the major studios.","60","486946"
"7711","Be forewarned: this comedy bears only the faintest resemblance to the classic book and film of the same name.","60","349205"
"7712","Hughes may deserve more plaudits as a social worker than a filmmaker, but you have to admit his hokey situation plays. The reason is the five terrific young actors, who bring more conviction to these parts than they perhaps deserve.","60","88847"
"7713","Though it's as foolish as the first film, is rather more fun to watch and sometimes very stylish-looking.","60","77394"
"7714","Sorkin’s heavily heightened sense of drama works best when the stakes are equally aligned but, despite the film constantly informing you of just how incredibly important everything all is, it’s disappointingly difficult to truly care about what’s taking place.","60","2080374"
"7715","It's frenetic to the point of crazy while achieving a mark that barely exceeds mediocre.","60","440963"
"7716","There’s a dark streak of comic absurdity running throughout Harold and Maude that serves a dual purpose; it gives the film its unique, heightened tone, but it also conversely grounds the more whimsical element by hinting at a greater darkness beyond the events portrayed within.","60","67185"
"7717","The plot doesn't always make sense, despite a thunderous explicatory montage halfway through, but as a fresh setting for terror shenanigans.","60","288477"
"7718","The writer in Soderbergh proves the ultimate weak link. In sex, lies' last third, he seems seized with a compulsion to make sense of it all, bring everything to bear, give everyone their moral comeuppance, their screenplay payoff.","60","98724"
"7719","There’s no doubt it makes for a jubilant ride, a galvanic first blast. But it remains a film which feels deeply thought rather than deeply felt; a brilliant technical exercise as opposed to a flesh-and-blood story.","60","2562232"
"7720","Driven equally by big questions and the abiding desire for small pleasures, like a decent cup of tea, it's an eccentric, mind-bending head trip that greets every catastrophe with an endearingly goofy smile that embodies Hitchhiker's Guide's Zen mantra: Don't Panic!","60","371724"
"7721","This new Star Trek is nonsense, no question (""Prepare the red matter!""), but at least it's not boggy nonsense, the way most of the other movies were, and it powers along, unheeding of its own absurdity, with a drive and a confidence that the producers of the original TV series might have smiled upon.","60","796366"
"7722","A film with a fistful of memorable moments—most of them involving Bridges hurling insults at people—but not a great deal new to say.","60","2582782"
"7723","Simple, it is as by-the-books formulaic as can be, and there's not a surprise around that the corner that isn't obvious immediately.","60","467197"
"7724","By now we’ve seen so many good, bad, and indifferent Sherlocks that it’s almost a relief to get something different, however wrongheaded. And there’s no such thing as too much Downey.","60","988045"
"7725","The minions give good mayhem and the twig-armed animation’s lovely. Despite the coolest submarine-car since Bond’s Lotus Esprit, though, Despicable Me 2 is light on gadgets – and surprises, too.","60","1690953"
"7726","Director Jon Favreau's experiment in genre crossbreeding - a Western-sci-fi mashup pumped full of inspirational all-in-this-together spirit - is a cute, crowd-pleasing idea, though more decadent than a revitalization of either genre.","60","409847"
"7727","It's so almost moving -- a meticulously crafted mechanical bird -- that it nearly feels like the real thing.","60","421715"
"7728","While Airplane II, proves to be a breezy and tolerably consistent follow-up to its successful prototype, a parodistic copy that relied less on jokes from the original might have seemed a shade fresher. [11 Dec 1982, p.C1]","60","83530"
"7729","Hellraiser is certainly a cut or two above the slasher films that seem to proliferate on Friday the 13ths and Halloweens. It's a decidedly adult picture, with some disquieting sexual tensions that simply wouldn't work with the usual teen crew. It's also a treatise on the thin line between pleasure and pain and how easily crossed it can be.","60","93177"
"7730","It’s a glorious spectacle, but a slight drama, with few characters and too-rare flashes of humour. It wants to awe us into submission, to concede our insignificance in the face of such grand-scale art. It achieves that with ease. Yet on his way to making an epic, Nolan forgot to let us have fun.","60","816692"
"7731","It doesn't matter if the movie around Firth is a good one or a lousy one: Either way, I wouldn't be able to explain how an actor could come up with a performance as subtle, in both its heartbreak and its magnificence, as this one is.","60","1315981"
"7732","For all its relatability, the movie is safe and sitcomishly amusing rather than sharply funny, hitting the same genial notes over and over instead of building real comic momentum.","60","4501454"
"7733","Never less than slick, precision-tooled multiplex entertainment, Kingsman hews close to the formula Vaughn and his co-writer Jane Goldman established in their superficially similar ""Kick-Ass"": hyperspeed action, pithy one-liners and grotesque ultraviolence.","60","2802144"
"7734","Then Plame's cover gets blown, and so does the film's; suddenly, the clunky melodrama that had been lurking in the shadows starts hogging the spotlight.","60","977855"
"7735","The fourth-wall-smashing is fun in a Ferris Bueller kind of way, but it’s never pulled off with the devious panache of Blazing Saddles, let alone Funny Games or Hellzapoppin’. Since it's this stuff, rather than the ongoing thud-thud-thud of bad language and gore, that feels mould-breaking, it’s a pity Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick’s screenplay doesn’t have the courage to experiment a little more.","60","1431045"
"7736","The cynics will scoff and dismiss it all as manipulative, the heartstring-tugging machine on hyperdrive. But this movie isn't for them; did you not see the PG? It's a sweet, sincere, utterly affable kids' movie about how parents are all kinds of screwed up and unable to tell their kids what they want or show them how they feel.","60","1389137"
"7737","If you're able to think of characters as just air bubbles to get past, then dive in, the excitement's fine.","60","881320"
"7738","Though the dialogue rings too chirpy (""Gee whiz!"") and faintly anachronistic (""Get over it, man!""), the acting is wonderfully subtle, especially John Mahoney's turn as Bryce's grimly clear-eyed grandfather.","60","817177"
"7739","There are echoes of Stephen Spielberg's ""Duel,"" as well as ""Roadgames,"" ""The Hitcher"" and ""The Hills Have Eyes,"" but director/cowriter Mostow isn't interested in hommages: He's just looking to crank up the suspense (not the in your face action, thank heavens), bit by miserable bit, and does a very nice job of it.","60","118771"
"7740","As far as producer, director, femme lead and screenwriter are concerned, this attempt to visually analyze the bits and pieces that go into making a marriage, and then making it work, is successful. If it drags a bit here and there, blame it on the stodgy performance of actor Albert Finney who is unable to convey the lightness, gaiety and romanticism needed.","60","62407"
"7741","Three elements rescue Three Men and a Baby from its inherent shallowness: its casting, pacing and its infant. Nimoy capitalizes on parental instincts without being cloying or cute, so after viewing Three Men and a Baby's tender moments, it's practically impossible to dismiss the movie as mere fluff. [27 Nov 1987, p.7]","60","94137"
"7742","Mr. Brooks capitalizes on antiseptic, fluorescent interiors, while the score, by David Buckley, nicely accents stress points.","60","1603257"
"7743","Rodriguez's film is a high-octane fun-house ride with only one speed: sick-making.","60","116367"
"7744","Tim Burton remains the Wizard of Odd with this eye-filling if problematic confection.","60","99487"
"7745","A fitfully witty and reliably spine-tingling horror melodrama...While it works you over effectively, Poltergeist betrays a good deal of rather dubious, uncoordinated manipulation. [4 June 1982, p.D1]","60","84516"
"7746","It's a fairly effective melodrama with an inventive visual design, swift pacing and convincing performances by Liam Neeson (as Westlake/Darkman), Frances McDormand (as Westlake's girlfriend) and Larry Drake (as the heavy). [24 Aug. 1990, p.4]","60","99365"
"7747","The effects never really get ahead of the characters or the script's layered personality.","60","185371"
"7748","Like the ""girls,"" the movie is flamboyant in almost every respect - the costumes, the humor and the sentimentality. [1 Sep 1994]","60","109045"
"7749","The plotline has more holes than a tea bag, and is essentially no more than an excuse for a series of well executed special effects. Nevertheless, the film hangs reasonably well together, not least because of good performances from all concerned.","60","89686"
"7750","A film more concerned with 'how' than 'why' or 'who', Valkyrie would have benefited from more scrutiny and complexity. Still, once the bomb goes off, the thrills come in spades.","60","985699"
"7751","This is not as richly compelling as other Almodóvar films, but it’s a fluent and engaging work.","60","4326444"
"7752","Nobody does vapid bollocks as enjoyably as Tony Scott, and while this isn't as inventive as ""Man On Fire"" or as compelling as ""Crimson Tide,"" it's still the right side of dumb.","60","453467"
"7753","Fences has passages of fierce and moving power, but on screen the play comes off as episodic and more than a bit unwieldy.","60","2671706"
"7754","Ambassador Gregory Peck finds that he's adopted the Antichrist (and he's a cute little feller too), in the slickest of the many demonic thrillers that followed in the wake of The Exorcist. Richard Donner directs more for speed than mood, but there are a few good shocks.","60","75005"
"7755","Isn't as funny as it should be. Cedric's speech impediment only goes so far -- he's actually funnier in Serving Sara, without having to rely on a big wig to do his acting for him.","60","303714"
"7756","Trachtenberg is patient building this world, and the actors do a good job inhabiting it. Winstead is a terrific actress, and she makes Michelle's desperation and inventiveness believable. Goodman is never better than when playing a nut, and while we aren't sure if that's what he's doing here, the possibility makes for an intriguing portrayal.","60","1179933"
"7757","The gifted fantasy/sci-fi/horror specialist has made a film that's very bloody, and bloody stylish at that, one that's certainly unequaled in its field for the beauty of its camerawork, sets, costumes and effects. But it's also conventionally plotted and not surprising or scary at all, as it resurrects hoary horror tropes from decades ago to utilize them in conventional, rather than fresh or subversive ways","60","2554274"
"7758","Too long, too sexist, and too--shall we say--flaccid. But it has its moments.","60","405422"
"7759","Murder, skulduggery and an avalanche of plotting makes Rian Johnson's latest a retro pleasure for those who enjoy being dizzied.","60","8946378"
"7760","Plucks at the heart-strings in a far too push-button way.","60","99077"
"7761","It has managed, admirably, to strike a balance between the wholesome 'school nerd blossoms' fairy tale and the gross-out comedy that is now a teen movie standard.","60","265208"
"7762","The track record of SNL-drawn movies is dire (""It's Pat,"" ""Stuart Saves His Family,"" ""Blues Brothers 2000""), and this one stands just a peg higher, as an amiable, if flyweight, di-version.","60","120770"
"7763","For those seeking even a little adventurousness in their filmgoing experiences, the movie will wear thin very quickly.","60","185014"
"7764","Undeniably, The Post feels timely, but there’s a counter-argument to be made that, in our current era of “fake news” and easily swayed public opinion, it’s actually a dinosaur of a film—and not Jurassic Park. Thank God for the owners, it ultimately says, who sometimes do the right thing. That’s a perfectly fine idea, but our times could use something sharper.","60","6294822"
"7765","This thriller is a lot better than you might expect--especially for a Kevin Costner vehicle.","60","146309"
"7766","That rare comic book movie that actually feels like a comic book. Which turns out to be mostly, but not entirely, a good thing.","60","330793"
"7767","You can only cram so much of this stuff into a movie without putting your audience to sleep -- The movie sags badly in the middle, swirling around itself without making headway.","60","274558"
"7768","Despite the overlong running time, the action moves smoothly and swiftly.","60","808151"
"7769","Gets an ambitious, sometimes inspired but ultimately less than satisfying screen treatment from Roger Avary.","60","292644"
"7770","Possibly because Stone empathizes so enormously with co-writer Kovic, who came back from Vietnam at the age of 21 paralyzed from the chest down, the director has lost the specificity that made ""Platoon"" so electrifying. In its place he uses bombast, overkill, bullying. His scenes, and their ironic juxtapositioning, explode like land mines. [20 Dec 1989, p.1]","60","96969"
"7771","It’s like a Wes Anderson movie set during the Third Reich. ... And yet it’s not as if it’s a terrible movie; it’s actually a studiously conventional movie dressed up in the self-congratulatory “daring” of its look!-let’s-prank-the-Nazis cachet.","60","2584384"
"7772","Dunye's salvation is her sense of humor. She's good at creating light, bantering dialogue, and there are a couple of sharp, satirical scenes.","60","118125"
"7773","But for the most part, what you have here is a topnotch filmmaker getting back to basics and really delivering the goods.","60","120399"
"7774","Despite its hopeless predictability, this is one of those preposterous and sweet-natured family frolics that you find yourself enjoying in spite of yourself. Check your critical faculties in at the door and get stuck in.","60","105417"
"7775","Its fun first hour soon gives way to a leaden, expository approach that unwisely favors emotional stakes over speculative-fiction smarts.","60","1385826"
"7776","To give the movie its due, it's been directed, at least on the visual level, with unusual elegance: filled with graceful, gliding tracking shots, and icily precise Hitchcockian setups of the bleak decor and scary effects.","60","93777"
"7777","A clever, entertaining stunt, no more, no less.","60","185937"
"7778","As a grand flourish of cinematic technique, it is awesome; as a human drama, it is disgusting and silly, a mindless depiction of carnage on an epic scale. [15 July 1988, Calendar, p.6-1]","60","95016"
"7779","It isn't terrible, just disappointing.","60","60397"
"7780","Atkinson, who is in almost every scene, boasts a full-on comic personality that on the cinema screen is a bit daunting at times, and it's an open question as to whether the Carrey crowd will go for this seriously eccentric Brit.","60","118689"
"7781","Chilling and technically proficient and, also, fairly hollow.","60","180093"
"7782","In the end, the film isn't a complete waste of your time, and it is a neat little walk down a Patriot Act assisted cyber-terrorist ""what if..."" scenario, but don't expect anything brilliant.","60","1059786"
"7783","Director Paul Lynch seems to capture the spirit of the genre here, but spends a little too much time setting up each murder, thus eliminating some suspense.","60","81383"
"7784","Frances Ha is an irritant when it lingers. When Baumbach’s touch is more glancing — when he cuts before the humiliation — it sings.","60","2347569"
"7785","Despite all the confusion, it's a simple case of the script being too ambitious. It may emulate a man experiencing flashbacks, but it doesn't help the audience.","60","99871"
"7786","Certainly Sandler's most ambitious work. It's not just a bid for respectability but a genuine allegory.","60","185431"
"7787","Pleasurable.","60","385267"
"7788","Saw is so full of twists it ends up getting snarled. For all of his flashy engineering and inventive torture scenarios, the Jigsaw Killer comes across as an amateur. Hannibal Lecter would have him for lunch.","60","387564"
"7789","However you judge the movie’s politics, and whatever its flaws, there is something inarguable, something irreducibly honest and right, about Mr. Jones’s performance.","60","478134"
"7790","At times fun but mostly maddeningly uneven, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back feels less like a full-fledged movie than a side project Smith took on to amuse himself and his buddies.","60","261392"
"7791","Grand scale or no, this feels like a blockbuster on autopilot more often than not, curiously detached and self-importantly somber even by the director's standards - and without the cerebral heft of his best work.","60","1345836"
"7792","It all comes down to the Big Birthday Party and a furious bike ride, which he's clearly done before, in ""The 40 Year Old Virgin.""","60","1758830"
"7793","A curiously compulsive drama that for all its inevitable Dead Sailors’ Society trappings is still highly entertaining.","60","118158"
"7794","The Fault in Our Stars doesn't quite capture the discreetly twisted humor, or the muted anger, of Green's book, and its problems can be attributed to a constellation of little annoyances rather than any one serious, North Star–size flaw.","60","2582846"
"7795","Rust and Bone is somber and gritty if nothing else, a movie that takes itself very, very seriously, even as it struggles at times to find its focus.","60","2053425"
"7796","At its strongest, Gone Girl plays like a queasily, at times gleefully, funny horror movie about a modern marriage, one that has disintegrated partly because of spiraling downward mobility and lost privilege. Yet, as sometimes happens in Mr. Fincher’s work, dread descends like winter shadows, darkening the movie’s tone and visuals until it’s snuffed out all the light, air and nuance.","60","2267998"
"7797","To be sure, the film as a whole feels like a creaky vehicle, belabored with plot strands and stereotypes that only serve to highlight Winstead's ragged commitment to something real.","60","2063781"
"7798","The digital animation is far more evident here than in ""The Phantom Menace.""","60","172495"
"7799","It’s impossible not to be moved by Lili’s self-recognition and by her demand to be recognized by those who care most about her. But it’s also hard not to wish that The Danish Girl were a better movie, a more daring and emotionally open exploration of Lili’s emergence.","60","810819"
"7800","The epitome of middle-brow 'quality' drama -- admirable within its limitations, but Bernard Schlink's Oprah Winfrey Book Club-approved book wasn't exactly literature, as this isn't exactly cinema.","60","976051"
"7801","The film never coheres. Trying to carve out a space between black comedy and straight evocation of a difficult but rewarding marriage, the movie never settles on a tone.","60","975645"
"7802","Despite an element of gross bodily fluid-laden gags, Blockers manages to be heartfelt and endearing – even if the film’s message is sometimes heavy handed.","60","2531344"
"7803","On a purely visual level, it's the most powerful and viscerally exciting movie to come out of Hollywood this year. Which doesn't mean that it's all good.","60","137523"
"7804","Even the most enthusiastic future Indy scholar would have to concede that the movie's habit of quoting from venerable Hollywood antiquities sometimes has the unfortunate effect of reminding the viewer that those movies were better.","60","367882"
"7805","The utterance of the three gentle chimpanzees in Escape from the Planet of the Apes tends to blow you out of the cinema seat, not so much because they can talk as because they all speak the same language.","60","67065"
"7806","Weirdly, the film’s problem is that it revs up the tension so much that, like one character’s submersible sinking into the high pressure of the titular Abyss, it finally bursts. The climax – as Bud descends to defuse the nuke and meet the aliens – just doesn’t work.","60","96754"
"7807","Although The Postman conveys a thoroughly imagined vision of a future society, its basic concerns are actually far from those of traditional sci-fi, as it quickly comes to feel more like a Western than anything else.","60","119925"
"7808","The story is simple enough for young children to follow, and the computer-animated images are both bright and surprisingly complex. Adults won't find the action heart-stopping.","60","120363"
"7809","Like its predecessors, A Dry White Season is too reserved to effectively depict the hell of South Africa. Its most powerful moments occur in the courtroom, in jail cells and morgues filled with dead black children when its starched white protagonist is safely off-screen. [06 Oct 1989, p.6]","60","97243"
"7810","But the film also has its turgid, dialogue-heavy stretches, and the leading performances, if acceptable, are not everything they needed to be to fully flesh out these elegant immortals.","60","110148"
"7811","Scorses's skill as a scene-maker are fully evident and Lewis' quietly rageful performance offers to out-do De Niro in intensity, but neither funny enough to be an effective black comedy nor scary enough to capitalise on its thriller/horror elements, The King Of Comedy sits awkwardly between the two.","60","85794"
"7812","A decent film, but not a great romantic comedy.","60","372532"
"7813","Eye in the Sky is a tick-tock suspense exercise as well as a neat little ethical echo chamber, a plea for reason in a world exploding too vigorously to give it the time of day.","60","2057392"
"7814","It's hardly original nor necessary, but it's a fun and absorbing escapade on the Seven Seas.","60","1790809"
"7815","Better than ""The Transporter"" but not as much fun as ""Crank"".","60","472399"
"7816","What lifts this at key moments is the outstanding Phoenix's simpatico performance and we can add to the credit side happy casting that for once has assembled actresses and actors who really do resemble each other and present plausible siblings.","60","119381"
"7817","You see the spark of 'this is cool!,' but you don't sense a purpose. The underconceived Public Enemies suffers from that lack of drive, though Johnny Depp is so urgent and charismatic as John Dillinger, he provides enough firepower to make the film legit.","60","1152836"
"7818","Forman's decision to stick to the surface is probably, in the end, a wise one. Kaufman always wanted to keep us guessing, and this movie respects his wishes.","60","125664"
"7819","Though it easily surpasses most American action flicks, it suffers from the old commercial imperative of making the protagonist a nice guy, something Refn has seldom bothered with in Europe.","60","780504"
"7820","Joy has been replaced by a sense of laboriousness, even though the action sequences move along energetically enough and the movie does have moments of comic-book charm. [9 Feb 1996, p.A12]","60","115759"
"7821","Like Shepherd's speech, The American President touches on all manner of issues but illumines none of them. And while there are some engaging glimpses of the president's staff in action...the film's principal pleasures lie in the president's pursuit of a first lady.","60","112346"
"7822","A movie that’s of two minds. It’s well-grounded, but also over the top. It’s a man-vs.-machine epic and also an intimate drama. It’s quirky-smart yet sci-fi silly. And it winds up being half as good as it could be.","60","2209764"
"7823","Picaresque movies often feel longer than they are. For them to work, they need an interior spring with more thrust than Darjeeling's attempt at reconstituted brotherhood. The problem is in Anderson's approach, which is so supercool, it's chilly. Anderson has the attitude for comedy but not the aptitude.","60","838221"
"7824","For all the hype and the inevitable box office bonanza, Terminator 3 is essentially a B movie, content to be loud, dumb and obvious.","60","181852"
"7825","As usual, Tarantino's sense of fun is infectious but fairly heartless.","60","108399"
"7826","Crank’s Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor direct with their usual flashy brio, and basso profundo Keith David has a sublime cameo as a cop indignant at the thought of a pistachio peanut butter sandwich. It’s that kind of movie, folks.","60","1034032"
"7827","This time around, Harry Potter has more to worry about than the Dark Arts -- though parts of The Chamber of Secrets are spellbinding, he seems to be suffering from a bit of sequelitis.","60","295297"
"7828","That it all works to the extent that it does is due to its undeniably sweet depiction of a close-knit extended family whose members truly care for and help each other. It's cinematic wish fulfillment in this era of broken families and far-off relatives who keep in touch via social media.","60","3760922"
"7829","The pacing of Meyers' film sometimes drags a little but like a slow-moving training heading for the end of the line we can see the danger ahead and are powerless to prevent it. This frustration, and a gripping central performance, make My Friend Dahmer a film you can't pull your eyes away from.","60","2291540"
"7830","Though Mr. Holland's handling of his stars is successful enough to establish him as a newcomer with promise, his material here is uneven and often flat.","60","89175"
"7831","There's a degree of puffery in the writing, however, that makes this drama untrustworthy.","60","1024648"
"7832","None of the people in the film is realized as a character: Cronenberg has no interest in character. Each person is given a dab of characteristics and is then sent off to copulate. [21Apr1997 Pg 26]","60","115964"
"7833","A conventional cop thriller leavened with a tablespoon of style and a quarter-cup of garbagey fun.","60","88936"
"7834","Clowning, bullet-riddled rom-com Mr. Right is awfully charming in the best and worse senses of the phrase. It's often kind of awful but also weirdly effervescent, a movie that salves, with its stars' radiance and charisma, even as it grates.","60","2091935"
"7835","All those who have to drag themselves to work every morning will surely find some comfort in Seth Gordon's cheerfully outrageous revenge comedy, Horrible Bosses.","60","1499658"
"7836","The glibness exhausts you, and the Coens are emotionally so far outside their subject that Intolerable Cruelty is finally no different from most of the other dumb slapstick spoofs that pass for screwball comedy these days.","60","138524"
"7837","This solid if unspectacular finish to the Apes trilogy features an A-game Andy Serkis and incredible VFX, but its darker excesses threaten to suffocate at times.","60","3450958"
"7838","It's no first-rank CGI cartoon, but shows how Pixar's quality over crass is inspiring the mid-list. Fun, with teary bits, for kids; fresh and smart for adults.","60","1323594"
"7839","Aaron Sorkin’s indelible wit and naturally fervent performances from Jessica Chastain and Idris Elba prevent Molly’s Game from drawing dead.","60","4209788"
"7840","Bridge of Spies, with its stop-and-go momentum, is also more merely interesting than it is full-on riveting. It's still quite good stuff, but despite its impressive pedigree... it doesn't feel as if it's quite the sum of all of its parts.","60","3682448"
"7841","The movie also has some embarrassing laugh-free stretches, but Faris holds everything together with bubbly intelligence, unexpected line readings, and a few deft pratfalls.","60","852713"
"7842","The screenplay, written by director Peter Landesman and based on books by Felt and John D. O’Connor, does a fine job of condensing a sprawling conspiracy into a digestible feature, although it sometimes favors clarity over nuance and winds up enunciating important plot points in glaringly unnatural dialogue.","60","5175450"
"7843","A gripping, affecting, strange movie -- but oddly, it's just like too many other gripping, affecting, strange movies we've seen recently.","60","366627"
"7844","This is the rough cut of a good movie, and a splendid opportunity wasted.","60","1392214"
"7845","Though there is a lot to see in Inception, there is nothing that counts as genuine vision. Mr. Nolan’s idea of the mind is too literal, too logical, too rule-bound to allow the full measure of madness -- the risk of real confusion, of delirium, of ineffable ambiguity -- that this subject requires.","60","1375666"
"7846","Surprisingly, George Clooney's direction is somewhat underwhelming with crucial conversations oddly lacking in tension.","60","1124035"
"7847","The plot's preposterous and Affleck is way too callow for a role that would have fit Robert Mitchum like a second-hand suit.","60","184858"
"7848","If you are immune to the charms of Carrie and co., this will do little to convert you. Still, it has more than enough sass, style and sentiment to keep the faithful satisfied. Add a star if you're a fan.","60","1000774"
"7849","Fincher is still working on the assumption that he has better things to do than entertain an audience. Which would be fine if he weren't drawn to such schlocky material.","60","119174"
"7850","Singleton shows some genuine talent in handling character and action, and equal amounts of confusion and attitude when it comes to matters of gender and ghetto politics.","60","101507"
"7851","Whether you’re a casual or an ardent follower of M. Night Shyamalan's films, The Happening could alienate or dominate your thinking cap. Remember--it's perfectly acceptable to laugh one second and shriek the next.","60","949731"
"7852","Though Mann and Perry are game, it's Efron who carries the movie.","60","974661"
"7853","Often, the hilarity is indisputably intentional. If you think you'll laugh and clap, try it; if you know you'll hate it, you're right.","60","2334879"
"7854","Scares are often on the generic side (pitch-black doorway, hand reaches out), and while some wild effects work enjoys the zanier side of Hell’s mouth opening up to spit venom across Earth’s surface, it’s missing the masterfully torturous tone that Wan’s universe otherwise aims for.","60","5814060"
"7855","The movie's performances, especially Lathan's, are strong enough to balance out the sometimes-clichéd script.","60","199725"
"7856","Mud is an engaging and good-looking picture with two bright leading performances from Sheridan and Lofland.","60","1935179"
"7857","It's an ambitious, uneven, surprisingly talky melodrama.","60","1027718"
"7858","Most of The Constant Gardener is made with good taste and with respect for its African subjects. But when Fiennes flees a Kenyan village as bandits begin their merciless attack, it's hard not to feel a little uneasy with the medium. We're meant to get a thrill out of the chase, but it's not thrilling. Sickening's more like it.","60","387131"
"7859","Satisfying as it is to at last have Nixon as a Disney character, Hopkins's overheated, self-consciously self-conscious performance doesn't get the overall nuttiness of Nixon's unctuous rage, his iron-butt single-mindedness. [26 Dec 1995]","60","113987"
"7860","After slapstick farces as exuberant and hilarious as Sleeper and Love and Death, it comes as a soft, fuzzy, mildly diverting letdown.","60","75686"
"7861","Not the most sophisticated psychological thriller, yet slick fun.","60","421239"
"7862","""The Final Frontier"" is not as witty as the last installment, nor as well made as ""The Search for Spock."" But it has the Trek essence in spades. [19 June 1989, p.63]","60","98382"
"7863","Much of the three-hour movie takes place in the prison, but the resonant characterization, expansive plotting, and judicious use of exterior locations and flashbacks remove any sense of claustrophobia or sluggishness.","60","120689"
"7864","Dark, detailed and only really gets going when the gunplay starts.","60","430357"
"7865","Widescreen lensing favors tight close-ups, and multiple shoot-'em-ups are edited with panache.","60","110413"
"7866","The Spy Who Dumped Me is no debacle, but it’s an over-the-top and weirdly combustible entertainment, a movie that can’t seem to decide whether it wants to be a light comedy caper or a top-heavy exercise in B-movie mega-violence.","60","6663582"
"7867","Thornton seems born to play the sort of slow-witted poet of the mundane that the Coens find worthy of their condescending affection.","60","243133"
"7868","Though these mismatched cops bounce well off each other, Tatum, in his first comedic lead role, is the better performer, both more riotous and affecting.","60","1232829"
"7869","With all of its excess, Wolf of Wall Street might not rank up there with Scorsese's best, it sure has fun trying.","60","993846"
"7870","LaBeouf somehow manages to turn Kelly's self-centered behavior and irritating character quirks into a sympathetic lead, and the well-written script by newcomer Erica Beeney brings a lot of humor to some very touching moments.","60","357470"
"7871","Unwilling to offend, Zwick whitewashes a culture in which brutality and contemplative beauty were inextricably intertwined and, afraid to alienate audiences, he shies away from the story's logical downbeat conclusion, replacing it with an ""ambiguous"" ending that recalls, of all things, ""The Road Warrior.""","60","325710"
"7872","Gordon is bit too good looking to really be the Greg Heffley the books detail, but he's not obnoxious in the role and will appeal to the target 'tween set.","60","1196141"
"7873","Mostly, the film is heavy-handed, with subtlety nowhere to be found.","60","4196450"
"7874","The film never quite clarifies its own attitude toward Hart. It simply doesn’t spend enough time with him to allow the audience to decide whether he was a truly transformative politician undone by tabloid reporters or just another slick operator. This robs the film of a tragic dimension that it might have achieved.","60","7074886"
"7875","Willis is fine, both as his blond action figure (Zack Morris hair) and actual self, in trusty bruised palooka mode. Mostow does good meat-and-potatoes genre work, coherent even when reckless.","60","986263"
"7876","Men in Black 3 is exactly what you'd expect: amiable mediocrity and nicely laid-back performances with pricy special effects plugging in the gaps where jokes should be.","60","1409024"
"7877","As a film in its own right, this quirky Ray Harryhausen tribute (a skeleton army!) rocks. As an Evil Dead film, though, it’s ultimately not funny, scary or gory enough.","60","106308"
"7878","Its restraint might put off thrill-seekers, but if you can endure the wooden dialogue and sloppy exposition, it musters the entertainment quotient of a middle-order Harry Potter.","60","473075"
"7879","Guest star Dan O'Herlihy steals the film as a Celtic joke tycoon (‘the man who invented sticky toilet paper and the dead dwarf gag’) who hates the way American kids are despoiling the religious spirit of Samhain and decides to teach them a nasty lesson.","60","85636"
"7880","The sheer physical presence of these creatures is much more believable and convincing than what can be generously characterized as the film's plot.","60","163025"
"7881","A manufactured kid-in-jeopardy climax and Blake’s rehab stint blow the mood. Until then, this is great American acting.","60","1263670"
"7882","Beyond its easy-on-the-psyche message, the picture is reasonably pretty to look at.","60","892769"
"7883","The film features plenty of elements that seem familiar from previous cinematic dystopian visions — class warfare, decrepit living, a feeling of terminal velocity — yet you can’t help but admire director Bong Joon-ho’s high-wire act.","60","1706620"
"7884","More pictorially arresting than intellectually coherent.","60","1441395"
"7885","Through two viewings of Jackie, I was never able to pin down whether it was Portman’s performance or Larraín’s way of framing it that left me emotionally shut out.","60","1619029"
"7886","Of course, these movies are supposed to be big, but First Contact is the kind of porky, clumsy thing that would be ignored if it didn't come complete with an enormous guaranteed audience—and if it weren't actually kind of fun in spite of itself.","60","117731"
"7887","It's especially disappointing when the story takes an inevitable turn to starry-eyed mush, dulling the sharp satire of the crazy, stupid ins and outs of romantic entanglement with an unconvincingly saccharine one-true-love-for-all moral.","60","1570728"
"7888","So it may not be Citizen Kane, but it is a hilarious comedy (although not a very believable one — there can be no eight-year-olds this ingenious) that kids will love and adults won’t mind sitting through either.","60","99785"
"7889","There’s probably no real reason for Mary Poppins Returns to exist at all, but now that it’s here, it does at least find some moments of delight even as it travels a familiar path.","60","5028340"
"7890","McDormand could have carried this film all the way through a minefield of touchy topics, singed but with all parts in the right place, primed for a painful laugh. But goddamnit if the cops in this story didn’t ruin all the fun.","60","5027774"
"7891","What keeps this movie honest is the characters, each of them a mass of conflicting instincts, virtues and vices. You know Gonzalez Inarritu comes from outside Hollywood because he doesn't divide the world into heroes and villains.","60","315733"
"7892","With its frank approach to the basics of human desire, its steady, intense focus on a small-town story which could have come straight from Douglas Sirk, Reitman's fifth feature appears to bear little resemblance the four that went before.","60","1967545"
"7893","If you're going to tell a wildly implausible tale of fortune hunting and unlikely heroes, you could do worse than National Treasure.","60","368891"
"7894","You can't roll monstrous boulders straight at audiences any more and have a whole theater-full duck and gasp with fright--and pleasure. We may be plumb gasped out. And although Harrison Ford is still in top form and the movie is truly fun in patches, it's a genre on the wane. [24 May 1989, Calendar, p.6-1]","60","97576"
"7895","THE view of the future offered by Ridley Scott's muddled yet mesmerizing Blade Runner is as intricately detailed as anything a science-fiction film has yet envisioned.","60","83658"
"7896","Beautifully made but emotionally empty, it exists only for the sensation of its provocative moments.","60","116922"
"7897","Sometimes it bounces along, other times it feels forced. Kids and hardcore fans will love it regardless, and those who don't will nonetheless be talking about it for the next three years.","60","121765"
"7898","Being a Mamet, we expect superb dialogue and twists, but we also get refreshingly compact action scenes, even if the climactic airport skirmish is on the pat side. A lesser Mamet, then, but still compelling.","60","360009"
"7899","Like the professional dogwalker who can’t exactly keep count of Max and his cohorts, it feels like the filmmakers are juggling too many chatty creatures at once, while trying to maintain a plot that tends to grow more outlandish as the story progresses.","60","2709768"
"7900","That Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi adore this music is not in question – it’s lovingly chosen and brilliantly performed – but the film sometimes feels like a work of cultural tourism, particularly in scenes set in a gospel church and a Chicago street market. These lively musical sequences also sit awkwardly with director John Landis’s bizarre predilection for wholesale destruction: sure, smashing up cop cars can be fun, but Landis takes things to a tiresome extreme.","60","80455"
"7901","The problem is, the main conspiracy of the show is so vast, you have to walk around it a couple of times before you can see what it is.","60","120902"
"7902","Standard Neil Simon stuff, full of cute grotesques, snappy one-liners, and cheap plays at pathos.","60","76095"
"7903","An off-kilter thriller with a sad-sack hero.","60","118715"
"7904","Escape From New York gets more conventional as it goes along, settling for chases and narrow escapes when it could have had wild social satire as well. Carpenter has a deeply ingrained B-movie sensibility--which is both his strength and limitation. He does clean work, but settles for too little. [27 July 1981, p. 75]","60","82340"
"7905","[Gottsagen's] sensibility infuses the modern-day fable with an engaging forthrightness. But the unequivocal material often sticks close to the surface, and the film built around him, for all its physical sweep, can feel constricted by obviousness.","60","4364194"
"7906","No matter how predictable his arc is, writer-director Thomas McCarthy (The Station Agent) never loses sight of the difficulties of cashflow and making one's weekly nut. You'll want to give his movie-and his secret weapon, the lovably neurotic Bobby Cannavale, as a recent divorcé hoping to co-coach the team-a pass for sweetness.","60","1606392"
"7907","The movie may be a grim warning against the perils of technology and its ability to spew alternative realities, but Cronenberg himself can hardly claim to have his feet firmly planted on the ground.","60","120907"
"7908","The film's mood is so somber and minimal, it might be confused for deep. Had the plot (meager and one-last-job-predictable) zipped along, that wouldn't feel like such a problem.","60","1440728"
"7909","Avildsen draws good performances from the three actors who play PK, as well as from the ever-reliable Freeman and Müller-Stahl, but subtlety is abandoned when he focuses on the ring and teen romance. The climax is a slugging match between PK and a former school bully which would make Rocky proud.","60","105159"
"7910","Compared to McDonagh's best work for stage (""The Lieutenant of Inishmore"") and screen (""In Bruges""), Seven Psychopaths feels like either an older script knocking around the bottom of a drawer or a new one hastily tossed off between more ambitious projects.","60","1931533"
"7911","Blade's stomach-turning special effects, bone-crunching martial arts and cynical humor will more than satisfy any action-film addict's need for a fix of eye-popping escapist adrenaline.","60","120611"
"7912","A cluttered, awkward blockbuster that's just smart enough to get itself into trouble.","60","343818"
"7913","The mystery surrounding the Slones and their missing child is much less interesting than Core's burgeoning friendship with the local sheriff, Donald Marium (James Badge Dale), who assists with the investigation.","60","5057140"
"7914","It would be difficult to invest in if not for its two main stars who work hard to elevate the overly engineered plot, filling in the emotional gaps left by the haphazard script.","60","7985692"
"7915","Dimples, wigs, bazooms, and all, Dolly Parton is phenomenally likable as the madam; her whole personality is melodious, and her acting isn't bad at all, even though the director, Colin Higgins, has made her chest the focal point of her scenes.","60","83642"
"7916","Fonda’s relentless interrogating, mannered chain-smoking and enforced two dimensionality cause her to become tiresome very early on. She remains a brittle cliche of a modern professional woman. Bancroft gives a generally highly engaging performance as a religious woman too knowledgeable to be one-upped by even the craftiest layman.","60","88683"
"7917","Director Fred Walton sets the audience up early for a 20-minute reign of terror and gracefully shocks them out of their seats in a final blitz. But he packs the middle with drawn-out dialogue and mindless series of chases and escapes that do little more tan pad the feature film into feature length. [19 Oct 1979, p.31]","60","80130"
"7918","It's an entertainingly cynical small movie. Aaron Sorkin's dialogue tumbles out so fast it's as if the characters want their brains to keep pace with their processors; they talk like they keyboard, like Fincher directs, with no time for niceties.","60","1285016"
"7919","Origins is an accomplished slice of comic-book entertainment, full of fights and action set-pieces impressive for a director touching big budget for the first time.","60","458525"
"7920","Even when Griffin has a heart of stone, Tim Robbins is lacking in the knid of ice-cold magnetism that allows a thorough bastard to hold the screen like nobody's business. [10 Apr 1992]","60","105151"
"7921","Bad Words soars in the bits of riotously offensive chitchat between Guy and a young Indian hopeful (Rohan Chand); it wobbles in plot developments involving the effortlessly starchy Allison Janney as the contest’s “queen bee”; and it splats in the I’m-secretly-hurting conclusion.","60","2170299"
"7922","Expertly captures the details and textures of the time without condescending or lapsing into cheap-shot parody.","60","106677"
"7923","Too much time is spent on the forced romance between O'Keefe and Holcomb, an attractive waitress, however, and the slapstick becomes utterly mindless toward the end (as if the producer said, ""Okay, it's time for this film to really get out of control!""). Still, the laughs keep coming.","60","80487"
"7924","Paris, Texas begins so beautifully and so laconically that when, about three-quarters of the way through, it begins to talk more and say less, the great temptation is to yell at it to shut up. If it were a hitchhiker, you'd stop the car and tell it to get out.","60","87884"
"7925","Dune is a huge, hollow, imaginative and cold sci-fi epic. Visually unique and teeming with incident, David Lynch's film holds the interest due to its abundant surface attractions but won't, of its own accord, create the sort of fanaticism which has made Frank Herbert's 1965 novel one of the all-time favorites in its genre.","60","87182"
"7926","While Bad Boys for Life has a completely asinine story, generic action, predictable plot beats, moronic dialogue and truly reprehensible politics, I still had a good time.","60","1502397"
"7927","More an absurdist comedy than a horror film, Evil Dead II is a flashy good-natured display of special effects and scare tactics so extreme they can only be taken for laughs.","60","92991"
"7928","Like an entire season of peak television crammed into the space of two hours, Mary Queen of Scots spares us not only the butchery but also a great deal of the drama that might explain how the misfortunate monarch came to find her neck on the line.","60","2328900"
"7929","Although it is impudent, bold, and often very funny, it lacks the sense of order (even in the midst of disorder) that seems the special province of successful comedy.","60","66026"
"7930","Visually, [the film] often is exhilarating, but it's shapeless and dragged down by corny, melodramatic characters and situations.","60","101393"
"7931","A feminist sitcom tricked up with garish violence and garrulous hit men.","60","171580"
"7932","The plot has many twists, few surprises, and one gaping hole, which becomes apparent only after you walk out of the theater and have a chance to think. But pure popcorn like this is hardly worthy of serious analysis...Fortunately, the stars have not lost their charm and authority.","60","70735"
"7933","There is no evidence of life outside the immediate world of the movie.","60","104348"
"7934","For Trek devotees, it's a supernova of unpredictable sci-fi thrills, though the earthbound may find this trip through the heavens a bit tiresome, especially when the movie tries too hard to wax philosophic. [18 Nov. 1994, p.88]","60","111280"
"7935","Superman IV: The Quest for Peace doesn't attempt to disguise its sentiments - no more so than Greenpeace - but neither does it lose the campy spirit of the 1978 original. Although never as stylish as the first movie, it shows verve and a modest wit. Superman IV is not as funny as the first sequel, but it isn't as violent, either. [27 July 1987, p.1D]","60","94074"
"7936","The film, which Barrymore produced, is meant to be a charming coming-of-age story, but it plays a little too sweetly for its own good.","60","151738"
"7937","If you can overlook the obvious flaws -- a bumpy beginning, a villain whose motive is both too obvious and hard to swallow -- The Bodyguard has its flashy, shallow pleasures. There's some wit in Kasdan's script, and plenty of dread in the big Oscar-ceremony climax (reminiscent of ""The Man Who Knew Too Much""). When it works, it's like watching a paranoid edition of ""Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous."" [30 Nov 1992, p.80]","60","103855"
"7938","This Grand Guignol riot of rotting animal and Godless creations is great fun. However, of the cast, it is only McAvoy, walking the line between madman and genius, who fully manages to hold his own against the spectacle with which he shares the screen.","60","1976009"
"7939","A slickly crafted fable, however dark, but it's shot with haunting poetry.","60","212720"
"7940","Predictable, cutesy and surprisingly short on genuine humor, Legally Blonde gets by thanks to the magnetic presence of Witherspoon.","60","250494"
"7941","Sheer energy and audience allure to burn, even if numerous speed bumps cause many of the comic possibilities to go tumbling overboard.","60","207201"
"7942","So there are two films here: one is frightening and poignant and the other tender but slight. The first one will haunt me even if the second will fade.","60","8652728"
"7943","Stylistically, the film is all in small talk, too -- those television-perfected moments of everyday life that evoke recognition, rather than curiosity, about human behavior. But there's nothing in their lines or behavior that would make any of them irreplaceable in this sort of friendly group. [22 May 1981, p.17]","60","82405"
"7944","A sharply observed but bleak examination of family dysfunction, anchored by solid performances.","60","757361"
"7945","Establishing character, conflict and environment with astounding economy in the film's first ten minutes, Rees demonstrates the sort of filmmaking chops and personal storytelling (the director claims she drew on her own coming-out experience) that suggests the low-key epiphanies of Amerindie cinema at its best.","60","1233334"
"7946","Sadly Lewis lite and not without flaws but this is as Burtonesque as one could wish for, a real treat for fans of his twisted imagination and great British character actors.","60","1014759"
"7947","Daring and unique on the one hand, but hard to swallow on the other, Prophecy is a fantasy thriller about murderous angels waging a war on Earth. First-time director Gregory Widen deserves a pat on the back for attempting risky balancing act.","60","114194"
"7948","This sequel to Planet of the Apes isn't bad, but degenerates the original conception into routine comic strip adventure.","60","65462"
"7949","I wanted to believe in Bad Santa. At least half of the time I did.","60","307987"
"7950","This is not a “fun” horror picture. It’s about miseries both supernatural and mundane. And, yes, it’s scary. Pesce’s art-film roots are evident in the movie’s slow-burn first hour. But in the final third, The Grudge piles on the explicit gore and jump scares — all leading to a final scene and final shot as terrifying as anything in the original series.","60","3612126"
"7951","The good news about the amiable but only partly satisfying Tin Cup is that it frees Kevin Costner from playing a monument and restores to us the loose, sparkling comic actor he used to be. [19 August 1996, p.66]","60","117918"
"7952","There are countless more fascinating facets to this city than the work of cops with crime and countless more striking characters in it than genial detectives and mumbling crooks. However, within that range of interest, Mr. Hellinger has done a vivid job in this, his appropriate valedictory, which comes to you spontaneous and unrehearsed.","60","40636"
"7953","Like last winter's ""Pleasantville,"" this movie juxtaposes classic virtues against modern mores. The former did so with far more invention.","60","124298"
"7954","The truth is that “Rocky IV” and Creed II sharing the same cinematic universe requires supreme suspension of disbelief. But taken as descendants of the original, “Rocky IV” is the delinquent you never talk about, while Creed II at least knows how to keep the family business humming.","60","6343314"
"7955","Has a ghoulish wit. It's not as cheekily knowing as the ""Scream"" movies or as trashily Grand Guignol as the ""Evil Dead"" franchise, but like those pictures it recognizes the close relationship between fright and laughter, and dispenses both with a free, unpretentious hand.","60","309593"
"7956","Plenty of shrewd commercial calculation went into concocting the right sugar coating for this story of an 11-year-old girl's painful maturation, but chemistry seems right. Laurice Elehwany's script neatly handles a number of details but on larger matters falls into predictable patterns.","60","102492"
"7957","The Jason Bateman comedy model hasn’t quite been radically altered in Game Night but it’s one of his more entertaining outings. Just don’t count on remembering much of it once the night is over.","60","2704998"
"7958","It ends up as a sweet-enough movie, and one that’s full of joy and invention – but also one that feels like a lot of effort has been put into serving a tale that maybe doesn’t fully deserve it.","60","5208216"
"7959","An odd one. Rogen's latest clown is an angry, confused man who you never feel entirely comfortable laughing at. There are laughs -- you'll just feel guilty afterwards...","60","1197628"
"7960","All the virtues of the original... are present here, though when Cameron tries to milk some sentiment out of the ""personality"" and fate of his top machine he comes up flat and empty, and the other characters are scarcely more interesting.","60","103064"
"7961","Fine performances and bristling language compel in this overlong, often off-putting but well-observed New York story.","60","466893"
"7962","Not up there with the best King adaptations, but a fun Gothic yarn that, like all good ghost stories, is simple and dripping with dread.","60","450385"
"7963","Purists will find the pic's obviousness disappointing, but there's no question that the film delivers a sufficient shock quotient to satisfy its youthful target audience.","60","130018"
"7964","Perhaps you have to have lived through the 1960s to relate.","60","165854"
"7965","A laudably amoral and superbly caustic comedy for those who like their satire strong and unfiltered.","60","427944"
"7966","iIt's far less sickly than plenty of yuletide offerings, last year's ""The Family Stone"" being one shudder-worthy example.","60","457939"
"7967","The problem, dare I say it, is that the movie just ... isn't ... that ... funny.","60","910936"
"7968","Dante plays the early scenes perfectly, racking up the clammy dread without tipping over into outright nastiness.But somewhere along the way, the tension dissipates.","60","1085779"
"7969","An imperfect, messy and sometimes trying film that has moments of genuine sweetness and humor sprinkled in between the saccharine and the sadness.","60","822832"
"7970","Though his movie wraps challenging ideas and ingenious visual conceits in a futurist film-noir style, it's pretentious, didactic and intentionally but mercilessly bleak in ways that classic noir never was.","60","181689"
"7971","Beresford's nice little movie seems so afraid to make a false move that it runs the danger of not moving at all. [07 Mar 1983, p.78B]","60","86423"
"7972","It's full of scenic splendors with a fine sense of scale, but its narrative thrust seems relatively pro forma, and I was bored by the battle scenes.","60","120737"
"7973","I appreciate that Payne is more interested in blowing out a middle-class American perspective, and its perpetual victimhood narrative. But Damon is completely forgettable here — I suspect that’s by design, but nothing about him commands you watch him the way you watch Chau or Waltz.","60","1389072"
"7974","It’s certainly Redmayne’s film, and his performance is everything you could ask for: completely convincing in its physicality, credible in its pain, and warmly but not crassly optimistic in its nearly constant good temper.","60","2980516"
"7975","Jeffrey Caine and Bruce Feirstein's script promises more fun than it delivers, slowly frittering away its store of jokes and thrills.","60","113189"
"7976","William Shatner's Kirk is less stoic here than in III--he's pleasantly daffy. The others in the crew also have an easy, parodistic tone. But the picture doesn't have much beyond the interplay among them and the jokey scenes in San Francisco.","60","92007"
"7977","F. Scott Fitzgerald was wrong: there are second acts in American lives. But all too many of them are sad, sordid or both, as this fact-based story of sex, drugs and murder featuring adult-movie superstar John Holmes aptly demonstrates.","60","335563"
"7978","The best new addition to the corp is Alan Cumming’s Nightcrawler.","60","290334"
"7979","Best of all, an astonishing sequence in which Bugs, Daffy and Porky Pig leap from painting to painting in a breathless chase through the Louvre sufficiently demonstrates just how much life modern animation techniques can breathe into these timeless characters.","60","318155"
"7980","Packed with plenty of heart and relatability — and a powerhouse performance from Jack Lowden — it never fully resolves the tension between the grit and glamour of the wrestling worlds the Knight family inhabit.","60","6513120"
"7981","Friday may touch its young target audience. For everyone else, it is more intriguing as a social problem than a movie.","60","113118"
"7982","A ""Blair Witch""-y creepshow that owes a lot to Japanese horror.","60","1179904"
"7983","Slick and often funny, but the smugness of the satire and the stunted emotions are finally wearying.","60","73692"
"7984","An allegorical fable of fascism and slavery, CONQUEST OF THE PLANET OF THE APES is the best of the four sequels in the hugely successful APES series, as well as being the darkest and most violent.","60","68408"

"7986","It's a brisk, colorful, infectiously charming but instantly disposable Hollywood entertainment. It's fun, like watching kids play dress-up in the back yard -- nothing more, nothing less.","60","108333"
"7987","If you boil the psychology of Collateral down to its essence, what you get, mostly, is Vincent badgering Max for not having enough chutzpah -- in essence, for not being enough of a tough guy.","60","369339"
"7988","In the end, nothing about The Interpreter strikes us as very original.","60","373926"
"7989","Although the movie has its moments -- particularly when our hero finds himself surrounded by a gimlet-eyed circle of futuristic detectives -- it's never really successful.","60","119177"
"7990","Malick dangles his maddeningly innocent ideas about life and death and man's gift for self-destruction.","60","120863"
"7991","Midway through The Lost Boys there's a brief scene that suggests the magic and power it could have had. This scene suggests a fable of seductive evil-but nothing in the movie is ever half as evocative again. It's more lost than the Boys: a glossy fiasco with most of the real blood sucked out of it.","60","93437"
"7992","Any kid growing up in the early ’60s will remember this one for several reasons: Birley Shassey’s screamer of a theme; Bond’s shocking use of a beautiful girl as a human shield; bullion-obsessed baddie Auric Goldfinger’s top hat-wielding henchman, Oddjob; Honor Blackman’s risquely monikered Pussy Galore; and, above all, Bond’s stupendous, gadget-infested silver Aston Martin DB5, the car that spurred a thousand Corgi purchases.","60","58150"
"7993","It's hard to hate a movie that affectionately references the oeuvre of Kathryn Bigelow (both The Hurt Locker and Point Break!) and uses a whiny Third Eye Blind ballad as an acidic punch line.","60","1622547"
"7994","A horror film with the power to put a rascally grin on the face of that great genre subverter John Carpenter (They Live), Get Out has more fun playing with half-buried racial tensions than with scaring us to death.","60","5052448"
"7995","The most ambitious horror blurs the line between the psychological and the mythic, between ordinary human emotions and symbol-laden Blakean nightmares, and Aster is very ambitious and very blurry.","60","8772262"
"7996","As a movie it was never wholly successful, mainly because it was saddled with all the excesses of the second season of the TV show; but for converts, this is still unmissable.","60","105665"
"7997","As sci-fi, it feels like a professionally produced hybrid that lacks its own identity. As a romance, it never fully earns your investment.","60","1355644"
"7998","Without a doubt, hard hitting and thoguhtful, but Clarke's style here (as it would continue to do) hints at something altogether more disturbing.","60","113540"
"7999","Though it’s still a disappointment in relation to its two predecessors, it has much to recommend it. It begins and ends brilliantly.","60","88993"

"8002","Awake is a pleasing if negligible diversion.","60","211933"
"8003","The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai: Across the 8th Dimension doesn't play it safe. For that alone you may want to bless its demented little heart. Buckaroo Banzai may not work, but that's the risk of high-wire acts. At least it's up there trying. [20 Aug 1984, p.75]","60","86856"
"8004","A silly comic book movie with provocative psychological overtones. Or a provocative character study with silly comic book overtones. Take your pick. Either way, it's hardly the cinematic milestone it's widely hailed as being.","60","316654"
"8005","While few of the paper-thin characters register long enough to make much of an impression, Diesel carries the movie.","60","232500"
"8006","The first and third acts are over-busy; the middle one moves like an arthritic house-elf. Still, a decent smattering of magic moments and tension's pumped up sky-high. Bring on Part 2.","60","926084"
"8007","Miss Sloane is a shallow but lively thriller which becomes undermined by its makers’ misplaced belief in the profundity of their topical tale.","60","4540710"
"8008","Melancholy 16-year-olds are the ideal audience for It's Kind of a Funny Story, which actually feels as though it were made by an especially precocious adolescent.","60","804497"
"8009","The film sets a quirky tone and sustains it until a very bizarre and contrived ending.","60","157503"
"8010","Don't misunderstand: the proceedings are pretty silly, and the scares were a lot fresher back in 1979, when we first saw ""The Amityville Horror."" But Cornwell and his cast take things just seriously enough to keep us at least intermittently on edge.","60","492044"
"8011","(Diesel's) Riddick, a silver-eyed, musclebound escaped killer, is the most sequel-worthy sci-fi creation since the Terminator.","60","134847"
"8012","Mike Leigh's latest film preserves the mystery of why another marriage has flourished over decades. That's not the stated subject of Another Year, but it's at the center of this enjoyable though insistently schematic comedy.","60","1431181"
"8013","Watching it is akin to be being waylaid by an expert raconteur. There is the curious sense that it has told this tale before; that every joke has been honed and rehearsed; every anecdote lovingly polished in advance.","60","3741632"
"8014","Directed by E. Elias Merhige, the film is never less than entertaining, but Sir Ben's portrayal of a sympathetic psychopath gives it a special zing.","60","324127"
"8015","Unfortunately, the committee-designed script never finds a consistent balance between building characters, delivering action and pushing the story forward.","60","800369"
"8016","Cheesy? Certainly. But strong performances and a heart-warming storyline make this a winner.","60","106611"
"8017","Solid performances by leads James Caan and his humanoid buddy-cop partner Mandy Patinkin move this production beyond special effects, clever alien makeup and car chases.","60","94631"
"8018","Harrelson and Maura Tierney, who plays Monix's love interest, seem to be inhabiting a different, more interesting, movie, one that follows the familiar path of a has-been athlete seeking redemption at what looks like his last stop. The strange thing is that the subplot is so tangential to the rest of the movie that the scenes could be omitted with no one the wiser.","60","839980"
"8019","Foxtrot is a movie from Israeli writer-director Samuel Maoz that is structurally fascinating yet also structurally flawed: its accumulations of ambiguity and mystery are jettisoned by a whimsical final reveal.","60","6896536"
"8020","After lightly going through the motions of a plot, it all ends up in the quarry, where assorted machinery provides the excuse for a parade of slapstick gags and amusement park-like predicaments that seem mostly lumbering.","60","109813"
"8021","I'd trade much of The Master for one extraordinary moment played by the ever-improving Amy Adams, in front of the bathroom mirror with Hoffman.","60","1560747"
"8022","It's not nearly as much fun as the action-packed trailer makes it seem.","60","120616"
"8023","The funniest moment comes when Carrey mimes the effects of the Mask without special effects.","60","110475"
"8024","See-saws between straight superhero movie and parody, with layers of soap-opera fudge in between. A lot of solid scenes - but Hancock lacks the power of super-coherence.","60","448157"
"8025","For all its flaws, Bright is still a headlong leap into a bracingly different new world. Cinema could do with more of that.","60","5519340"
"8026","A sci-fi which balances big themes and claustrophobic action with apparent ease.","60","74812"
"8027","Taylor does capture the Jim Crow era and its anxieties well, but his characters tend toward the facile and his white heroine is too idealized.","60","1454029"
"8028","Directed and played with terrific verve, this moves so fast from one special effects set-piece to the next that there's no time at all to reflect on the basic ridiculousness of its Chinese box of a plot.","60","96874"
"8029","They've taken material with the power to insinuate itself directly into the realm of the imagination, and made it strangely inert and lifeless.","60","120603"
"8030","The Debt shortchanges itself severely with the weight it gives the portion of its story set further in the past.","60","1226753"
"8031","Everything from time travel to melodrama figures in this whimsically daft story, a romanticization that tries your patience even as your tear ducts well.","60","97351"
"8032","At its shambling best, Office Space is like a bracing break at the coffee machine. Some horrible Monday, why not cut work to see it?","60","151804"
"8033","The best scene is when Hellboy and Abe get drunk and sing out raucously, which after ""Hancock"" suggests a trend toward superhero alcoholism.","60","411477"
"8034","Beauty And The Beast lacks some of the astonishing visual prowess of previous Disney live-action remakes, but still sings and dances with enjoyable style.","60","2771200"
"8035","Ultimately it's left to Mad Max wizard Miller to steal the show with an extraordinary remake of Richard Matheson's story about an airline passenger who spies a demon noshing the starboard engine.","60","86491"
"8036","Manchester-by-the-Sea is a study of family dysfunction and the worse loss imaginable, but one held back by the fact it’s all filtered through Affleck’s withdrawn lead.","60","4034228"
"8037","Coppola, in attempting to elevate the material, doesn’t seem to realize that The Beguiled is, and always was, a pulp psychodrama. Now it’s pulp with the juice squeezed out of it.","60","5592248"
"8038","Jennifer Lopez carries this thin concept about as far and as well as she can, with Alex O'Loughlin in his first leading-man outing managing not to get lost in the shuffle.","60","1212436"
"8039","Ironically, Alien is not a bad movie. In fact -- here's the rub -- it's too interesting to make an exciting summer flick.","60","103644"
"8040","It's Sarah Polley through and through: slightly too glum for its own good, but reeking of quality and feeling.","60","491747"
"8041","If The Hudsucker Proxy is a triumph, it is a zombie one. Too cold, too elegant, too perfect, more an exhibit in a cinema museum than a flesh-and-blood film, ""Proxy's"" highly polished surface leaves barely any space for an audience's emotional connection. [11 Mar 1994, p.1]","60","110074"
"8042","First Reformed is a deeply felt, deeply thought picture; impressive in its seriousness and often gripping in the way it frames itself as a debate and a sermon.","60","6053438"
"8043","The Elephant Man has great dignity, sweetness and compassion in this portrait of an unlucky monster who must fight to make other humans recognize his humanity. But it lacks dramatic punch and repeats its effects rather than developing a truly complex texture. [06 Oct 1980, p.71]","60","80678"
"8044","All That Jazz is great-looking but not easy to watch; Fosse's indulgent vision at times approaches sour self-loathing, and nothing like the explicit open-heart surgery had been seen on mainstream American screens, let alone the morbid song-and-dance routines in an operating theater.","60","78754"
"8045","No one is going to explain any of this for you — and the slightly snobby implication of Upstream Color is that explanations are for suckers.","60","2084989"
"8046","A film that tries to be too many things at once - funny but not campy, sad and scary, a horror story and a human tragedy","60","91064"
"8047","The movie just ping-pongs between empathetic chuckles at Helms's charming social awkwardness and putting him through a raunchfest ringer.","60","1477837"
"8048","Only God Forgives is the spectacle of a brilliant young director spinning out in style. It’s a beautiful disaster.","60","1602613"
"8049","The Nines arcs from witty Hollywood insiderdom to a climactic metaphysical leap that may leave many viewers nonplussed. Nonetheless, there's more than enough intelligence, intrigue and performance dazzle to make this an adventuresome gizmo for grownups.","60","810988"
"8050","It's gorgeous, lush and fun, but there's an underlying silliness to the endeavour which, despite occasional archness, constantly threatens to trivialise events.","60","4550098"
"8051","Carrey's schizophrenic new effort gives you both at once -- it drowns his hilarious physicality in an ocean of sap.","60","315327"
"8052","Though it's aimed at preschoolers, it's tuneful and funny enough to amuse any adult.","60","298388"
"8053","The songs are routine, but the inconsequential plot leaves plenty of time for engaging asides like the blandly silly dinner-table dialogue between a well-bred couple (Cleese and Sanderson) determined not to notice that their home has been invaded by little furry creatures.","60","82474"
"8054","There’s plenty of warmth and compassion here, and the true story is a belter, but this ‘Lion’ doesn’t quite roar.","60","3741834"
"8055","There are moments that make the whole enterprise worthwhile, and introduces an intriguing new Batman. But it’s also cluttered and narratively wonky; a few jokes wouldn’t have gone amiss, either.","60","2975590"
"8056","The actress, wielding a pair of swords like a chef from Benihana, remains a striking action heroine, though she's more convincing visually -- those taut thighs are weapons unto themselves -- than vocally.","60","432021"
"8057","It should be disastrous. But psycho ground controllers (Stack and Bridges), laff-a-second pace, and bludgeoning innuendo make this the acceptable face of the locker-room satire.","60","80339"
"8058","A rather titillating take on a racy historical novel, this is perhaps too ambitious in intent. More time, or more pruning (perhaps they should just have focused on The Boleyn girl), would have produced a richer and more enjoyable film.","60","467200"
"8059","Despite its shortcomings -- it’s still one of the better teen movies to come along in a while.","60","377092"
"8060","It tootles along being cute and fluffy like a twentysomethings' version of Sabrina The Teenage Witch, but to further its notions of sisterhood and the power of women, it also takes a spin through Thelma And Louise territory, then revisits The Exorcist to up the supernatural content. It's enough to make your head spin.","60","120791"
"8061","Looked at now (2017), The Graduate is frankly a film you admire more than actually enjoy experiencing. Dark, pitiless and despairing, it plays stranger and more distant to me today than it did back in the day. So much so that one wonders if that was the plan from the beginning, when the fact that its mildly transgressive attitude seemed fresh and new disguised its essential nature.","60","61722"
"8062","Hyams the director (""Sudden Death,"" ""Timecop,"" ""The Star Chamber"") operates at too much of a fevered pitch for things not to eventually get out of hand -- accelerating violence and horror eventually hit maximum velocity and warp into nonsense, no matter how erudite the script.","60","120004"
"8063","Her Smell is built around a performance of near-unwatchable toxicity by Elisabeth Moss, who channels a combination of Courtney Love and Heath Ledger’s Joker with her spiteful, slowly imploding rock star.","60","7942742"
"8064","If the filmmakers opt to make only light statements about junk food, obesity and solid waste, they at least leave the audience sated on a single serving of inspired lunacy.","60","844471"
"8065","Compared with (""The Sixth Sense""), there's no contest. Stir of Echoes has been outrun and outclassed.","60","164181"
"8066","A beautifully acted but disappointingly stiff period drama.","60","1441953"
"8067","Russell follows ""The Fighter"" with a softer, soapier family dysfunction drama, lightly comic enough to make for palatable Friday-night viewing. As its nutty lovebirds, Cooper and Lawrence save Playbook from the director's surprisingly mundane impulses.","60","1045658"
"8068","In its zeal to pay proper respect to Mexican traditions and to avoid any hint of appropriation, Coco fails to give as much attention to its perfunctory characters or mediocre plotting, resulting in a family film which is reverent rather than inspired.","60","2380307"
"8069","The gallows humor is entertaining, despite some rather braod roughhouse effects.","60","46359"
"8070","As goofy and throwaway as the ""Brady Bunch"" movies, but it has the same winking appreciation of vintage kitsch.","60","118655"
"8071","Despite all the flash and filigree, this monster movie is curiously -- and conspicuously -- lacking in heart.","60","120685"
"8072","Hancock's apparently irrepressible penchant for folksy Midwestern types and perky montages dilutes any cynicism or misanthropy that might have given this material the edginess it deserves.","60","4276820"
"8073","Strong on stunts and special effects but often rambling and ponderously lurching into comedy, it's not the greatest of Christmas treats, but does have enough cherishable moments between the wordy longueurs; and in Lysette Anthony's Princess Lyssa, a heroine for whom many a young Turk would walk through fire and ice.","60","85811"
"8074","Characterization and emotional investment, however, are in disappointingly short supply, while crucial tension is permitted to dissipate in an anti-climactic final third.","60","4062536"
"8075","Michael Douglas in Solitary Man, has all the tools of the man who plays him at his disposal. At times in this often engaging, occasionally meandering movie, that's enough to score.","60","1294213"
"8076","Ben Affleck probably respects Lehane the genre writer (there are five books with Patrick Kenzie as the hero) more than he should. He also has some way to go before he becomes a good director of action.","60","452623"
"8077","Comic book stuff, helped out by the presence of Rae Dawn Chong as an airline stewardess whose sarcastic commentary adds some comic counterpoint to the deliberately overscaled action.","60","88944"
"8078","This adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's novel is commercial to the core.","60","134119"
"8079","There's an itch for this kind of material, and here it is scratched -- to the bone.","60","758746"
"8080","This is a wholly accessible story that most filmgoers will find pithy and generally well done.","60","1433810"
"8081","A spectacular natural disaster spiraling out of control, a crime gone wrong and a poor jerk caught in the middle: Yes, it's a standard action-picture recipe. But what a difference a cast makes.","60","120696"
"8082","In the final reel, the tension dissipates with a flabby hiss, as the film devolves into a banal, conventional ghost story.","60","298130"
"8083","The film catches her long after she's left the public eye, and rather than an examination, or an assessment, of her politics, it instead offers up an affecting if not always satisfying portrait of the strong-willed leader humbled by age.","60","1007029"
"8084","Certainly delivers violence and heroics, but not in a way everyone is going to enjoy -- it's brutal and harrowing.","60","340163"
"8085","Fails to add anything of substance to the history that it portrays.","60","870111"
"8086","Another mean, violent and decently acted slab of Ellroy-flavoured criminality, with an impressively battered Keanu Reeves, but Ayers is no Curtis Hanson.","60","421073"
"8087","A Red Dawn for the Tea Party era, Olympus Has Fallen is pretty ridiculously entertaining—or at least entertainingly ridiculous—for long stretches, dulled only by the realization that there are many parts of the country where this will play as less than total farce.","60","2302755"
"8088","Marsh's movie is calm, level, downbeat. The tension is subtle – perhaps subtler than it really should be.","60","1770734"
"8089","Broader than Bad Santa and less consistently funny, it's still gleefully rude, crude and often a lot of fun.","60","1284575"
"8090","Comic book movies have spent a long time striving to be taken as serious, grown-up entertainment but Thor: Ragnarok is almost an admission that you can’t play this material straight. This is probably the wisest strategy with Thor.","60","3501632"
"8091","The costumes are phenomenal, the set design ravishing and the sadistic inventiveness extraordinary.","60","209958"
"8092","Talk about style over substance: The sheer volume of musical, comic-strip and video-game influences, riffs and licks in ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" can get exhausting, but they also are what lift this romantic coming-of-age tale from this world to someplace totally ... else.","60","446029"
"8093","The film's most memorable character is the perpetually stoned surfer played by Sean Penn. His confrontations with Mr. Hand (Walston), a draconian history teacher, provide the film's finest moments.","60","83929"
"8094","While this adaptation of Waller's treacly bodice-ripper leaves out a lot of the lurid excess, it is not altogether free of pomposity.","60","112579"
"8095","Precious is painful, it is harrowing, it is emotionally exhausting. It is also a singular film, one that is as difficult to compare to another as it is to forget.","60","929632"
"8096","You may salute Lone Survivor for its desperate intensity; but the film remains pinned down by its military and political dilemma: between gung-ho and F—, no.","60","1091191"
"8097","If the slightly generic Yes Man is symbolic of the new, happier Jim Carrey, then it is a small price to pay for his piece of mind.","60","1068680"
"8098","Everything looks professional if undistinguished.","60","822849"
"8099","This film could have done with a few more mouth beats and unlikely moments of extracurricular celebrity.","60","1981677"
"8100","Scott Thomas breathes more emotion into Juliette's affectless, haunted demeanor than most actors do with pages of dialogue.","60","1068649"
"8101","The resulting slowdown, as well as a significant narrative shift, gives Looper a slightly sprawling and ungrounded feel at times, almost as if the first and second halves are two separate movies.","60","1276104"
"8102","Like most of the recent exports from Apatown, Get Him To The Greek -- aka Russell Brand’s My Filmy Wilm -- is patchy, but home-run hilarious from time to time. If only it didn’t detour into darkness so often, this could have been a genuine treat.","60","1226229"
"8103","The jittery aesthetic is a bit grating - there's a three-cut minimum per roundhouse kick - but the spectacularly named Olivier Megaton (Transporter 3) still manages to deliver the action-film goods.","60","1657507"
"8104","If you like stuff breaking in THX, Swordfish delivers like no other this year. Bring earplugs.","60","244244"
"8105","Annabelle works enough devil figurine juju to make for a modestly hair-raising prequel to the more satisfying scares of its predecessor, ""The Conjuring.""","60","3322940"

"8107","Perhaps stifled by the cultural and commercial clout of its source material (a multimedia juggernaut of books, movies, television shows and a stage musical), Death Note feels rushed and constricted.","60","1241317"
"8108","If you’ve seen ""Species,"" you know where this don’t-mess-with-Mother-Nature horror show is going, though director-cowriter Vincenzo Natali has a few interesting twists up his sleeve.","60","1017460"
"8109","Pekar's autobiographical chronicle of day-to-day banality is a rich, if dingy, tapestry of ordinary life in all its infinite, homely peculiarity, which filmmakers Sheri Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini bring to uniquely eccentric life.","60","305206"
"8110","An uneven but often energizing remake of David Cronenberg’s 1977 cult classic.","60","5628902"
"8111","It's a movie about the warm feeling you get when you belong to a family, and, throughout, the thermostat is turned up high.","60","114924"

"8113","This is acting that chills the heart beyond any possibility of warming.","60","105323"
"8114","The dazzle doesn't make up, however, for the movie's lack of depth.","60","120660"
"8115","Third Person’s considerable strengths generally come from the actors.","60","2343793"
"8116","The Karate Kid can't really brushoff the conventional showdown it's incited, so the movie adds the obligatory action payoff to its less expected and more substantial rewards. The filmmakers can't help overbalancing on melodramatic excess from time to time, but their mistakes never obliterate the civilized wisdom of Miyagi's outlook: ""Have balance, everything be better.""

"8117","Gets by on quirky charm and slacker chic-but just barely.","60","115734"
"8118","It's a good job this works so well as a machine-made movie, because its grasp of political realities is nebulous.","60","119395"
"8119","Director Paul Anderson, whose last film was ""Mortal Kombat,"" well knows how to build suspense and increase tension. But counterbalancing all of that is Event Horizon's position as a sci-fi splatter film, intent on drenching the screen in blood and gore whenever possible. [15Aug1997 Pg 16]","60","119081"
"8120","This start for Gregory as producer and Laughton as director is rich in promise but the completed product, bewitching at times, loses sustained drive via too many offbeat touches that have a misty effect.","60","48424"
"8121","To accept the film, though, one must first understand its point of view, and that is maddeningly difficult. All we know for certain is that Do the Right Thing is not naturalistic. [July 3, 1989]","60","97216"
"8122","Finally though, it is Van Peebles who runs New Jack City aground. The film ends up being slightly long, both in terms of time and self-righteousness. Van Peebles is to be commended for making such a hip morality lesson, but New Jack City's finale, which is predictable and trite, could have been handled more creatively by a more daring director. [12 Mar 1991, p.1D]","60","102526"
"8123","A live-action cartoon without dramatic focus, a solid structure or discernible theme.","60","132347"

"8125","More interested in finding fresh ways to stage execution scenes than in finding meaning behind the human urge for self-appointed righting of wrongs, (the film) is stuffed with effects that have no lasting impact.","60","144117"
"8126","Stone creates such a sizzling, raunchy, vital world that the cliches almost seem new.","60","146838"
"8127","Intense direction (Pekinpah) coupled with assured acting (McQueen).","60","68638"
"8128","A touching melodrama illuminated by a solid turn from Tatum.","60","989757"
"8129","It’s the right role for Cruise, but the movie is so devoted to him, so star-driven, that it begins to seem a little demented.","60","407304"

"8133","Lithe, bold, often funny and full of characters to cheer for, it never pretends to be anything more than a trigger-happy romp. If that’s what you’re after, The Losers offers plenty of explosive entertainment.","60","480255"
"8134","Busier, messier and thinner than its predecessor...the studied hipness can get so pleased with itself it borders on the smug.","60","349903"
"8135","It's good to see Schwarzenegger doing his thing again after what, for him, was a long sabbatical.","60","146675"
"8136","There is a lunatic energy about it. Every once in a while, Chayefsky abandons the struggle to dramatize his ideas and has somebody, usually Holden, just turn to the camera and spout off. In those moments, his concern — and sometimes his mother wit — comes blazing through and the picture takes on a life not found in safe, sane, well-calculated movies.","60","74958"
"8137","Clooney may be a specialist in embattled camaraderie--he helped revive ""Ocean's Eleven,"" after all--but as in that caper remake, there's no depth to these characterizations, and Downey and Clarkson are squandered in a goes-nowhere subplot about their secret marriage.","60","433383"
"8138","It may not entirely work as a movie, but The Muppets shines as a piece of touching pop nostalgia.","60","1204342"
"8139","It's an acceptable, play-it-safe version of the first volume in the hugely popular Veronica Roth-written trilogy.","60","1840309"
"8140","Despite its admirable strengths and the fact of it being a true story, there is somehow a failure to completely connect with the fierce boy, giving his unhappy and alienating youth an unfortunate air of unreality.","60","108330"
"8141","There's no questioning the strength of Lee's polemic nor the social and political observations that ""Bamboozled"" offers, yet as a piece of film-making it is undeniably flawed.","60","215545"
"8142","Ultimately, The Strangers does succeed in the sense that it offers a riveting, vastly credible enactment of everyone's worst nightmare.","60","482606"

"8145","Buoyed by a distinguished cast of horror veterans, Bloch's well-written script, and Baker's deft direction, Asylum is the most satisfying of the horror anthologies of the 1970s.","60","68230"
"8146","The result is a satisfyingly gritty tale, more grounded in reality than many entries in the franchise.","60","381061"
"8147","It’s a simplistic film in some ways, with a naive ending – but there is energy and vigour, too.","60","8267604"
"8148","I sat through ""Courage"" with interest, but I wasn't particularly moved or riveted with suspense.","60","115956"
"8149","Unlike Romero’s film, what’s missing is a trenchant sense of connection to our historical moment.","60","455407"
"8150","Rolling Thunder certainly has enough to recommend it to Walking Tall fans with strong stomachs. But moviegoers yearning for a sensitive attempt to graft the nation's most recent scar tissue onto the screen will have to wait. [04 Nov 1977, p.11]","60","76637"
"8151","Even though this feature debut for director Matt Spicer, who co-wrote the script with David Branson Smith, is sort of all over the place, it’s still often sharply amusing, crisply assembled and features game, broad-brushstroke performances from leads Aubrey Plaza and Elizabeth Olsen.","60","5962210"
"8152","A peculiarly hollow, centerless blend of theatre and literature, from which what’s missing, for the most part (though not entirely), is precisely the cinema...It isn’t so much that The Third Man is a bad movie—far from it. But it’s far from being a great one, too.","60","41959"
"8153","Director Curtis Hanson keeps the hugely complicated story zooming along the boulevard of broken dreams without losing sight of the details that make the trip worthwhile.","60","119488"
"8154","What spares Learning to Drive is an awful lot of comedic talent and artistic good will. Clarkson and Kingsley imbue average material with easy charm and wit, clicking onscreen with the smooth platonic chemistry of old friends.","60","3062976"
"8155","Has a quiet sense of community, a wry, unsentimental sweetness, that grows on you. It's a patient movie for impatient times.","60","120824"
"8156","The film has one indelible asset: Mark Strong, who plays the Jordanian spymaster Hani. He's sleek and lounge-lizard sharp like a young Andy Garcia, and he could be bigger than Garcia. The Jordanian holds all the cards, and opposite two superstars, Strong is the only actor who holds the camera.","60","758774"
"8157","Ready to Wear is all appetizers: the main course never arrives. Still, the critical savagery puzzles me. Altman's movie may be indefensible, but it's not unenjoyable. The fun of it is entirely superficial, like skimming a gossip column.","60","110907"
"8158","Unwieldy, long-winded, self-indulgently nutso and, in places, very, very boring. It also caps off its two-and-a-half-hour run time with an extended finale – partially orchestrated to David Bowie's ""Cat People"" theme song, no less – that I could watch again and again with pleasure","60","361748"
"8159","Astonishing visually and problematic dramatically.","60","253474"
"8160","It is a film with charm and the chemistry between Jones and Redmayne has something rather platonic and even sibling-like, but that isn’t to say there isn’t a spark of sorts.","60","6141246"
"8161","Lost City is the acme of a 21st century prestige picture. Sadly, however, it is one that is also deeply flawed. Gray’s most ambitious movie yet is marred by a story arc that fails to rise or reach a climax, unnatural-sounding expository dialogue, and an unforgivable lack of thrills.","60","1212428"
"8162","Shamelessly stirring, brandishing Mr. Gibson's anguished masculinity like a musket. It may be effective, but you leave the theater feeling used.","60","187393"
"8163","In a film that's carefully crafted but also airless and overcalculated, Mos Def walks away with every scene he's in because we're never sure what his character is up to, and we're never told.","60","361127"
"8164","This is a case of good acting saving a movie from its own poor choices.","60","3640682"
"8165","Writer-director Tom McLoughlin, who made the scare entry One Dark Night, puts comic spin on some of the predictable material and turns in a reasonably slick performance under the circumstances.","60","91080"
"8166","For the right audience, it'll be fun. It's for action movie fans with a taste for something off the beaten track -- but not too far. And for people who like to rail and spew against the vulgarity and stupidity of TV -- but keep watching it all anyway.","60","93894"
"8167","Not a film for everyone, but if you're in the mood for a little sensory overload, some spirited intellectual gymnastics and an introduction to the most intriguing new actress Europe has produced in years, get in line with the rest of the thrill-seekers.","60","211915"
"8168","Fails to rouse any passion. A potentially great subject is frittered away, though this being a Scott movie, there's style to spare.","60","320661"
"8169","The film bears its real-world resonance as lightly as a button, thanks both to the steady supply of well-turned one-liners and the rippling chemistry between Nanjiani and a never-better Kazan, who’s so disarmingly funny here that I kept catching myself pulling puppy-dog faces whenever she was on screen.","60","5462602"
"8170","It’s unfortunate that the result is so unaffecting, especially in light of all the things the director does right.","60","432283"
"8171","Schrader certainly has his finger on the pulse of the times, and the universally strong performances do ample justice to his sensitive ear for dialogue. But the story meanders, and it echoes Taxi Driver and American Gigolo so closely that Schrader is working less than fresh variations on over-familiar themes. For all the film's conspicuously adult intelligence, it elicits a disappointing sense of déjà vu.","60","102307"
"8172","Despite a twisty, juicy and compelling story, there remains a staid conventionality that keeps the political and thematic undercurrents from being explored as satisfyingly as one might hope.","60","1398426"
"8173","Mr. de Palma has ordered universal overacting. Piper Laurie does it with considerable grace—the wicked witch in a children's pantomime. The marvel, though, is Sissy Spacek. She makes us perfectly aware that she is overacting, and yet she is very effective. Her hysteria is far too hysterical. Her delight in being taken to the prom is far too radiant. But it moves us.","60","74285"
"8174","The film's final dialogue exchange reveals The Change-Up to be one long setup to a bromantic joke that, in a roundabout way, maybe comes closer than any previous film to fulfilling that woebegone subgenre's implicit homoerotic endgame.","60","1488555"
"8175","While ""Twilight"" will make more money and get more attention, the darkly comic Cirque du Freak boasts the shaggy charm of the natural underdog.","60","450405"
"8176","The adults do little more than provide marquee allure in brief bookending scenes that add little to rest of the pic. For the most part, Now and Then is a showcase for four fine actresses in their early teens.","60","114011"
"8177","Even when they don't always add up, these are movies in which De Niro can shrug off the burden of being Robert De Niro. Where the star who was Travis Bickle can again freely assume the part of the great character actor -- if only this time to ask, ""You laughin' at me?""","60","289848"
"8178","Doesn't hit a home run on every action sequence -- an early bit set in Colombia is too long and too disjointed -- but there are one or two bits in the movie's latter third that are guaranteed to hook action fans.","60","295701"
"8179","Malick's long, moody, diaphanous account of love and loss in 17th-century Jamestown--shot, more or less, on location--rarely achieves the symphonic grandeur it seeks. As an epic, it's monumentally slight.","60","402399"
"8180","It’s a star vehicle that starts and ends with its star, the film around him struggling to justify its existence. Efron is wicked, the film less so.","60","2481498"
"8181","The latest Halloween installment is fun while it lasts, but unlike its predecessor, it’s not a classic for the ages.","60","1502407"
"8182","The movie telegraphs its intentions too early and relies too much on a single actor, Johnny Depp, to achieve its emotional force.","60","363988"
"8183","The humor of two clerks arguing about ethics and sex deflates before the halfway mark, but the writer-director, Kevin Smith, dishes up some funny profanity in his low-budget black-and-white debut.","60","109445"
"8184","The crud and petty desperation of The Cooler is enjoyable as atmosphere, and the movie is passionate. [12 January 2004, p. 86]","60","318374"
"8185","The simmering implication of incestuous emotions between Lili and Roy, leading to the shocking denouement, is badly underdeveloped and mishandled, leaving a lingering sense of anti-climax.","60","99703"
"8186","Neither a debacle nor a bore, The Departed works but only up to a point, and never emotionally--even if the director does contrive to supply his version of a happy ending.","60","407887"
"8187","The movie is funny without being much good; mostly, it’s another rung on Ms. McCarthy’s big ladder up. It’s a fitful amalgam of bouncy and slack laughs mixed in with some blasts of pure physical comedy and loads of yammering heads. There isn’t much filmmaking in it, outside of Ms. McCarthy’s precision comedic timing and natural screen presence.","60","2702724"
"8188","Watching Ali, you can be sure of experiencing two opposing things: a sterling performance from Will Smith as Muhammad Ali and a bewilderingly punch-drunk movie from Michael Mann.","60","248667"
"8189","Not for anyone with a sensitive gag reflex. Joshua Marston provides a harrowing depiction of drug- muling for dummies. The raw, revolting, dangerous details of such an undertaking are graphic.","60","390221"
"8190","The nonstop pace may eventually numb viewers to the thrills, although Spielberg must be congratulated for adding some shades of character to his archetypal action hero this timearound.","60","87469"
"8191","A moderately clever dystopian mindbender with a gratifying human pulse, despite some questionable narrative developments along the way.","60","1483013"
"8192","The movie is strongest is when it strips away the facts and focuses on the emotional notes.","60","1196956"
"8193","It’s fun, though GOTG2 doesn’t have the same sense of weird urgency and point that the first film had. They’re still guarding, although the galaxy never seems in much danger.","60","3896198"
"8194","A labor of love, to be sure, but a simple, small-scaled domestic drama with none of the broad appeal of the hugely popular ""Shakespeare in Love"" of 1998, this thoroughly respectable Sony Classics pickup will command the interest mostly of older-skewing art house habituees.","60","9206798"
"8195","The revelation of the film's mystery just barely makes sense. Yet, we dismiss it as an extended MacGuffin, and thus can delight in the film's devious turns.","60","362478"
"8196","Quills is bound to titillate some, but for most it's likely to summon little more than a few Oscars and appreciative yawns.","60","180073"
"8197","Admirable in many ways, Coming Home succumbs to the same American lust for romance and heroism for which it implicitly condemns its doomed Marine captain. [20 Feb 1978, p.87]","60","77362"
"8198","Mr. Englund, playing the Halloween favorite whom audiences love to hate, now delivers lines like this with the broadness of a latter-day Jimmy Durante. But he sustains Freddy's peculiar charm even when appearing without ghastly makeup in scenes of Freddy's early years.","60","101917"
"8199","Francis Ford Coppola's take on the Dracula legend is a bloody visual feast. Both the most extravagant screen telling of the oft-filmed story and the one most faithful to its literary source, this rendition sets grand romantic goals for itself that aren't fulfilled emotionally, and it is gory without being at all scary.","60","103874"
"8200","Brad Pitt has fun with his secondary part as a pontificating lunatic, but I wish I'd enjoyed the rest of the cast more.","60","114746"
"8201","So little wit is expended on the dialogue and so much on the imagination of disaster that you may as well sit back and enjoy the jolting ride.","60","112864"
"8202","Bullock delivers a towering performance that grabs the movie and the Oscar race by the scruff of the neck. You will be moved, but at the price of any nuance or complexity.","60","878804"
"8203","There’s not much fault to find with Sicario on the level of craft or performances, just its rather sputtering momentum, and the lack of a higher purpose.","60","3397884"
"8204","Though overstretched and a trifle ponderous, this is a solidly acceptable star vehicle with more than enough righteous vengeance for an evening of classy thrills.","60","455944"
"8205","The Good Dinosaur emerges as a visually breathtaking work of computer-generated animation that is ultimately unable to compensate for a disappointingly derivative script.","60","1979388"
"8206","An uncommonly satisfying mix of medieval fantasy, high-tech military action and ""Mad Max""-style misadventure.","60","253556"
"8207","An idealized tribute to a charismatic teacher who has devoted his entire life to music appreciation, Mr. Holland’s Opus has the same old-fashioned texture as Goodbye, Mr. Chips. Older audiences will be moved by the story, but the crucial variable is to what extent younger viewers will embrace this schmaltzy, Capraesque saga that’s not only set mainly in the past but also feels as if it were made back when.","60","113862"
"8208","Coogler, who grew up in the same neighborhoods as Grant, evokes a tangible sense of place, and his staging of the climactic incident hits like a fist in the gut. It’s not enough to wipe out his reduction of this real-life figure into a composite-character martyr or the lukewarm filmmaking that’s come before, even if you’re left shaken all the same.","60","2334649"
"8209","Unlike the ronin, the heroes of a Japanese legend, these guys are still searching for a story.","60","122690"
"8210","Unknown is probably the movie ""The Tourist"" wanted to be, if it had a pulse. Its sheer momentum makes Neeson and Kruger more attractive than even Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie.","60","1401152"
"8211","The movie withholds a crucial bit of back story in early scenes only to drop it like an anvil later on. Since the revelation is known to the characters the whole time, the decision to deploy it as a surprise is cheap and shameless — a blatant foul in a movie otherwise filled with smoothly executed plays.","60","8544498"
"8212","While Caruso will fail to win over adult reviewers, I Am Number Four will connect with teen moviegoers anxious for a new young adult fantasy fix to hold them until the next ""Twilight Saga"" hits in November.","60","1464540"
"8213","Bloodshot runs out of meta tricks before it is over, and David S.F. Wilson, who borrows his visual vocabulary from Tony Scott and Michael Bay, delivers action sequences with such choppy continuity that viewers may be as confused as Ray. He deserves bonus points, however, for embracing silliness.","60","1634106"
"8214","Although it, too, is gorgeous to look at, this skeletal thriller is as direct and spare as its Mennonites. [08 Feb 1985]","60","90329"
"8215","The first-rate cast cannot be faulted. Chandor has assembled an extraordinary ensemble.","60","1615147"
"8216","An enthralling, enjoyable if ultimately far-fetched thriller.","60","408790"
"8217","As it is, No Strings Attached is content to be sweet rather than edgy, to make you go ""awww"" instead of ""hmmm.""","60","1411238"
"8218","Remains mired in a smart-alecky film-school sensibility.","60","86979"
"8219","Brand ultimately can't make a watered-down Arthur as sweetly charming as the original, but he certainly makes it better than it would have been otherwise.","60","1334512"
"8220","The performances, even those by trained actors like Mr. Ramirez and Ms. Majorino, have the hesitant, blinking opacity that some directors look for in nonprofessional casts. Their awkwardness is charming, and part of the point of the movie, but it also makes for some dull stretches and thwarts your ability to regard the characters with sympathy rather than mere curiosity.","60","374900"
"8221","It’s absorbing for a long while, at least half its two-hour running time — an evocatively photographed soap opera with actors who are impossibly gorgeous and yet human-looking — but it goes on and on, piling on twists, adding devices so clunky they’d have embarrassed most nineteenth-century problem-dramatists, refusing to jell despite the actors’ prodigious suffering.","60","2404461"
"8222","An action melodrama that doesn't trust its action to speak louder than words.","60","68473"
"8223","A satire for its time. What Judge is less sure of here than in his previous, perfectly pitched live-action comedy ""Office Space,"" is how to build a complete movie around his key ideas.","60","387808"
"8224","Sin City 2 glowers and sulks and is determined to show you the best bad time you’ve had in years. It’s neither high art nor noir, but it’s what a Sin City film should be.","60","458481"
"8225","Always effortful and desperate to impress, The Lion King may serve as a virtual substitute for going to the zoo (don’t slide down the Black Mirror cynicism of that idea), but let’s hope it never replaces such outings, nor its 1994 forebear, a passport to something far more sublime.","60","6105098"
"8226","The film is best when Gekko and Fox power it up, but Wall Street falls into the red when Stone's heavy-handed moralizing takes over.","60","94291"
"8227","Plot is not the movie’s strong suit. But stylish set pieces are, including one epic blast-a-thon alongside a pool.","60","2911666"

"8229","Allows the supporting cast to steal the movie.","60","159365"
"8230","Essentially a late-'90s MTV version of ""The Exorcist,"" a half-serious, half-silly piece of business that keeps us involved despite (or maybe because of) being more than a little overdone.","60","145531"
"8231","Cox's style is a step beyond camp into a comedy of pure disgust; much of the film is churlishly unpleasant, but there's a core of genuine anger that gives the project an emotional validation lacking in the flabby American comedies of the early 80s.","60","87995"
"8232","Often it feels like reading a Twitter thread of ideas and hashtags, rather than watching a movie. Yet the final act, a “Purge”-like blood bath to the tune of vengeance, is aesthetically arresting.","60","6205872"
"8233","Vaughn can motormouth like a machine gun, spraying men, women and children with manic, rat-a-tat outbursts of toxic insincerity. It's often dirty, yes. But it's also manic and inspired.","60","396269"
"8234","The action sequences are still pretty imaginative, if not nonsensical.","60","804461"
"8235","The editing, too, is rough around the edges, but it all adds to the sense of madness that pervades El Salvador – a sense that only grows the more intense the further that Boyle journeys into this Central American heart of darkness.","60","91886"
"8236","Early on, Lumet wastes too much time characterizing Newman, following him from bar to bar to bar. Though Newman plays a good drunk, his performance is far from intoxicating. When he rests his case, the jury goes to sleep. [17 Dec 1982, p.19]","60","84855"
"8237","Director Steve Miner, on board because Carpenter passed, made two of the early Friday The 13th sequels and manages the business of the sudden knee-jerk shocks with ease, realising (as the previous sequels didn't) that Halloween movies are supposed to be scary not violent.","60","120694"
"8238","Little more than the distended first half of a twisty, dark ""Law & Order"" script.","60","327056"
"8239","It can be funny, but the humor is too often based in stereotypical perceptions of Asians (they're short, they're laughably polite, they eat weird food), and Coppola shamelessly invites us to laugh along with Murray's character, who, believe it or not, thinks it's hilarious when his hosts get their ""r""s and ""l""s switched.","60","335266"
"8240","Wingard has the technique to pull this homage off, and the sense to build unease from somewhere in the core of America’s psyche.","60","2980592"
"8241","Lynch and his film will surely be reviled, but as an experiment in expanding cinema's dramatic and technical vocabulary, Blue Velvet demands respect. [Sept. 22, 1986]","60","90756"
"8242","Adults also are more likely than kids to snicker at jokes.","60","120587"
"8243","Okja is plenty of fun, and smart around the edges, but the girl-and-her-pig stuff can drag, and it feels like it’s pressing for resonance more than properly achieving it.","60","3967856"
"8244","In trying to compose a poetic love letter to a time of liberation and freedom, Haynes has merely conjured up memories of druggy excess, egotism and tight trousers. The only mementos worth saving from the experience are available on the soundtrack.","60","120879"
"8245","If the film has a problem, it's that the Farrelly brothers, co-writers and directors, seem content to bunt for long stretches between home runs.","60","129387"
"8246","I enjoyed it immensely, flat-footed dialogue and implausible situations and all. Which doesn't stop me from believing that in its totality Secretariat is a work of creepy, half-hilarious master-race propaganda almost worthy of Leni Riefenstahl, and all the more effective because it presents as a family-friendly yarn about a nice lady and her horse.","60","1028576"
"8247","Brooks, who directed and cowrote with Monica Johnson, is irrepressible but always very human.","60","89504"
"8248","To enjoy the film's arresting musings on language, time and how much we can ever understand others, you'll have to close your eyes and ears to the wealth of schlocky hokum surrounding them.","60","2543164"
"8249","It isn't a great film, or even a greatly original one. Still, it has many grace notes, and interesting oddities.","60","287978"
"8250","The Year Of The Matrix will be remembered as an indulgence for fans, while the original movie will be affectionately held as a separate entity by a bigger crowd, much as the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy hasn't really been tainted by divisions over Episodes I and II.","60","242653"
"8251","A fun, disposable watch.","60","1453405"
"8252","Simply put, the clockwork heist that Ocean’s 8 promises (and, by its end, dazzles with) limits the film’s ability to offer what you might actually want from it: the chance to relish this cast.","60","5164214"
"8253","For those not hip to its smug ""out is in"" mentality, Dirty Girl's redeeming feature is its cast. Temple is vixen enough to carry the part, but manages to project a real wit burning beneath the layers of makeup and dumb-blonde shtick her character affects around others.","60","1107319"
"8254","Despite its downbeat context (a plague at its height), the movie is a crowd-­pleaser — graceful and funny enough to distract you from its gaps and elisions.","60","790636"
"8255","Even if you can forgive the crude JAP caricatures (et tu Minnie Driver?) and the blatantness of the film's attempts to make you sob, you're still left with lovely actors stuck in a lackluster cover version of the real thing.","60","1423894"
"8256","Despite Zellweger’s appealingly warm, vulnerable performance, the film itself is a mixed bag.","60","1473832"
"8257","A blockbuster that offers enough quirky pleasures to feel fresh and unpredictable.","60","259324"
"8258","She has real sympathy--characters that might have been brittle, mockable creations in another writer-director’s hands gain resonance here. But the filmmaker also might have very little to say apart from the way guilt enters into life, and then suddenly recedes.","60","878835"
"8259","Caustic and despairing, Shrader's film lacks the delicate beauty of Atom Agoyan's ""Sweet Hereafter,"" but has just as much bitter power.","60","118564"
"8260","It's a stunning, dazzling motion picture that somehow, almost unaccountably, has the magnetism of a slab of corned beef. [20 May 1988, p.6]","60","96446"
"8261","Like a fridge whose door’s been left open overnight, the film doesn’t feel chilly enough. It’s not terrible, but fans of the book may well be disappointed.","60","3631112"
"8262","The sticking point of the movie is its exorbitant length: two and three-quarter hours does seem like an awful long time to patch up a horse, and a movie that goes straight for your heart should not be allowed to fester.","60","119314"
"8263","If, like the filmmakers, you're willing to settle for a myth that flatters your sensibilities and shortchanges the past, you're likely to find some agreeable kicks here.","60","109707"
"8264","As high-class cheese goes, Truth slips down fine. It’s a noisy, one-note rally for the converted that gets your pulse racing even if you’re rolling your eyes.","60","3859076"
"8265","Shyamalan's great gift is the creation of atmosphere, the conjuring of spooky, unseen menace. When he gets around to doing this in Signs, all is well, but it's a tossup as to whether the film offers enough of a payoff considering how long it takes to get where it's going.","60","286106"
"8266","Yet while Schumacher has largely accomplished the goal of delivering a cinematic comic book, he's also left the movie hollow at its core -- a distinction that may not trouble Saturday-night audiences but that nonetheless dulls the film's impact beyond its sheer and unrelenting visual grandeur.","60","112462"
"8267","For all the blasphemies and British accent, Pinhead is just a sub-Freddy goon, and the ambiguities and perversities Barker is so fond of have been neatly tidied-up. This is the sort of picture teenagers in malls in Akron, Ohio might understand — a good horror sequel, and that's all.","60","104409"
"8268","Breathlessly paced and surreally funny, ‘The Boxtrolls’ fizzes with visual invention and wild slapstick. But the grotesquerie is overbearing.","60","787474"
"8269","Bancroft and Mortensen take home the acting awards -- the pleasure they take in what they're doing really makes the film come alive.","60","119173"
"8270","The film is sometimes too sentimental, too predictable in its drift, but electric in individual moments.","60","3841424"
"8271","The film is neither intelligent enough nor silly or grotesque enough to become a lasting favorite.","60","1054606"
"8272","In the end, even in the howling high frequencies and the nihilistic night, this R-rated movie misses its best shot. It doesn't talk hard enough. [22 Aug 1990, p.5]","60","100436"
"8273","The first forty minutes or so are – as you would expect – a harrowing recreation of the bombing and the crime.","60","7280898"
"8274","May be too grisly to extend its appeal beyond its fan base.","60","187738"
"8275","While it does deliver some good jolts, it never quite cranks up the terror.","60","283632"
"8276","García Bernal's irrepressible charm provides a burst of welcome energy with each brief appearance.","60","892318"
"8277","But there's something timid about the way in which Ernest Thompson has adapted his witty play for the screen version of On Golden Pond, as if it had to do an extra-hard job to prove itself appealing. [22 Jan 1982, p.17]","60","82846"
"8278","No one would accuse it of breaking new ground, or finding fascinating new paths across its well-worn prison yard. But Sauvaire’s drama is lean and trim and unwavering in its task.","60","4080956"
"8279","The performances are absurdly broad, and each story line is more outlandish than the last. But De Felitta’s approach is so easygoing, and the waterside setting so irresistibly charming, you’re bound to walk out in a great mood. How many movies can do that for you?","60","1174730"
"8280","These are brilliant impersonations, the kind that can only be achieved by exceptionally intelligent actors; the superb technique of both is matched by their obvious love for the originals.","60","3385524"
"8281","Trumbo may be clumsy and overly simplistic at times, but it’s still an important reminder of how democracy can fail (that is, when a fervent majority turns on those with different and potentially threatening values), and the strength of character it takes to fight the system.","60","3203606"
"8282","Working off source material that is very different from its predecessor, anyone expecting a straightforward Shining sequel will be disappointed. This isn’t a gruelling exercise in pure horror. It’s odder and more contemplative, but worth checking in.","60","5606664"
"8283","Former pop promo director Sena knows how to give a glossy sheen to the blank surfaces and rough edges of roadside America, but the results look cheap and shoddy rather than seductively challenging.","60","107302"
"8284","It would like to be ""Traffic"" with guns, but comes out more like ""Blow"" with bullets.","60","399295"
"8285","It’s not a film to break moulds or test boundaries. Yet Jackman’s real charm will carry you along.","60","1485796"
"8286","Simultaneously a contrived piece of hokum and an absorbing, old-fashioned mystery.","60","309698"
"8287","What makes the film work is the double act between the two actors, and some great one-liners that pepper the script and cover up the fact there isn’t a great deal of originality in the plot.","60","103241"
"8288","Clearly a great event, Forrest Gump is not, however, a great film. It has the form of an epic without real depth or resonance; the trappings of satire without a coherent attitude; and the semblance of historical revisionism without a critical sensibility.","60","109830"
"8289","Demme’s Manchurian Candidate is far from a disgrace, but it's not freewheeling enough, not strange enough to make sense of our gathering dread.","60","368008"
"8290","An oddly schizophrenic fantasy thriller that ultimately succumbs to a fatal case of sentimentality.","60","186151"
"8291","The fourth remake of this story, this is a fairly good, though overlong, film.","60","75265"
"8292","Rob Reiner directs with deftness and sincerity, making the material seem more engaging than it is, at least until the plot machanics begin to unwind and the film starts to seem shapeless.","60","98635"
"8293","Next to Gump, the film has the moral force of a George Steiner essay, but what lends it that force are not the carefully calibrated moral ambiguities of the script, but the bruised, defiant soul that appears to us in the form of Denzel Washington.","60","1907668"
"8294","Genndy Tartakovsky is a talented director who knows how to telegraph what an animated character is thinking and doing and how to move a character in ways that suggest personality.","60","2510894"
"8295","The enthralling dance numbers-flashy spectacles with feathers and bras made out of pearls and netting-and the combined sass levels of Cher and Christina Aguilera gloss over the movie's weaknesses.","60","1126591"
"8296","As it is, it’s an aloof conclusion, an unclimactic climax to a stand-alone film.","60","378194"
"8297","Equilibrium improves as it rolls along -- either that or, ironically, it wears down the senses until the viewer succumbs.","60","238380"
"8298","Nancy Sinatra sings the wistful title song, and the action scenes are enhanced by some of composer John Barry's best work for the Bond series.","60","62512"
"8299","The real love story in Mighty Joe Young, however, is the one between lumbering, big-hearted Joe and his feisty blond protector, and that's a romance to which audiences of all ages will happily respond. [2 Jan 1999]","60","120751"
"8300","Pfeiffer digs into the role and won't let go. The rest of the movie is conventionally earnest.","60","120646"
"8301","Thornton is sadly affecting in the film's central role.","60","117666"
"8302","Luckily, Hawke and Delpy remain as charming as ever, and their combined goofiness is more endearing than annoying. Winning, too, is the sense that this peculiar project, though imperfect, could grow old with its audience and its cast.","60","2209418"
"8303","This The Other Side of the Wind has a haphazard “well, he shot it, so we better include it” vibe. One wonders just how much of the existing editing Welles got to oversee himself; the answer is: probably not much. There’s a tight, 80-minute feature trapped in The Other Side of the Wind, one that Welles most likely would have exhumed had he not run out of money while filming.","60","69049"
"8304","National Lampoon's Vacation is a comedic cross-country adventure like no other, thanks to Chevy Chase and the rest of the Griswold family. It's not the best Vacation movie by any stretch, but it's a wild ride from start to finish.","60","85995"
"8305","Mistress America is hit-and-miss. It’s not as burdened by blame as other Baumbach films — Gerwig leavens him. But it’s labored.","60","2872462"
"8306","Sellers's performance—as the innocent neuter figure who rises accidentally to political power on the strength of vacant homilies—is remarkable. But Ashby's direction is marred by the same softness that made The Last Detail and Coming Home so morally bland.","60","78841"
"8307","A pretty good thriller for the first forty minutes or so. [25 Aug 1997, p. 24]","60","118571"
"8308","Mallrats mixes clever bits and an appealing quirkiness (which goes a long way) with gross-out practical jokes, needless repetition and obvious padding, since it has no real plot. [20 Oct 1995]","60","113749"
"8309","On a plot level, concoction is too derivative of Flashdance for its own good, as the premise once again is untrained, but highly skilled and imaginative, street dancers versus the stuffy, inflexible dance establishment. Aside from the fainthearted choices, however, film is quite satisfactory and breezily entertaining on its own terms.","60","86998"
"8310","Masterpieces of literature-to-film are a rare breed; this film falls short with satisfaction.","60","810784"
"8311","There are a few surprises in Frankie, and the movie, in its placid way, wants to deliver a tug of revelation of what life is about. The trouble is, life at the end of this day doesn’t look very much different than it did at the start of the day.","60","8019694"
"8312","The story of a teen desperate for a father figure who finds encouragement from a wild-and-crazy water-park employee -- rather than from the guy auditioning to be his stepdad -- can be explosively funny in parts, but overall feels pretty familiar, relying more on its cast than the material to win favor.","60","1727388"
"8313","Frustrating though it can be, Spanglish still proves to be as resilient as its characters.","60","371246"
"8314","Built on dry one-liners, off-kilter timing and self-conscious nostalgia, The Kings of Summer seems expressly designed to delight quirk-loving Sundance audiences.","60","2179116"
"8315","The film is spectacularly constructed, from intimate closeups to dizzying chase scenes. But as is often the case with this format, the motion-capture animation feels weirdly lifeless.","60","983193"
"8316","This is a movie nasty enough to kill off the major characters twice and still manage to serve up a happy ending.","60","120201"
"8317","What the film most damagingly lacks though is a sense of mystery and danger.","60","293508"
"8318","The movie is engrossing and well-acted throughout (especially Khan), but ultimately leaves us less optimistic about the prospects for peace.","60","829459"
"8319","This is the kind of movie in which it's considered the zenith of meta-wit to have a slumming Robert De Niro (as Machete's racist politico nemesis) drive a taxi.","60","985694"
"8320","The primary drawback is the lack of chemistry between the leads, Reese Witherspoon and ""Twilight's"" Robert Pattinson.","60","1067583"
"8321","There's nothing new under the sun, but About Alex is very, very not new. Luckily, most of its capable cast muster the warmth we require, and Zwick's script offers more humor (however mild the laughs are) than sentimentality.","60","2667918"
"8322","Visually stunning, thoroughly belligerent and as shallow as a pygmy’s paddling pool, this is a whole heap of style tinged with just a smidgen of substance.","60","416449"
"8323","A brutal fusion of angst and action, this mini-epic gives the sword-and-sorcery genre a bleak, brusque new life. Watch it for some terrific limbchopping and a mighty turn by James Purefoy.","60","970452"
"8324","Us is too confidently made, too expert in its scene-to-scene command, to call it an example of sophomore slump. Still, after the film reveals itself to be the home-invasion thriller it is (and then the lesser Invasion of the Body Snatchers it becomes), you feel a slight letdown.","60","6857112"
"8325","It’s the writer, Diablo Cody, and the director, Jason Reitman, who have screws loose. Or maybe they’re just desperate to make their film a chick ""Rushmore"" or ""Garden State.""","60","467406"
"8326","It's enjoyable poppycock.","60","155267"
"8327","Though Submarine isn't a dull head-movie, amid the bells and whistles, Roberts seems less its star than its cameraman.","60","1440292"
"8328","Even amid all the campy, uneven creepiness The Fog unleashes, you have to give it up to Carpenter for continuing his knack of making women just as ready as men to get into heroic, survival mode whenever some strange shit goes down.","60","80749"
"8329","This beautifully composed picture brings a robust physicality to tried-and-true source material, but falls short of the sustained narrative involvement and emotional drive its resolutely old-fashioned storytelling demands.","60","1568911"
"8330","It all adds up to a decent movie — one that, for those in the know, stands in the shadow of a better one.","60","4558376"
"8331","Brad’s Status is a frustrating concoction. There’s a script full of insight but also inanity and while the performances might jump out, the direction falls flat. Stiller is back on the right route but, like Brad, he could afford to take a more daring detour every now and then.","60","5884230"
"8332","While lacking the richness of its source material, it remains an enjoyable, immoral and sometimes beautifully Gothic tale.","60","360486"
"8333","Romantics of any age will probably succumb to Depp's deft portrayal, cinematographer John Schwartzman's fantastic vision and Berman's comic wordplay. [23 Apr 1993, p.5]","60","106387"
"8334","Strikingly picturesque locations and a terrific ensemble cast help this tonally inconsistent adaptation of Posy Simmonds's comic series pass by with relative ease, though it leaves a very peculiar aftertaste.","60","1486190"
"8335","Unfortunately the pacy humour of the first half soon dwindles to a weak climax, and Pryor hams shamelessly, yet again proving that he's best in serious parts or as a stand-up man. Enjoyable, nevertheless.","60","86393"
"8336","The scenery, effects and balletic, iconic combats are perfectly wonderful, but there's an emotional black hole where the hero should be.","60","121766"
"8337","The screenwriter, James Solomon, does the poor job only a liberal could at making the case for a Cheneyesque ""dark side,"" and he isn't helped by Kline's wooden acting. Too bad. The Conspirator is eloquent enough to let the other side have its say.","60","968264"
"8338","Richard Jewell’s greatest feat is the generous emphasis it places on its Forrest Gumpian do-gooder’s complex sense of humanity; if only there were more of that to spread around to the other characters.","60","3513548"
"8339","You'll be happier with the film if you don't expect fidelity to source material, but that doesn't mean you'll hate it if you loved Niels Arden Oplev's movie.","60","1568346"
"8340","Unfortunately, something at the center just doesn’t hold, and it flies apart over the course of 133 minutes into confusing shards of plot, legalese-heavy monologues and, perhaps most surprising of all given Gilroy’s bona fides, a touch of soggy sentimentality in the home stretch.","60","6000478"
"8341","There are several solid laughs and some excellent supporting performances. But this is a film to be wary of.","60","84805"
"8342","Amid all the hokey hill stuff, Lawrence's hard eyes and manner draw us in.","60","1399683"
"8343","It is fantastically silly, often funny, with some unshowy but very serviceable digital effects.","60","1525366"
"8344","As a thriller, The Butterfly Effect is iffy and uneven, but as a portrait of a people, it's effective and intriguing.","60","289879"
"8345","With all its boardroom bickering, the plot is a gun that shoots mostly blanks. G3 is too faithful to the deliberate pacing of the first two films: the slow walking into a dark room, the silence surrounding the threats... The film is a slow fuse with a big bang. [24 Dec 1990, p.76]","60","99674"
"8346","From a technical standpoint, Taking Lives is competent and sometimes even impressive. It is cleanly edited and nicely shot -- at times as cool and rich as a York Peppermint Pattie. Beyond that, there is not much to say.","60","364045"
"8347","There are a few moments when Richard Attenborough as the chief engineer of the whole project demonstrates some impressive strength and poise. But for much longer than is artful or essential, The Great Escape grinds out its tormenting story without a peek beneath the surface of any man, without a real sense of human involvement. It's a strictly mechanical adventure with make-believe men.","60","57115"
"8348","It's a pretty compelling yarn, not to mention full of pretty pictures, and yet it could be so much more than that.","60","240510"
"8349","Unfortunately, a new problem rears its head: It seems no young audience member can be trusted to enjoy a thoughtful story without a heroic, borderline-obnoxious surrogate (here, he's voiced by Zac Efron) zooming around on a scooter, bonking villainous heads and saving the day.","60","1482459"
"8350","Picture the dopes from ""Dumb and Dumber"" getting mixed up in organized crime -- but without benefit of Jim Carrey's rubberized pratfalls or his go-to-hell anarchism.","60","227005"
"8351","The Nice Guys harks back to the 70s golden age of revisionist detective thrillers, but the result feels too knowingly déja vu, rather than bringing a truly fresh angle.","60","3799694"
"8352","Haneke's superb cast provide beautifully measured hints at the disconnect between the ribbon's symbolism and the entire town's unspoken atrocities.","60","1149362"
"8353","By the end, were it not for Murray, watching Rushmore would be like reading an article on ""Why adolescents need Prozac.""","60","128445"
"8354","A witty and sometimes surreal sci-fi comedy, Men in Black is a wild knuckleball of a movie that keeps dancing in and out of the strike zone.","60","119654"
"8355","Unfailingly energetic, 10 Things is like a puppy that can't stop wagging its tail, begging for attention...Even more than ""Cruel Intentions,"" this movie plays like an awkward high-school production of a classic.","60","147800"
"8356","A fairly serious psychodrama rendered in cartoon images.","60","166276"
"8357","The problem, as always, is that when you try to mix cliches with more complicated data it's often the cliches that win out.","60","133952"
"8358","The funny lines fall flat and the relationships and conversations among adult characters are straight out of 1950s sitcoms. Now that's scary.","60","198781"
"8359","Hellboy might not have the name-recognition factor of the Spider- or Batmen, but Guillermo del Toro brings the audience swiftly up to speed on artist-writer Mike Mignola's comic book anti-hero.","60","167190"
"8360","As derivative interplanetary clunkers go, Flash Gordon is good for a few laughs -- some of them intentional. [05 Dec 1980, p.F1]","60","80745"
"8361","The closest sensory approximation of an acid trip ever achieved by a mainstream movie and the latest example of Mr. Gilliam's visual bravura.","60","120669"
"8362","Why, then, do we not feel bullied by the result? Partly because the camera, as I say, tells a subtler tale than the dialogue does, and lures us into a grudging respect for the bravado of Muse and his men; but mainly because of Tom Hanks. This most likable of actors deliberately presents us with a character who makes no effort to be liked.","60","1535109"
"8363","Both in name and spirit, The A-Team drags the Eighties into the 21st century, and you might be surprised to find -- if only briefly -- that you've missed them just a little.","60","429493"
"8364","This second installment is heavy on battle sequences, which will thrill some viewers more than others.","60","167261"
"8365","Promised Land presents its environmental concerns in a clear, upfront manner but hits some narrative and character bumps in the second half that weaken the impact of this fundamentally gentle, sympathetic work.","60","2091473"
"8366","A lean, atmospheric and acutely creepy little horror pic - nothing more, nothing less.","60","391198"
"8367","While these ninnies' antics and banter are remarkably entertaining, the quality of the satire depends on when the movie is sending up ludicrous extremist logic and when it's just engaging in repetitive buffoonery.","60","1341167"
"8368","Director Spike Jonze's sharp instincts and vibrant visual style can't quite compensate for the lack of narrative eventfulness that increasingly bogs down this bright-minded picture.","60","386117"
"8369","A beautiful, exotic and well-acted cultural hybrid, but it’s never as moving as it ought to be.","60","397535"
"8370","An accomplished film that carries with it the unshakable feeling that we've seen it all before.","60","112641"
"8371","While slickly enjoyable in parts, the biggest misstep here comes by puncturing Spielberg’s grandeur.","60","369610"
"8372","In this film [Hughes] has created a character who is every teen-ager's fantasy, but in the process he has lost some of the authenticity of his other films - leaving several slow transitions or awkward moments.","60","91042"
"8373","In an era where monster mythology has become raw material for all sorts of mediocrity, Priest is one of the best examples of a broad-scale vampire blockbuster.","60","822847"
"8374","Somewhat entertaining, in its own little mud-brown way.","60","1037705"
"8375","As a moral reconsideration of the role of violence in previous Eastwood films, this is strong and sure, and characters who play against genre expectations give the film a provocative aftertaste. The only limitation, really, is that the picture hasn't much dramatic urgency apart from its revisionist context.","60","105695"
"8376","Lethal Weapon is vulgar, violent and predictable. Yet, in some outbreak of id, I got caught up in the shenanigans of Danny Glover and Mel Gibson as a mismatched cop team. Mr. Glover is more than solid and Mr. Gibson has added a kind of raw humor to his repertoire that is extremely sexy. [5 Mar 1987, p.1]","60","93409"
"8377","Sarandon offers a lovely performance as the brash but starkly vulnerable Love, while Jones delivers a slickly entertaining portrait of a legal eagle who's more like a vulture. [22 July 1994, p.L28]","60","109446"
"8378","Director Bob Clark teamed with nostalgic humorist Jean Shepherd for this squeaky clean and often quite funny 1983 yuletide comedy, adapted from Shepherd's novel In God We Trust: All Others Pay Cash.","60","85334"
"8379","It's unfortunate a picture as lovingly envisioned and beautifully rendered as Hope and Glory has to struggle to find a resolution. [25 Dec 1987, p.7]","60","93209"
"8380","There’s an ironic detachment that permeates the dark fairy-tale atmosphere, and the performances are pitched to that heightened David Lynch-like caricature.","60","97493"
"8381","Given the way the film consistently relies on the talented actor's left-of-center charms, you end up with a cake-and-eat-it-too critique: You get to acknowledge how one-dimensional the male fantasies of hot nerd-messiah chicks are while basking in exactly the same thing. Nice try.","60","1839492"
"8382","Mulan, like all the characters in this movie, is a cookie-cutter American prototype, lazily ripped off from the Disney boilerplate that fashioned Pocahontas et al.","60","120762"
"8383","Over-indulgent and melodramatic, as is the nature of artistic mythmaking, The Golden Age will beguile and repel in equal measure. The performances are supreme, although some viewers may struggle to reconcile the director’s epic intentions.","60","414055"
"8384","Kidman accomplishes a remarkable feat of transformation, adopting not only an accent, but a slightly seedy, faintly feral demeanor that almost makes you forget her icy good looks and fashion model's figure.","60","188453"
"8385","Severe and unflinching, The Whistleblower relies on journalistic realism to pack its punch.","60","896872"
"8386","Most big-screen adaptations of small-screen fare seek to discover some deeper - or, at least, more complex - implications of the material. But in this new Fugitive, the filmmakers have taken just the opposite approach.","60","106977"
"8387","It sets out to be less pompous than similar films, which inevitably means it feels less substantial. While amusing rather than hilarious, it ought to establish Matt Damon as a star character actor.","60","1130080"
"8388","Like its slack-jawed clones, The Island is full of energy and incredibly pretty but burdened with only the minimum of smarts.","60","399201"
"8389","The premise is fascinating. The idea of billions of bird-brains refusing to eat crow any longer and adopting the hunt-and-peck system, with homo sapiens as their ornithological target, is fraught with potential. Cinematically, Hitchcock & Co have done a masterful job of meeting this formidable challenge. But dramatically, The Birds is little more than a shocker-for shock’s-sake.","60","56869"
"8390","The film also comes across like a rough cut that was never looked at as a coherent whole, and some segments that start off as promising become interminable while others feel entirely unnecessary. There's no pressure on or expectation for Tarantino to please anyone other than himself, and the film feels overstuffed with ideas that should have been pruned.","60","1853728"
"8391","For about an hour the writing, acting and direction coalesce in a prismatic, hyperkinetic ode to end-of-century doom. And then the two-hours-plus film starts to subside into genre convention. [16 Oct 1995, p.86]","60","114558"
"8392","While the political grit behind the saga is somewhat sidelined, this is a fun watch enhanced by its stellar British cast.","60","1371155"
"8393","Krasinki’s film remains resolutely resistant to surprise in style or story terms.","60","3714720"
"8394","The whole lighter-than-air lark whizzes by like a brisk, kandy-kolored dream of the 1960s, flavored by a Saul Bass inspired credit sequence; a slinky, Henry Mancini-esque score; and a stunning array of period sets and evocative locales.","60","264464"
"8395","The trouble is that the movie in which Poppy does, in fact, exist never quite rises to her level.","60","1045670"
"8396","It's strange to call a film with so much nudity and simulated sex ""old-fashioned,"" but The Sessions nicely bridges that gulf.","60","1866249"
"8397","With a more accomplished script and an actor of rather more technical prowess than Reeves (nabbing the Prince Hal role), this may just have worked. Here, it is just squirmingly embarrassing stuff.","60","102494"
"8398","Female-empowerment fantasy or just plain prurience, ""Grave"" is extremely efficient grindhouse. If there is any message here at all, it's don't mess with a novelist: being creative is her job.","60","1242432"
"8399","It's all very impressive without being particularly enthralling.","60","209163"
"8400","Den of Thieves is better at set-up than follow-through. The movie is clever enough, until it cheats. It tries to fill in its characters, until reducing them to plot devices.","60","1259528"
"8401","This is stupid but it’s also mostly entertaining, thanks to Johnson and a plot that moves fast enough to retain our attention yet without enough, ahem, the originality to ensure it lingers in our minds once the fire has been extinguished.","60","5758778"
"8402","Though a definite improvement on the last three abortive Star Wars prequels directed by series creator George Lucas, The Force Awakens is only at its best in fits and starts, its success dependent on who of its mix of franchise veterans and first-timers is on the screen.","60","2488496"
"8403","The scares are mostly very scary indeed, and that means the film does its job.","60","2226417"
"8404","An unparalleled technical achievement... Yet the story amounts to little more than inspired silliness about the filmmaking biz where cartoon characters face off against cartoonish humans.","60","96438"
"8405","Like many movies with wimpy intellectual infrastructures, St. Elmo's Fire is not without a certain trumpery charm. [1 June 1995, p.55]","60","90060"
"8406","For all its mosaic of nice details, Silverado is still a faintly hollow creation-constructed, not torn from the heart. For a generation of kids to whom the Western is a new adventure, there probably will be action and distraction enough to dazzle. Those who need to be deeply stirred by this redoubtable form will still have to wait: Silverado is good but not great. [10 Jul 1985, p.1]","60","90022"
"8407","But the film's central figure remains a cipher, the subject of a colorful scrapbook rather than a revealing portrait.","60","115632"
"8408","Chase presides amiably over this uneven but affable slapstick comedy.","60","97958"
"8409","The kind of grim, character-based movie that needs a strong performer to anchor it. Director Derek Cianfrance has been fortunate enough to land two: Michelle Williams and Ryan Gosling.","60","1120985"
"8410","McDonagh indulges in too many '90s affectations, from blaring chapter titles to philosophizing gangsters. But he captures his misty setting's insular atmosphere beautifully.","60","1540133"
"8411","Churchill’s resolve, like the bravery of the soldiers, airmen and ordinary Britons in “Dunkirk,” is offered not as a rebuke to the current generation, but rather as a sop, an easy and complacent fantasy of Imperial gumption and national unity.","60","4555426"
"8412","The surprising thing here is how smoothly this over-iced cake goes down.","60","817230"
"8413","Gere does his best to give Arbitrage an agitated energy, but Jarecki's fatalism works against the film.","60","1764183"
"8414","The second movie by ""Being John Malkovich"" writer Charlie Kaufman is even weirder than his first.","60","219822"
"8415","Written and directed in a campy, tongue-in-cheek style, it's a loving homage to those wild imports from Hong Kong--kung-fu movies.","60","90728"
"8416","A tropical sex comedy that’s a little unfocused, but Segal and co throw plenty of funniness at the wall - and most of it sticks.","60","800039"
"8417","As world-creation YA pictures go, The Maze Runner feels refreshingly low-tech and properly story-driven.","60","1790864"
"8418","At its best, State and Main is fast and sharp, but when a movie like this goes off the rails, it's more disappointing than when a bad movie does.","60","120202"
"8419","Lacks the raw power of the original but offers its own brand of exploitative fun.","60","351977"
"8420","The characters are never really more than stereotypes (the brain, the beauty, the dreamer, the jock), but as the body count begins to mount, you feel their terror build.","60","119345"
"8421","There's a hint of comforting, chocolate-box, Sunday-night TV here, but it's delivered via such quietly powerful performances and with such hope that it's hard to resist.","60","5716464"
"8422","As lurching, awkward, and dirty-minded as the three horny man-boys at its center--but not, in the end, quite as funny or endearing.","60","829482"
"8423","In the post-Columbine age, far too many cops' partners have gone un-murdered. And too many unsuspecting daughters have freely traveled abroad, unmolested by foreign fiends. Leave it to the French to give Americans what we didn't realize we were missing.","60","936501"
"8424","The latest Star Trek flick, Insurrection, is the 9th, and although it doesn't suck as completely as some ignoble odd-numbered low points, it doesn't exactly boldly go where no one has gone before.","60","120844"
"8425","A standard, gadget-crazed exercise in whiz-bang adventure with its tongue lodged deep inside its cheek.","60","167456"
"8426","It falters once the actual war begins: Ben Kingsley shows up as a Maori warrior with the weirdest imaginable accent, the final battle is uninvolving, and there’s an unconvincing upbeat coda. Ender’s Game ends up being fitfully engaging and endearingly odd.","60","1731141"
"8427","Mills pulls off the nonchronological structure with uncommon sensitivity; unfortunately, he also confuses sensitivity with preciousness (recurring scenes show the hero confiding in a Jack Russell terrier).","60","1532503"
"8428","Any movie in which the longtime FBI honcho features as the central character must supply some insight into what made him tick, or suffer from the reality that the Bureau's exploits were far more interesting than the bureaucrat who ran it -- a dilemma J. Edgar never rises above.","60","1616195"
"8429","Stone is highly charged and vibrant, and pits Edward Norton against Robert De Niro for two utterly electrifying performances.","60","1423995"
"8430","The result is a bit like a weightless swirl of cotton candy with a mere second of sweetness before it dissolves on your tongue. But then there's nothing wrong with cotton candy, and besides, the filmmakers never promised more. I guess they're just not into that.","60","1001508"
"8431","With suitable suspension of disbelief this makes for agreeable enough nonsense.","60","115963"
"8432","In ingenuity and charm, this DreamWorks offering isn't up there with ""Kung Fu Panda,"" which remains the sharpest, fullest film from the studio. You may get the feeling that Megamind was made for, and possibly by, really smart six-year-olds. Nothing wrong with that; audiences of all ages can be tickled by the higher form of preadolescent humor.","60","1001526"
"8433","Don Cheadle flails about trying to channel the spirit of late jazz-trumpeting legend Miles Davis in Miles Ahead, a biopic that rejects typical genre conventions to the point of chasing itself down lame, tangential paths.","60","790770"
"8434","Has its rollicking moments and snappy lines but even Pacino can't elevate them into more than a fleetingly juicy treat. This is a movie that desperately wishes it had been written by David Mamet.","60","417217"
"8435","Younger children getting in on the ground floor of fantasy will enjoy the film.","60","363771"
"8436","There isn't a lucid moment in it (and much of the dialogue is rendered unintelligible by Russell's subversive direction), but it has dash, style, and good looks, as well as the funniest curtain line since Some Like It Hot.","60","80360"
"8437","The sheer insanity of the premise alone is enough to make Tusk a surreal hoot.","60","3099498"
"8438","It would be easy to dismiss as 100 percent ersatz if it didn't rekindle at least some of the old excitement - and if the magic of Spielberg's older movies didn't filter through, like light from a distant galaxy.","60","1650062"
"8439","A deeply silly movie, but it is sumptuous to look at, and it never stands still. Its creators, Don Bluth and Gary Goldman, have given the story a lilting rhythm and glittering surface of the most extravagant jewel-encrusted fairy tale.","60","118617"
"8440","The material hasn't been paced for the screen; there are dead spots (without even background music), but there are also a lot of funny verbal routines and a musical burlesque of Carmen, and Harpo, as a fiendish pickpocket, is much faster (and less aesthetic and self-conscious and innocent) than in the Brothers' later comedies.","60","19777"
"8441","Saving Mr Banks is an indulgent, overlong picture which is always on the verge of becoming a mess. Thankfully, reliable old Tom Hanks snaps his fingers and – spit, spot – everything more or less gets cleared away.","60","2140373"
"8442","There’s a lot of great filmmaking in Novitiate, but there’s also quite a bit still missing.","60","4513316"
"8443","Caine and Duvall paired on screen would be worth the price of admission even if they were just reading the Yellow Pages.","60","327137"
"8444","An intelligent, engagingly honest study of love lost and, just maybe, regained.","60","381681"
"8445","An average movie improved by Cruise's star appeal and accomplished supporting cast.","60","106918"
"8446","What does it say that we have a closer relationship with the car than with the characters? It says Bruckheimer.","60","187078"
"8447","Yippee-ki-yay! Willis still has the goods.","60","337978"
"8448","What director Knight excels at is continually inventive framing and composition, at suggesting, through layers of window and reflected traffic, the mental state of Locke, the hero.","60","2692904"
"8449","Griffith's talent, energy, and sexiness give it some drive and punch.","60","96463"
"8450","Obvious, though, is the word for Hopper's direction. It amplifies to rock-concert level every pained plosive in Bertie's speech, forces certain characters dangerously close to caricature.","60","1504320"
"8451","Just fast, frenetic and funny enough to amuse both new fans and longtime devotees of the characters who have inspired more than 30 years worth of animated TV episodes and made-for-video features.","60","267913"
"8452","It’s an adventure which begins by being bizarre and hilarious but appears to run out of ideas at its mid-way point, and run out of interest in what had at first seemed to be its central comic image: humans turning into animals.","60","3464902"
"8453","This material is charged enough without piling on the melodrama and the lip-smacking violence. The movie too often sacrifices reportage for razzle-dazzle.","60","120586"
"8454","Kloves doesn't want to play by conventional romantic comedy rules, but he hasn't quite figured out what to replace them with. After the first seductive hour, which dances on the edge of comedy and melancholy, The Fabulous Baker Boys grows increasingly frustrating. The audience is enjoying Klove's hip, knowing update of romantic conventions, but the director seems to think he's making ""realism"": he misjudges the gravity of his story, and his touch becomes more ponderous. [23 Oct 1983, p.84]","60","97322"
"8455","Once it's high-concept plot kicks in, Gervais' hilariously self-deprecating persona is really all that keeps it grounded.","60","1058017"
"8456","It's a textbook example of a well-crafted movie, beautifully shot, impeccably acted, and structured like an elegant three-act play. So why does the movie feel as pleasantly deadening as the midcentury Connecticut suburb where it takes place?","60","959337"
"8457","Miss Farrow is quite marvelous, pale, suffering, almost constantly on-screen in a difficult role that requires her to be learning for almost two hours what the audience has guessed from the start...Everyone else is fine, but the movie—although it is pleasant—doesn't quite work on any of its dark or powerful terms.","60","63522"
"8458","For fans, counting up how many superheroes can emerge from the clown car of one three-hour movie is half the fun. For casual moviegoers — say, those who might skip minor installments such as “Ant-Man and the Wasp” — it accounts for half the exhaustion, a bit of world-building fatigue to go along with the sensory overload of a fantasy realm that seems stuck in perpetual apocalypse.","60","4154796"
"8459","Even after it becomes clearer which side of law Harris is operating on, the film continues to work as a taut -- if violent -- police thriller.","60","139654"
"8460","Not a fiasco, a disaster or a scandal. But not as funny as it should have been, and not the trenchant office satire one was led to expect. As a comedy built on the juicy soil of revenge, ""9 to 5"" falls between two poles. It's not wild or dark enough to qualify as a truly disturbing farce and it's too fanciful and silly to succeed as realistic satire. Politically and esthetically, it's harmless--a mildly amusing romp that tends to get swallowed up by its own overly intricate plot. [22 Dec 1980, p.72]","60","80319"
"8461","Overall it's what it aspires to be--a pleasant time-waster.","60","177789"
"8462","Coppola’s attitude toward her subject seems equivocal, uncertain; there is perhaps a smidgen of social commentary, but she seems far too at home in the world she depicts to offer a rewarding critique of it.","60","2132285"
"8463","Despite a late-inning swoon of pat emotional generosity, Game Six is a gratifying playground of high-wire language.","60","425055"
"8464","Sure, Dumb and Dumberer is dumb, dumber and dumberer than the original, but if you like that kind of banal, rustic and sophomoric humor (and I have to admit, I kinda do), it might be worth a buck or two at a discount theater.","60","329028"
"8465","This stripped-down chiller has some decent jump-frights, but a dearth of memorable moments.","60","452702"
"8466","Movies are the lesser medium for Fey and Carell. They’re the stars of two relatively sophisticated, media-savvy network sitcoms, yet their big-screen comedies are retro.","60","1279935"
"8467","Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian is what my mother would have called a kakabarly--a large, foaming broth into which she emptied the forlorn and highly miscellaneous contents of her icebox.","60","1078912"
"8468","This is an unashamedly old-fashioned children's movie, and a predictable message is part of the mission. But that's okay; what the movie lacks in surprises, it makes up for in whimsical fun.","60","441773"
"8469","It reeks of unearned profundity, but I found it entertaining.","60","259711"
"8470","Escape From L.A. is a mild letdown. It repeats the basic plot of the original, with a lighter tone, cheaper-looking (yet actually more expensive) special effects, and a grunge soundtrack.","60","116225"
"8471","A corny, old-fashioned backstage farce.","60","138097"
"8472","Booksmart has its undeniably crowd-pleasing moments, but it doesn’t stray as far from the status quo of the genre as it possibly could have.","60","1489887"
"8473","The writer-director appears to be straining for his effects. Some sequences, especially one involving bondage harnesses and homosexual rape, have the uncomfortable feeling of creative desperation, of someone who's afraid of losing his reputation scrambling for any way to offend sensibilities. [14 Oct 1994]","60","110912"
"8474","Ultimately, though, the movie never transcends the limitations of its Hemingwayesque, men-with-men attitudes.","60","113277"
"8475","Flawed but undeniably provocative and brilliantly acted by Gosling.","60","247199"
"8476","The movie is part eerie Southern gothic and part Hollywood self-congratulation for its enlightened racial attitudes.","60","56592"
"8477","The chassis may be slick and speedy, but under the hood Focus lives up to its Ford-produced namesake: sturdy but not exactly stimulating.","60","2381941"
"8478","By deviating from Stoker's text, Hammer was clearly signalling a new direction in horror. It was garish, it was sexy and it was never afraid to be gory.","60","51554"
"8479","Although featuring some good acting, and certainly ambitious in its critique of the characters, American Animals is too sleepy to strike a chord.","60","6212478"
"8480","A cobwebbed, mummified horror entry that makes obvious, cartoonishly grotesque demands for attention.","60","251736"
"8481","The script is sharp and funny, the direction sure-footed on both the comedy and action fronts, and the whole thing adds up to rather more concerted fun than Indiana Jones' flab-ridden escapade in the Temple of Doom.","60","88011"
"8482","That humor, like the film's moments of drama, tends to be measured rather than over the top -- but on the whole that's a good thing. It suggests a filmmaker who knows the value of restraint, which is a rarity, particular in a first-timer.","60","4925292"
"8483","Sheen thrives in the guise of the idiosyncratic Clough in a brilliantly candid, if bitty, football parable.","60","1226271"
"8484","More a remake than a sequel, this production seems like a pointless effort. With a plot virtually identical to that of the first film, the only real difference between the two--and it is significant--is that Spielberg didn't direct this one.","60","77766"
"8485","Maybe you'll enjoy it, but don't expect to remember it ten minutes later, or even to believe in the characters while you're watching them.","60","109831"
"8486","Madsen is a much better actress than is usually found in such a role. However, if you don't like splashes of blood or bees swarming out of bodies, you may want to think twice about this one.","60","103919"
"8487","Once I Think We’re Alone Now establishes that Grace and Del represent love versus stability, the film doesn’t have a convincing way to reconcile the two.","60","6169694"
"8488","Gere’s commitment to the role almost makes up for the film’s flaws.","60","4191702"
"8489","Disney-style kitsch. It's technologically sophisticated, but with just about all the simpering old Disney values in place.","60","97757"
"8490","There's no getting away from it, Gibson has produced another bombastic, crowd-pleasing and obviously blood-soaked movie which expertly glorifies that which its hero was against.","60","2119532"
"8491","Loyal fans of the Sondheim original may feel a bit let down themselves. There’s much to love here. But working with original “Woods” writer and Sondheim collaborator James Lapine, Marshall tones down the crucial dark shading in some places and has trouble with pacing in others.","60","2180411"
"8492","While not significantly better or worse than the predecessor, a rather astounding object of devotion for a movie studio--an enormously expensive recreation of a moribund TV series--this sequel is perfectly presentable and harmless, a klunker as comfortable as your easy chair. [4 June 1982, p.D1]","60","84726"
"8493","Granted, it takes a while to get to that point. Nearly an hour, in fact. That's owed to Zvyagintsev's penchant for long, lingering shots, which emphasizes mood over kinetic energy, and which also at times creates a drag on the narrative. That mood, however -- tragic, hopeless, heartbreaking -- is expertly created.","60","6304162"
"8494","The horror fan who climbs into his movie seat looking for an experience as intense as a roller-coaster ride will be more teased than satisfied. The director of ""Lolita,"" ""Dr. Strangelove"" and ""Clockwork Orange"" is simply working with less interesting material: The Shining is a slender, barely believable tale being asked to carry a lot of style and weight. [13 June 1980, p.19]","60","81505"
"8495","Part metaphorical (which it jokes about halfway through), part homage to old Hollywood, part whodunit, and part social commentary on an America reeling from mid-century chaos, it’s overstuffed but still feels controlled.","60","6628394"
"8496","The suspense and technical wizardry are the only reason to watch Jurassic Park. In a summer movie, that's more than enough, of course. But screenwriter Michael Crichton, adapting his popular novel with David Koepp, slashes almost everything that made the book an entertaining read.","60","107290"
"8497","It is ultimately more routine than provocative, despite the timeliness and seriousness of the issues it raises.","60","218817"
"8498","Technically ambitious, dramatically basic. Still, it's a major step up from an AvP sequel and delivers all the Saturday night whizz-bang and Sunday morning brain-ripping you could want.","60","1564585"
"8499","It’s only when Pugh gets her hands on spoiled younger sister Amy and opens up that often-overlooked strand of the work does the film seem to find relevance beyond its pretty fussiness and that warm, wintery – decidedly Christmassy, somewhat pleased-with-itself – glow.","60","3281548"
"8500","Well shot, well edited, well paced, Deepstar Six seems to have gone to the idea-well just a bit too often -- or is that not often enough? While the creature is an average creation, the underwater visual effects are often quite good, if not plentiful enough. [14 Jan 1989]","60","97179"
"8501","Mr. Luhrmann's frenetic hodgepodge actually amounts to a witty and sometimes successful experiment, an attempt to reinvent ""Romeo and Juliet"" in the hyperkinetic vocabulary of post-modern kitsch. This is headache Shakespeare, but there's method to its madness.","60","117509"
"8502","Unlike ""The Matrix,"" all fights and stunts -- including a 14-minute freeway chase -- have a disturbing tendency to repeat intricately choreographed action. Thus, computer technology and overkill supplant the ingenuity of the original film's action.","60","234215"
"8503","That script – co-written by Terry Hayes and director Brian Helgeland – is almost too noir for its own good at times, but Gibson somehow manages to pull its implausibility off.","60","120784"
"8504","It ain’t pretty, but it gets the action fans off.","60","99739"
"8505","Mr. Lyne is able to make things look the way they're supposed to look because he trained in the television-commercial world. But he has a hard time getting beneath the gloss. [17 Sep 1987, p.1]","60","93010"
"8506","It is blunt, simple and sentimental, using time-tested methods to teach a clear and rousing lesson.","60","453562"
"8507","If you buy in to the central romance, you’ll laugh, you’ll cry, you’ll swoon. Otherwise, the lingering glances, lip-chewing and regular de-shirting may cause uncontrollable giggles.","60","1259571"
"8508","Of the Naked Gun films, 33 1/3 is the most successful in capturing the breakneck genre parody that marked the short-lived but critically acclaimed Police Squad TV series (which won Nielsen his only Emmy). Taking broad pot shots at everything from Thelma & Louise to The Crying Game, and culminating with a breathless swipe at the sacred cow of the movie industry, the Academy Awards.","60","110622"
"8509","The script is ridiculous, the bodies are great and the film skates so long on the line between knowingly bad and bad that by the time the body count hits 100 and the booby count hits 1000, we've lost track of the difference.","60","464154"
"8510","Scary moments are scattered throughout the teleplays by Billy Brown and Dan Angel, with a few jittery jolts to grab attention (particularly during the first episode), but the writing and stories are pedestrian.","60","106449"
"8511","I can't say I warmed to the results, but I was solidly held for the film's two hours.","60","134273"
"8512","Though high-minded and well-intentioned – as well as being conceived on an epic scale – there’s something faintly stodgy and safety-first about the endeavour.","60","1809398"
"8513","Ultimately, Jedi even backs off some of the more tantalizing possibilities suggested by the cliffhanging scenario of ""Empire."" This inhibition appears to grow out of consideration for the feelings of the juvenile audience, which can enjoy an abundance of thrills and close calls while resting assured that nothing catastrophic is going to be fall the heroes.","60","86190"
"8514","Far more often than not, Lee's talented ensemble -- who really do look like they're having a blast together -- generate more laugh-out-loud moments than lulls, all of which help make Girls Trip work nicely as a mood-elevating mid-summer diversion.","60","3564472"
"8515","There are better special effects than last time, and Bella gets to be brave when it counts. All of which should be like a freshly opened vein for fans -- especially as it results in Eclipse ending up almost exactly where it started, with weddings still to come. Can you wait?","60","1325004"
"8516","Despite a first reel entirely devoted to establishing characters, Cloverfield is basically a line-'em-up, pick-'em-off horror movie that's effective without being either viscerally frightening or emotionally moving. Watching it is like going through a car wash: You come out of it thoroughly Cloverfield-ized, but essentially unchanged.","60","1060277"
"8517","As storytelling, it’s pristine: it moves like a reptile playing the long game. But its cruelty is tough to bear.","60","5715874"
"8518","The raunchy premise here is just a smokescreen for the sort of squarely moralistic, altar-bound comedy of which even Jane Austen would approve.","60","1632708"
"8519","Actually funnier than the first movie, but getting to those parts requires a little bit of patient mental fast-forwarding.","60","145660"
"8520","Slick, well acted and engaging. It's also morally bankrupt--a film that makes you feel as though you've been taken for a smooth ride by the Hollywood machine and dropped somewhere very nasty.","60","1458175"
"8521","A businessman is visited by an otherworldly presence who has the nerve to fall in love with his daughter in this savory, extralong feature, whose obvious plotlines unfold with an almost painful slowness that somehow makes them deeper.","60","119643"
"8522","You never forget that you're watching a talented living actress laboring to mimic a long-gone movie star who - on-screen, at least - never seemed to be acting at all.","60","1655420"
"8523","While falling short of its comedy promise (except when Richard Pryor is on the screen), Silver Streak is an okay adventure comedy starring Gene Wilder on the lam from crooked art thieves aboard a trans-continental train.","60","75223"
"8524","Although the second half of the picture (which could have been called Single White Females Can't Live Together) is mostly a waste, the early scenes are tantalizing enough to be worth a look. [14 Aug 1992, p.17]","60","105414"
"8525","There needn’t be some deeper theme or intent behind a movie like this, but The Lighthouse is an awfully trying experience to end with such a sneering shrug of the shoulders. I couldn’t shake the feeling that The Lighthouse is simply an exercise, an overeager writing class project from a guy who’s just read Sartre, Beckett, and, I dunno, Stephen King.","60","7984734"
"8526","Cavill and Hammer have each toplined major tentpoles before, so it’s something of a mystery why neither makes much of an impression here, but there’s a curious vacuum at the center of The Man From U.N.C.L.E. that almost certainly owes to its casting.","60","1638355"
"8527","This one coasts by on Hanks' immense appeal and charm, but more focus and a touch more sharpness are needed to make it really come alive.","60","1583420"
"8528","The movie feels oddly undercooked and aimless.","60","217869"
"8529","The notable lack of chemistry between Cruz and Homar is a crucial absence in a film about all-consuming romance. And though each part is great fun to watch, the whole feels unfinished.","60","913425"
"8530","If anything, watching the film is like attending an old-style Southern tent revival - you want to believe in the fight against all that fire and brimstone. Heck, you want to join the righteous brigade. But when the lights go up and the fever dies down, it feels more like you've witnessed a show than a real showdown with the devil.","60","1586752"
"8531","The Wright/Stoppard Anna Karenina is not a total success, but it's a bold and creative response to the novel.","60","1781769"
"8532","Mortensen shines but a contrived, issue-driven plot destabilises what could have been a great Russian gangster movie.","60","765443"
"8533","Has the inherent limits of all movies that feed on movies, rather than life -- it's original, yet it's not.","60","393109"
"8534","An elegant, entertaining, informative picture with a gallery of vivid supporting turns, this provisionally crowns the winning Blunt as a Brit-pic star - but it skimps a bit on the bodice-ripping, blood and thunder.","60","962736"
"8535","The film is so understated with regard to Loung’s basic predicament that we don’t recognize her driving desire...until the movie is over.","60","4882376"
"8536","With the exception of a brief sequence on the Galapagos Islands, where Maturin briefly indulges in some pre-Darwinian study of its unique ecosystem, the entire film takes place aboard the ship, and Weir's greatest accomplishment may be that it never feels claustrophobic.","60","311113"
"8537","It's just as juvenile as you'd expect, and even funnier.","60","115641"
"8538","Mr. Gleeson, Mr. Farrell and especially the late-arriving and welcome Mr. Fiennes have great fun rummaging around inside Mr. McDonagh’s modest bag of tricks.","60","780536"
"8539","Julia Roberts glitters like gold dust, and she is ideally partnered with Rupert Everett, who gives a witty, wicked, bust-out performance.","60","119738"
"8540","This is an Aquaman film that needs lots more Aquaman and vastly less bombast. It’s visually wild and recklessly inventive, but the cast deserve better than to be cast adrift in a tempest of CGI.","60","1477834"
"8541","It might seem unlikely that something so narratively simplistic and ultimately childish could sustain its runtime but the chaos and comedy of the haphazard gunplay is such that it only suffers from a handful of lulls.","60","4158096"
"8542","More The Wild Geese than The Wild Bunch, The Expendables is not a wasted opportunity, but more one not fully exploited.","60","1320253"
"8543","The efforts to plant this story in a contemporary vernacular are not always successful but the performances are uniformly fine in their adherence to the material, and consistently avoid any vulgarity or showboating.","60","95497"
"8544","What little dimension Maudie offers is a direct result of Hawkins’ contributions, which draw from her character’s past to add texture to her performance.","60","3721954"
"8545","Though it can't bear too much comparison with Sicario, Wind River is far better than its title suggests and a promising directorial debut.","60","5362988"
"8546","Chandor handles the action scenes smoothly, making it easy to gloss over what the movie is saying, trying to say or accidentally saying. He maintains the kind of accelerated pace that gives your eyes a workout, and pads the story with an inviting camaraderie that brings you into the group.","60","1488606"
"8547","Despite being recognised as one of the better 007 films (and one laudably devoid of what would later become the formulaic Bond ending), number two in the series actually proves marginally less memorable than many of the others.","60","57076"
"8548","The film’s Groundhog Day-meets-Independence Day plot is actually pretty genius.","60","1631867"
"8549","It is frustrating to see this much raw talent on the screen, not to mention behind the camera, and to have had these people produce something that hints at so many complex things, but ultimately fails to deliver on them. It’s just a comedy, then. So be it, Jedi.","60","1234548"
"8550","It’s a true endurance test, far too grim to be considered exciting, but not really informative enough to enlighten us about the effect of our presence in Somalia in 1993.","60","265086"
"8551","Outrageously Oscar-seeking performances like actor Huston's, coupled with director Huston's comparative conviction with action sequences, work against any yearning for significance. There's a quite enjoyable yarn buried under the hollow laughter.","60","40897"
"8552","More often, Gatsby feels like a well-rehearsed classic in which the actors say their lines ably, but with no discernible feeling behind them.","60","1343092"
"8553","All this delicious incident has the makings of a gung-ho entertainment – Ian Fleming as mounted by Nasa. Unfortunately that’s not what we get. Even if we were brave enough to try, we would not be capable of spoiling a plot so wilfully obtuse it demands repeat viewings to disentangle.","60","6723592"
"8554","The movie boils down to one character, acting under enormous pressures of space and time, racing to solve a mystery. In this case, that may be good enough.","60","945513"
"8555","Affleck gets the tribalism of Boston's traditionally Irish-American enclaves; it's a defining force in his character's lives. But for all their well-played grit, those characters resolutely remain types, and for all the well-choreographed action, the outcome doesn't matter nearly as much as it should.","60","840361"
"8556","Good as Marriage Story’s pieces are, they’re too finely curated: Baumbach rarely lets the film be as messy as it needs to be, hemming himself in with the threads of his limited perspective.","61","7653254"
"8557","The movie drowns the deeper questions it raises in a sadistic procedural, an endless circular motion of fight scenes whose only justification is themselves.","61","1226753"
"8558","To the end, Okja is as endearing, chaotic and awkward as its title creature. Sometimes, the movie requires the same loving embrace Mija provides for Okja—even though, unlike that portly pig, Okja often lets you down.","61","3967856"
"8559","The Rock retains his uncanny ability to elevate his material. Through sheer will he makes it seem possible that he could shimmy up a fraying rope outside a burning building's glass wall while carrying his own leg.","61","5758778"
"8560","Under the Silver Lake never finds a reason for being as weird as it is, making for a confusing and frustrating experience despite its hypnotic visuals and great score.","62","5691670"
"8561","Based on the best moments of Atomic Blonde, I would very much like to see a series of films in which Charlize Theron’s ruthless, brutal and glamorous secret agent dispatches a variety of Cold War-era enemies to the accompaniment of hit songs from the 80s.","62","2406566"
"8562","On a gutbucket genre-film level, Alien Covenant delivers when it delivers. As with so many of its monster-movie peers, however, there’s just not much to it when the creature isn’t preening for its close-up.","62","2316204"
"8563","Plenty of the tasteless gags don't fly, and for every celebrity cameo that works (a hilariously heavenly Reese Witherspoon), there are two or three that crash and burn.","62","185431"
"8564","Hicks is far less interested in resolving dramatic conflicts than in framing shots.","62","120834"
"8565","David Gordon Green’s Halloween is an intensely frustrating experience, buoyed by solid action and well-crafted scares, but simultaneously damned by an incredibly clunky script and appalling lack of focus.","62","1502407"
"8566","The script glosses over everything that's important to the characters, which makes them vague and poreless. Some sense of specificity, about virtually anything, would be helpful for making them seem less like bare story functions and gag-delivery systems.","62","2702724"
"8567","The loosely autobiographical 8 Mile, an uneven but watchable drama about life in Detroit's slums, begins the shrewd transformation of vitriolic rapper Eminem into a mainstream figure.","63","298203"
"8568","Does John Carter get the job done for the weekend action audience? Yes, I suppose it does. The massive city on legs that stomps across the landscape is well-done. The Tharks are ingenious, although I'm not sure why they need tusks. Lynn Collins makes a terrific heroine.","63","401729"
"8569","A well-made thriller with a lot of good acting, but the death of Elisabeth Campbell is so unnecessarily graphic and gruesome that by the end I felt sort of unclean.","63","144214"
"8570","Thankfully, this time Eastwood flirts (and ogles) but stops just short of going completely over the top. [19 March 1999, Life, p.13E]","63","139668"
"8571","Instead of focusing on FDR as a president, this movie gives up half its length to tawdry soap opera.","63","1477855"
"8572","Is it worth seeing? Yes. The ability to charm in the modern world is rare, and Ishtar does charm. Essentially, it's a teen film for adults, which is to say, it's mindless but not stupid good fun. And there are at least four times when the audience laughs out loud.","63","93278"
"8573","It’s the kind of movie that hammers on your heart even as it’s tripping over its feet, hobbled by unexamined notions of race, ethnicity, and class. Don’t look too closely, and you’ll have a very good time.","63","6966692"
"8574","As a writer and director, Rebecca Miller is at her best when she finds the shared wavelengths of her lead cast's divergent styles.","63","3471098"
"8575","If it weren't for the casting of Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds in the lead roles, the film probably would have gone straight to DVD.","63","1041829"
"8576","Norma Rae is not a bad film, just one that made me angry for what it might have been. Imagine another, more skillful actor, say Dustin Hoffman or Al Pacino, in Leibman's part; then strip away some of the more broadly drawn scenes, and Norma Rae could have been yet another fine film by director Martin Ritt (""Hud,"" ""Sounder,"" and ""Conrack""). [2 March 1979, p.4-12]","63","79638"
"8577","The film goes slack when its screws most need to tighten. Luckily, Smith — flawless in accent and commitment to Omalu's worthy cause — grips you from first to last.","63","3322364"
"8578","Elevated beyond its cutesy contrivances and mawkishness by some extraordinarily good performances.","63","264796"
"8579","When Getty isn’t on-screen, the movie is a bit of a bore and it doesn’t help that Mark Wahlberg is woefully miscast and the thriller elements are anything but tense or suspenseful.","63","5294550"
"8580","Again, as with ""Star Wars,"" the interest lies at least as much in the set design and costumes as the narrative.","63","383574"
"8581","With its immensely likable cast elevating the material, Judge extracts just enough ironic chuckles to rescue the movie from being written off as an assembly-line comedy.","63","1225822"
"8582","Little about Maverick lingers in the mind once the final image has faded from the screen. But it's cleverly crafted, and you can't help enjoying it even when you know it's manipulating you as brazenly as a poker dealer with tricky fingers and a well-stacked deck.","63","110478"
"8583","The origin story is well told, and the characters will not disappoint anyone who values the original comic books. It's in the action scenes that things fall apart.","63","145487"
"8584","A not-bad entry in the Pinhead series Clive Barker started. [29 Oct 2002, p.E1]","63","274546"
"8585","It's a hokey piece of melodrama in a movie that cheats its characters - and its audience - out of some emotional truth.","63","362227"
"8586","There's a great movie out now about magicians, sleight-of-hand maestros, illusionists, card and coin tricksters. Now You See Me is not that movie.","63","1670345"
"8587","Has a bold, inventive style that occasionally compensates for story weaknesses. And, admittedly, there's a certain visceral appeal to the action sequences.","63","118583"
"8588","As dopey as some of the flashbacks to MacLeod's early days are, they feature some spectacular shots of Scotland. It's best to just gawk at the visuals rather than concentrate on the story, however. The plot barely exists. [29 Jan 1995, p.58]","63","110027"
"8589","It's solidly entertaining for what it is and, while it does little to truly rejuvenate the franchise, at least it lessens the pain caused by two gimmicky cross-over pictures that sucked too much juice out of what was one of the 1980s' most surprisingly tense sci-fi action pictures.","63","1424381"
"8590","The more this new Haunting tries to impress with its state-of-the-art techniques, the more it recalls how much Wise accomplished with eerie lighting effects and mysterious noises on the soundtrack. [23 July 1999, p.F1]","63","171363"
"8591","A grade-B rumination on what a nasty guy the devil can be.","63","160484"
"8592","Hanks invokes gravitas, deep introspection and even sly wit as Sullenberger, yet the one thing he can’t make up for is the distinct lack of onscreen danger in what could be considered a decently tame disaster film.","63","3263904"
"8593","Clash of the Titans is a flawed but mildly entertaining regurgitation of Greek mythological elements, but it's also an example of how poorly executed 3D can hamstring a would-be spectacle.","63","800320"
"8594","I like the idea of a cybercrimes agent cracking cases through superior knowledge of the Internet. Marsh could be a great heroine for a continuing series. But Untraceable essentially forces its audience to identify with those who would be willing accomplices to torture and murder. To understate the point, that's not an audience-friendly approach.","63","880578"
"8595","The movie tries its hardest to celebrate the impetuousness of its hero and the exhilaration of his accomplishments. Mostly, though, it just reminds you of the severity of his mistakes.","63","758758"
"8596","Dial your expectations to moderate, burrow in for the duration, and you won't be disappointed - it ain't exactly springtime, but there are worse things than an amiable outing on a winter's night.","63","107048"
"8597","Alternately sweet and mean, sophisticated and vulgar, witty and base, dazzling and ugly, charming and charmless.","63","126029"
"8598","This good movie is buried beneath millions of dollars that were spent on ""production values"" that wreck the show.","63","64115"
"8599","Ultimately, what saves this movie is its sense of humor, not to mention its good humor, which is not the same thing. You find yourself rooting for these characters, although at times you wouldn't mind giving them a little slap up side the head. [18 Feb 1994, p.3F]","63","110950"
"8600","Ultimately, the viewing experience is like watching a snake swallow its own tail -- that once-menacing serpent is now a clown act, all yuks and no venom.","63","120082"
"8601","In ways both large and small, Midway may be the most realistic war movie you’ve ever seen, as those involved in the production of this World War II action film, including Naval historians, have touted it to be. That’s not to say it’s as real as “Saving Private Ryan.”","63","6924650"
"8602","The reason to sit through its uninspired, formulaic moves, however, is its half-dozen spectacular fight sequences.","63","165929"
"8603","Although not bowling me over, Planet 51 is a jolly and good-looking animated feature in glorious 2-D.","63","762125"
"8604","Installment six of the Harry Potter’ series, The Half-Blood Prince, merely gets us one movie closer to the finale, which, apparently is so big (and by big, I mean “$$$$’’) that it’s being split into two parts.","63","417741"
"8605","Not bad for summer jollies, au contraire, but -- ""Holy Raised Bar, Batman!"" -- let's pray that the next installment measures up to the sequel summits of ""Spider-Man 2"" and ""X2.""","63","372784"
"8606","As meaty as this script sounds — every line another morsel — it never allows Wahlberg the chance to make us care what happens to Jim. Do we want him to get what’s coming to him, or are we rooting for him? Either way, Wyatt, Monahan and Wahlberg succeed only in frustrating our will, cashing out with a cop-out finale, making our two hour gamble on The Gambler something less than a sure thing.","63","2039393"
"8607","This spirited enough yarn is sincere and heartening in its belief that our devotion to these youthful myths is healthy for our sense of wonderment.","63","1446192"
"8608","Foster is electrifying as ego and id clash and the movie fires up with genuine provocation.","63","476964"
"8609","The weakness of the film is the weakness of the leading role. That's not a criticism of Mark Wahlberg, who has a quite capable range, but of how he and Russell see the character.","63","964517"
"8610","Deadly serious, straightforward and surprisingly entertaining tragedy.","63","375154"
"8611","Guillermo del Toro doesn't rise above the obligations of staging a film of this sort as a multi-level video game, a stylish but programmatic ride toward an inevitable final boss battle.","63","1663662"
"8612","Seems afraid to cut loose in the manner of Robert Altman or Paul Thomas Anderson, so this labor of love suffers from an overly earnest and morose tone. Which, given the cast in Thirteen Conversations, is a real shame.","63","268690"
"8613","The greater charm of Tin Men is in its affectionate portrayal of small-time hucksters who gloat over classic scams (like cutting seven inches out of the middle of a yardstick so the square footage will be higher). In its own way, the film is a bittersweet drama, a sort of Glengarry Glen Ross without the vitriol.","63","94155"
"8614","The Shape of Water doesn't cohere into the fairy tale promised by the dreamy opening. It makes its points with a jackhammer, wielding symbols in blaring neon.","63","5580390"
"8615","Well acted and crisply directed, this latest version can at least make a claim to competence.","63","139809"
"8616","The whole movie is something of a country-music clich, and it takes all of your imagination to be as enthusiastic about the characters' singing as they are. But The Thing Called Love is worth a look on the big screen. [16 July 1999]","63","108327"
"8617","A perfectly adequate horror romp, but it's hard to imagine anyone remembering it five years from now.","63","418819"
"8618","The characters feel underdeveloped, to the point where it’s sometimes difficult to remain invested in their triumphs and failures.","63","4302938"
"8619","Kidman gets kudos for giving the enterprise a touch of class, while the film gives the studio's library a rare pedigreed addition.","63","230600"
"8620","A new misadventure whose negligibly refined formula somehow ends up being more consistently entertaining.","63","2170439"
"8621","A metaphysical shaggy-dog story, whose unpredictable punchline is its only redeeming feature.","63","167404"
"8622","Novel enough to be worth the price of admission, but you'll think twice before getting back in line for a second visit.","63","2870612"
"8623","David O. Russell proposes that there may be no real barrier between the caustic worldview he wears and the sense of childlike wonder he sells.","63","2446980"
"8624","It's an honorable attempt, but there's still no genuine need for this film to exist.","63","1228987"
"8625","Smoothly directed by Kevin Costner, who also gives a sensitive performance in the leading role. The screenplay is often trite, however, and there's no reason for the picture's three-hour length. [9 Nov 1990, Arts, p.12]","63","99348"
"8626","Clive Barker is not without a sense of humor. And he's certainly not without a sense of what will scare his audiencessenseless. [28 Dec 1988]","63","95294"
"8627","Watching Battle Los Angeles is akin to observing someone else play a video game with top-notch production values. For a while, it's fun, but immersion is born of involvement.","63","1217613"
"8628","Aaliyah rules as the undead Queen of the Damned, even if she has scarcely half an hour of screen time in this campy Anne Rice vampire tale.","63","238546"
"8629","A typically hypnotic, slow-coiling drama from 80-year-old French filmmaker, Jacques Rivette.","63","781435"
"8630","The story is unfocused and the character development is virtually nonexistent.","63","120738"
"8631","We Own the Night can't sustain itself; as the stakes of the story get higher, Gray paints it in broader and broader strokes until there's almost nothing you can believe in it anymore.","63","498399"
"8632","Salt goes down easy, but it's lacking both nourishment and flavor.","63","944835"
"8633","Cars 2 is like a gorgeous sports car with a toxic tailpipe, a busted navigation system and a loud stereo that plays only commercials.","63","1216475"
"8634","Kasdan hasn't lost his touch at gathering terrific ensemble casts, although the performances are uneven.","63","140397"
"8635","Director Alfonso Cuarón has a vision so mesmerizingly terrible that it alone - at least, for those who enjoy a gorgeous nightmare - is reason enough to see the film.","63","206634"
"8636","A fertile example of the Studio Film Gone Berserk, where too many characters and too many story lines geometrically progress until a level of blissful absurdity is reached.","63","780571"
"8637","New York Minute isn't High Art, but it is highly entertaining, especially if you're a member of its target audience.","63","363282"
"8638","A movie that feels a bit like digging a hole in the ground -- an exercise that may build character but doesn't seem to accomplish much else.","63","311289"
"8639","The family dynamic, paired with a few delicious action scenes, is engaging enough that we hardly notice the fillm's major flaw, a rather flimsy and sometimes jingoistic subplot having to do with California's independence.","63","386140"
"8640","Carries an undeniable follow-your-field-of-dreams appeal.","63","265662"
"8641","The patchwork story and pacing robs The Butler of the wit and heart that might have made it a companion piece to the far simpler and more powerful “The Help.” Daniels settles for a soapy, preachy American history version of “Downton Abbey.”","63","1327773"
"8642","Enough conspiracies and secret codes to make Dan Brown sit up and take notice. All this and more can be found in David Robert Mitchell’s bizarre, trippy Under the Silver Lake, where the plot at times seems as perpetually stoned as Andrew Garfield’s lead character.","63","5691670"
"8643","It's got a smattering of hearty laughs and a career-high performance from Sandler.","63","1201167"
"8644","Twohy serves up a hard-to-swallow second-act twist and an unconvincing back story, but the slightly overlong A Perfect Getaway recovers with a pulse-pounding climax.","63","971209"
"8645","The most enjoyable parts of The Secret Life of Walter Mitty are his fantasies, such as one in which he stands up to his boss in a way he never would in real life.","63","359950"
"8646","Turing’s tale needs to be more widely known, and while The Imitation Game may not be a great film, it is an important one.","63","2084970"
"8647","The stand-up routines — from Jackie and the pros alike — are funny and blue enough to shock a few laughs out of you, sometimes in spite of your better judgment, and the star seems once again genuinely invested in creating a character.","63","1967614"
"8648","Inferno is the exact cinematic equivalent of an airport paperback, which is what’s fine and forgettable about it.","63","3062096"
"8649","What completely undermines that appearance is Shankman's chronic inability to shoot the damn scene. His camerawork is so stiff it should be interred in a pine box.","63","427327"
"8650","This is Hollywood's most mature treatment of the '50s-nostalgia theme so far, and the most accurate.","63","83833"
"8651","A movie meant to explode off the screen -- and it's at its best when those explosions are going full blast.","63","213149"
"8652","187 offers some thought-provoking ideas and several effective performances, but the script ultimately lets down both the actors and the audience members who are watching them.","63","118531"
"8653","There's something too slickly contrived and hollow about this film. It's a yuppified wish-fulfillment piece dangling between real world and fairy tale, and it's mostly the actors --especially Lindsay and Elaine Hendrix (as the conniving publicist who is trying to marry Hallie and Annie's dad) -- who manage to bring it off. [29 July 1998]","63","120783"
"8654","Keaton's overamped girlishness, and the adolescent shenanigans she engages in, make a mockery of this overlong romantic comedy's stance as a celebration of mature love.","63","337741"
"8655","There's a familiar feeling to the movie even beyond its twinkle-eyed martial arts melees.","63","120812"
"8656","Fitfully good.","63","497465"
"8657","The Hitcher has a certain weight. It's not junk, and Harmon is neither a hack nor a beginner just taking his genre shot. His movie is arresting in surprising places, and it never really lets us off the hook. There's something here worth seeing, and something about Harmon as well. What will he do next, and can he top this? [27 Feb 1986, p.8]","63","91209"
"8658","The tone of ""Hail, Caesar!"" is even and assured, yet the comic inspiration is sporadic.","63","475290"
"8659","As preposterous wannabe Hitchcockian thrillers go, this one is adequate.","63","1243957"
"8660","The central characters' dogged refusal to cede their places on a team that keeps trying to reject them is a moving display of heroism.","63","4846340"
"8661","His film would benefit from more subtlety and tighter editing, but as both director and star, Gibson takes the story by the hilt and plunges forward, as single-minded as Wallace screaming into battle.","63","112573"
"8662","Chirpy, bland, slightly maudlin Christmas musical comedy. [21 Dec 2001, p.C5]","63","47673"
"8663","I don't know if it was intentional, but Drake seems to come out of the same sandy hole in which our troops found the cowering Saddam Hussein.","63","359013"
"8664","Pixels is a blast of energetic fun.","63","2120120"
"8665","One could argue that Crank works best as a comedy. It's occasionally funny, and some times VERY funny.","63","479884"
"8666","The film’s habit of courting and then insulting the viewer is a conscious nod to the cycles of abuse that mark Tonya Harding’s story, but the filmmakers’ attempts to implicate their audience are I, Tonya's broken shoelace, too pat and glib to be convincing.","63","5580036"
"8667","The choppy film is like a composition crowded with competing themes.","63","166943"
"8668","The film has such a goofy sense of humor and affection for its premise that its uneven narrative is sometimes only as frustrating as a little static on an old VHS.","63","5805752"
"8669","Forte and company have managed to make crude and lewd dunderheadedness laugh-out-loud funny here and there, and that, I guess, is something of an achievement.","63","1470023"
"8670","Empire of the Sun is an imperfect film, but at its best it's grand and haunting in ways that only a movie can be. [11 Dec 1987]","63","92965"
"8671","All of the pieces fall into place by the third act -- or most of them, anyway. But Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy is such a cold, unemotional film that getting there is a chore, muting the payoff.","63","1340800"
"8672","Derivative and flawed. But it does throw off a few sparks.","63","181984"
"8673","It's to these Angels' credit that they, like the movie, are at least intermittent fun.","63","160127"
"8674","Its seriousness is welcome. It's also a burden the film can't completely surmount.","63","257044"
"8675","Though obviously aimed at a younger audience, The Goonies is packed with four-letter words. Sure kids speak like that, but writer Chris Columbus and director Richard Donner rely on obscenities as a substitution for clever punch lines, tossing in a few sex jokes and a touch of racist humor as well.","63","89218"
"8676","Kevin Spacey delivers his least-mannered, most effective big-screen performance in years as the voice of the nearly omniscient computer-robot, GERTY, whose silky ambiguity resembles HAL's in Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey.""","63","1182345"
"8677","There is a keen intellect behind this devoutly defiant fable.","63","120655"
"8678","Despite its flaws, Sleepy Hollow stays with you, the dark beauty of its images powerful enough to invade your dreams.","63","162661"
"8679","This 19th Bond installment is passable, but only just.","63","143145"
"8680","The film belongs to Steve Martin, whose crisp, almost bitter delivery, although frequently off-putting, manages to put an edge to a film that, without him, would be mush.","63","101862"
"8681","Clooney is too talented and committed a filmmaker not to get in his licks. But with Suburbicon, he's made a movie that is tonally at war with itself.","63","491175"
"8682","The cinematic equivalent of cotton candy: certainly not unpleasant, but not especially satisfying despite the sweet taste.","63","112697"

"8684","Star Trek II may seem too mechanical for some tastes, but there is something nice about seeing a movie that stresses the values of friendship, loyalty and good deeds. [05 June 1984]","63","88170"
"8685","By modeling its structure so closely after ""All the President's Men,"" Spotlight only draws closer attention to its lack of scope and ambition.","63","1895587"

"8687","There's something in Shallow Grave that is admirable, beyond its obvious display of youthful talent. [24 Feb 1995]","63","111149"
"8688","Without a persuasive ending, Zodiac is an exercise in frustration if not futility. But before it hits the inevitable wall, it does something better than most genre films even attempt: it perfectly depicts the obsession that often overtakes cops and reporters involved in high-profile crimes.","63","443706"
"8689","Has its heart in the right place -- and in a season filled with somber or goopy Oscar contenders, it makes a perfectly decent date movie.","63","35423"
"8690","Sitting through it is like cramming a decade’s worth of daily television-watching into a single sitting.","63","49261"
"8691","Director Espinosa shoots virtually everything in tight but wobbly close-up, and the human and vehicular combat often brakes right at the edge of visual incoherence. Just as often the brakes give out completely.","63","1599348"
"8692","You have to overlook a whole lot of guff in order to enjoy the slight but pleasurable entertainment of The Switch.","63","889573"
"8693","Kilmer seems less dangerous than Morrison, but it's a blessing in the most uncompromising bio of a please- don't-move-next-door type since ""Raging Bull."" [01 Mar 1991]","63","101761"
"8694","There's plenty going on but never any real magic.","63","482571"
"8695","The film's dramatic underpinning and the way it addresses impending empty nest syndrome are solid but the comedy varies from mildly amusing to achingly awful.","63","2390361"
"8696","Plays like a long TV sketch, but with an array of characters, themes, subplots and situations just clever enough to keep it moving, and to give cover to its underlying cynicism.","63","266452"
"8697","As a movie, Heist is merely an amiable time-killer. But it presents a terrific argument for federalizing airport security.","63","252503"
"8698","A worthy, if flawed, piece of entertainment.","63","258153"
"8699","Sunshine can be seen as a story about science and religion, about the rational mind and the mad. But at a certain point, like a dying star about to pop into eternal nothingness, the movie can't be seen as anything - it just implodes.","63","448134"
"8700","Whereas the film is a marvel to look at, it’s unfortunately not much in the song or story department, as Danny Elfman’s musical numbers are—save for the opening’s boisterous “This Is Halloween”—generally banal and unmemorable, and the plot, despite only having to fill out a paltry 76 minutes, ultimately as emaciated and insubstantial as its leading bags of bones.","63","107688"
"8701","By reducing its principals to stock figures in an extended chess game, it ends up providing steady, neatly staged thrills, but little else of substance.","63","2359024"
"8702","The actor's job here is the hardest to pull off, since practical skepticism in a Tim Burton picture is next to villainy. Yet Crudup suggests complex grown-up feelings that makes the rest of Big Fish feel like an earnest collection of magic tricks.","63","319061"
"8703","The film grows on you, but more substance and less calculated quirks would have been a royal treat.","63","265666"
"8704","A formulaic thriller, treated in a style that's just shy of outright parody.","63","139414"
"8705","Reynolds, who directed the little-seen but brilliantly realized The Beast , makes the camera his plaything in Prince of Thieves. This makes the movie at times obnoxious -- he repeatedly jams the lens into the bad guys' faces -- but most of it is highly watchable. Reynolds captures the dark and dank stuff better than Tim Burton did in Batman , and the action sequences thrust and cut across the screen. [14 June 1991, p.G5]","63","102798"
"8706","Julia is the story of a fascinating woman, told from the point of view of someone who hardly knew her. That is, I realize, an unkind judgment against Lillian Hellman, whose wartime memoirs provide the inspiration for the story. But this movie's problems start with its point of view, and it never quite recovers from them.","63","76245"
"8707","The film's vague recycling theme strikes me as a veiled admission of recycled ideas. Maybe Zucker should have been bold and called it The Naked Gun 2 1/2: The Smell of Money. [29 June 1991, p.E1]","63","102510"
"8708","Poor Ben Stiller can't distill the darkness, slapstick and fantasy into a consistent directorial tone, but the leads' expert give-and-take make the movie far from unbearable. [14 June 1996, p.1D]","63","115798"
"8709","Slowly loses its grip, becoming just another story about infidelity, albeit an exceptionally polished, well-acted one.","63","404203"
"8710","In Marlo, Diablo Cody has created her most complicated character to date. Would that her writing displayed similar richness and empathy in painting the film's supporting characters.","63","5610554"
"8711","It's nice to see Clooney choosing something offbeat (as opposed to ""safe"") for his first outing behind the camera. If he continues to develop, he has the potential to become a good director -- he's just not there yet.","63","270288"
"8712","Until the last 15 minutes, What Lies Beneath is a well-paced maze that earns every gasp from its audience.","63","161081"
"8713","Perry tries to be faithful to the play and also to his own boldly and simply told stories, and the two styles don't fit together.","63","1405500"
"8714","There's only so much humor you can wring from the f-bomb, even if you are a cute animated alien.","63","1092026"
"8715","Too loud, bright and shallow for its subject: a movie that pushes too many obvious buttons to build naturally to the big, heartbreaking climax it obviously wants.","63","120686"
"8716","Fosse’s attempt to give us Lenny Bruce as society’s victim and a martyr to noble causes never quite works, and so the movie becomes just several good scenes and a fine Hoffman performance, not a persuasive portrait of a man.","63","71746"
"8717","The drawback of the film's visual approach, however, is a considerable one. The relentless first-person shooting in End of Watch - figurative and literal - is less about YouTube factuality than it is about Xbox gaming reconfigured for the movies.","63","1855199"
"8718","Essentially Masterpiece Theatre comfort food, a chance to watch fine actors act without too many complications.","63","1441951"
"8719","Even if a lot of adults have problems following this picture 100%, look for computer-savvy teen-agers to guarantee this sometimes original but too often derivative time-killer a shelf life.","63","133093"
"8720","This movie has an aura of forced tragedy, like a fourth-generation version of ""Requiem for a Heavyweight.""","63","1125849"
"8721","A serviceable thriller - no more, no less.","63","372183"
"8722","It's almost wonderful. For an hour or so, it is. Funny, scary, occasionally wonderful. On the strength of that first hour, this should be one of the summer's big pictures. Nonetheless, when WarGames goes wrong, it's a great disappointment. [3 June 1983, p.D1]","63","86567"
"8723","For girls and boys who like games, ideas and toys, Back to the Future probably is worth an afternoon's good giggle. But baby boomers be forewarned: You had a better guffaw at Son of Flubber! [3 July 1985, p.D9]","63","88763"
"8724","Ronit’s ebullient spirit spreads vivacity, discontent, and resentment. She offers the possibility of choice — between secular independence or religious tradition. But Lelio opts for an insipid neutrality that does a disservice to both.","63","6108178"
"8725","At once cluttered and cavernous, hysterical and static, romantic and cynical, The Zero Theorem works most effectively moment by moment and in the details.","63","2333804"
"8726","The movie is antic, bouncing frantically from one story element to another, and poor Stevens, looking electrocuted and sleep-deprived, plays Dickens like the Man Who Invented Meth.","63","6225520"
"8727","Unexpectedly, one of the better F-man outings. [11 Aug 1989, p.2D]","63","97981"
"8728","A well-made, confident piece of entertainment that lacks the poetry and nuance of the first film and gets less interesting as its narrative thinness is revealed but never feels like something that’s being phoned in to make a quick buck.","63","2652118"
"8729","Although mixing teen humor with sentiment will never be done as well as in ""American Pie,"" John Tucker Must Die has just enough heart to entertain the ""MySpace"" set.","63","455967"
"8730","Even an act of noble sacrifice late in the film has a faintly goofy tone to it, reflective of Shane Black's streak of puckish nihilism. That attitude makes him a perfect fit for this franchise, which lost its thematic viciousness after the anti-imperialist original.","63","3829266"
"8731","A little bit like a barroom brawl: noisy, senseless, silly but somehow watchable.","63","108358"
"8732","This movie is exceptionally brutal, cruel, savage and without conscience -- and that's just the comic parts. In contrast, the violent action sequences are quite entertaining.","63","122151"
"8733","The story keeps reinventing itself (some of the later plot twists are among the funniest), but a little goes a long way at 112 minutes - maybe 25 minutes more than this sporadically pointed conceit really needs.","63","120601"
"8734","Even at its most enjoyable, Eight Legged Freaks is disappointing -- it grazes your funny bone instead of tickling it like crazy.","63","271367"
"8735","Anderson loses his way, failing to thin out the novel and its overload of characters, piling scene upon scene that neither amusingly complicates the plot, nor advances it. Phoenix, however, is never less than fun.","63","1791528"
"8736","The Accountant keeps you hanging on all the way to the looney-toon ending, well past the point where your higher brain functions have called it a night. It’s not a good movie but it’s not a bad way to kill a few hours.","63","2140479"
"8737","The only thing that differentiates it from far too many other uninspired rom-coms is that some of the material is funny and there is an occasional edge to the repartee. Beyond that, however, it's a cookie-cutter movie, and the cookies are pretty stale.","63","1142988"
"8738","Eddie Murphy looks like the latest victim of the Star Magic Syndrome, in which it is assumed that a movie will be a hit simply because it stars an enormously talented person. Thus it is not necessary to give much thought to what he does or says, or to the story he finds himself occupying.","63","86960"
"8739","Happy Death Day twists the inherent repetitiveness of slashers to its advantage by exaggerating it to an impossible degree.","63","5308322"
"8740","Maya Forbes reveals herself as a sunny optimist, insistent on remembering the ecstatic highs and never dwelling on the despairing lows.","63","1969062"
"8741","The ripe dialogue (''I was their No. 1 son,'' wails the Penguin about the parents who flushed their deformed baby down the sewer, ''and they treated me like No. 2!'') and rich settings decked out in deco can't disguise that little happens. The frantic action circles the same city block, as if trying to find a spot to park. [19 June 1992, p.1D]","63","103776"
"8742","How do you turn a collection of New Yorker cartoons into a feature-length movie? And avoid the one-joke nature of the early-1960s television series that first tried to put it into dramatic form? The answer to both questions: you can't. [22 Nov 1991, p.3]","63","101272"
"8743","If nothing else, the mere sight of two popes drinking brews and watching a soccer game together is one of the more surreal things you’ll see at the movies this year.","63","8404614"
"8744","Henry Fool finds Hartley assimilating Godard's ideas with far more assurance than in previous pictures like ""Amateur"" and ""Flirt.""","63","122529"
"8745","Chronicle will never be mistaken for an artistic breakthrough, but it has a solid gimmick and pieces of it are brilliant.","63","1706593"
"8746","It’s engaging and watchable, even as it marches toward a seemingly suicidal climax. Yet the complex dynamic between Wardaddy and his men is far more fascinating.","63","2713180"
"8747","Devon Terrell's performance as Barry is warming, always leading with empathy and a genuine smile, contemplative whenever not sharing his thoughts.","63","5477566"
"8748","She (Blanchett) single-handedly forms the human heart of this engrossing, if ultimately preposterous, supernatural thriller.","63","219699"
"8749","Neither fish nor fowl, neither foul nor inspiring, director and co-writer Darren Aronofsky's strange and often rich new movie Noah has enough actual filmmaking to its name to deserve better handling than a plainly nervous Paramount Pictures has given it.","63","1959490"
"8750","In broad strokes, Westmoreland’s film succeeds as an inspirational period tale so much for today about a woman seizing her independence.","63","5437928"
"8751","Excels at bringing on the high-power pyrotechnics.","63","1245526"
"8752","The best in the latest crop of slasher remakes. Admittedly, that is faint praise.","63","844708"
"8753","The film's empowering themes of feminine strengths and bonds eventually flourish in novel fashion.","63","2294629"
"8754","As fun as it is at times -- particularly early on -- the longer The Sorcerer's Apprentice goes on, the more the magic wears off.","63","963966"
"8755","What They Had gracefully coasts on its patient observations of one family’s dynamics, but once the third act hits, Elizabeth Chomko goes about neatly tidying up seemingly every loose end.","63","6662736"
"8756","Entertaining in spots, obvious and irritating in others, with a one-note schticky performance from Christopher Waltz as Walter, Big Eyes is a strangely conventional entry in Tim Burton's filmography.","63","1126590"
"8757","For better or worse, though, this adaptation of the mega-hit Broadway musical fits neither description, largely because it lives in that kinda-sorta, okay-not-great, this-worked-that-didn't in-between for which words like ""better"" and ""worse"" fall woefully short.","63","1707386"
"8758","Charming, if terribly overstuffed, vision of romantic London gridlock.","63","314331"
"8759","Elf is jolly but could have been jollier, funny but could have been funnier, charming but ... well, point made.","63","319343"
"8760","While just a jot less fun than its predecessor, Pitch Perfect 2 is a worthy sequel in tone, even if the story feels padded with a few too many montages.","63","2848292"
"8761","It’s a wildly inconsistent film, sometimes disappointingly clunky and as superficial as the world it’s mocking, but it’s also an ambitious piece of work with unforgettable imagery and an ace ensemble.","63","7043012"
"8762","A Bourne movie turned just askew enough to be funny, American Ultra trains a bemused eye on a trope ripe for a ribbing.","63","3316948"
"8763","It's a fearsome and giddily unhinged performance in a movie that isn't entirely sure what to do with it.","63","1403177"
"8764","Stuntman (“Fight Club,””300”) turned director (he had a hand in “John Wick”) David Leitch proves he was the right guy for the job with every furious blast of onscreen mayhem.","63","2406566"
"8765","But this isn't Diceman's feat of clay. Instead, Ford Fairlane runs fairly well on high-octane silliness. [11 Jul 1990, p.4D]","63","98987"
"8766","This one aims for bleak and hits it.","63","884328"
"8767","Heard sets herself up as a Megan Fox with talent. And Cage? He delivers. Mock him for his bad choices if you will, but consider this. Who else could have made this work, or would even want to?","63","1502404"
"8768","Hollywood will simplify it to that big concept, and trim writer-director Maren Ade’s flaccid storytelling and many aimless scenes into something tighter, funnier and almost certainly less German.","63","4048272"
"8769","It's a misfire--but a fascinating, magnetic misfire, a film full of first-rate talents forced into absurdity, struggling to bring believability to nonsense. [22 September 1995, Friday, p. C]","63","114369"
"8770","The film is never more than an amalgamation of other movies.","63","993842"
"8771","Breach is competently made but, aside from Cooper's performance, there's nothing here worth getting excited about.","63","401997"
"8772","A nice little mystery thriller that takes a wrong turn on the way to its climax and morphs into a slasher movie.","63","486822"
"8773","Crazy Rich Asians puts its emphasis on “Crazy Rich,” and “Asians,” when a little more “Crazy” would get us through its glitzy two hours with less tedium and more style.","63","3104988"
"8774","The entertainment value in a straight-up genre picture like this is how fraught each new corner of peril that they turn manages to be. And there’s plenty of that. And damned if Aja and his cast find some actual emotion in all this, too.","63","8364368"
"8775","What Body Double lacks is rigorous editing that would have pared down this story to the tight, thoughtful thriller it could be. Instead, in Body Double as it now plays, De Palma runs wild with his own violent flourishes.","63","86984"
"8776","The first half of License to Drive, which is mostly concerned with taking the lessons and passing the test and getting the license, is very funny. The second half, which is mostly an extended chase scene in which a hapless teenager's grandfather's Cadillac is wrecked by a drunk, is much more predictable.","63","95519"
"8777","Ward does manage to pump the film with tension in the climactic, will-the-Indians-beat-the-Yankees sequence, and I found Major League hard to resist in its last 20 minutes or so -- even though it's sappy enough to make Levinson's prettifying of The Natural seem positively dour by contrast. Maybe it's just the season. [7 Apr 1989, p.1]","63","97815"
"8778","Jonze seems to be heading for a far quirkier ending than the one he actually delivers, but he does tap into the zeitgeist with his unlikely romantic fable.","63","1798709"
"8779","Highly polished yet never quite slick, it devolves now and then into cartoonish cutesiness with its broadly drawn minor characters.","63","3236120"
"8780","Damned if Parker hasn't done it again. An intermittently good filmmaker but a consistently bad polemicist, he may well sway opinion here -- but, oops, not in the hoped-for direction.","63","289992"
"8781","One of the few video game movies to truly re-create the gaming experience -- from the three-dimensional maps to the structure of encountering increasingly grisly and dangerous foes at higher levels of play.","63","120804"
"8782","The movie is slight and, at 75 minutes without end credits, barely qualifies as a feature-length film. But Tomlin is a wonder.","63","4270516"
"8783","So which side of the movie finally prevails — the lackluster conventionality of its text or the breathtaking singularity of its visuals and action? The latter does, if just by the nose on Brad Pitt’s perfectly imperfect face. Combined with the film’s lavish technical achievements, his classic movie star sturdiness makes Ad Astra a memorable filmgoing experience even as the story it tells slips off into the ether.","63","2935510"
"8784","It doesn't have that sneaky sense of awful things about to happen. Scott makes the hero so rational, normal and self-possessed that we never feel he's in real danger; we go through this movie with too much confidence.","63","80516"
"8785","If you can convince yourself that this movie has a reason to exist (I can't), then this big-screen recycling of the popular early-'70s TV series is not half bad. [17 Feb 1995, p.13]","63","112572"
"8786","It’s light, a little hard to follow the occasionally funny exchanges with all the talking over one another, and perfectly watchable, a real novelty in the Sandler canon if nothing really new for Baumbach.","63","5536736"
"8787","A revisiting of George Pal's 1960 adaptation of the H. G. Wells novel. Pal's take on the book was visually delightful and occasionally clever; this one is always workmanlike and mainly pedestrian.","63","268695"
"8788","Watchable, illuminating, and ultimately unmemorable — inspiring without being inspired.","63","4669788"
"8789","It aims straight for our hearts, sometimes hitting the target, especially in some of the quieter scenes with Conor and his mother. But then the preachy tree rears its thorny head, and it keeps on talking and explaining, long after we get it, we get it, we get it.","63","3416532"
"8790","Look out for everything, and listen, too, because Suspects is one of the most densely plotted mysteries in memory.","63","114814"
"8791","A surprisingly thoughtful romantic comedy that shirks a great deal of reason and consequence in the name of love.","63","2194499"
"8792","Stretched both timewise and for plausibility.","63","887912"
"8793","Good but not-good-enough schlocker.","63","2184339"
"8794","Until Richard Wenk's script drives the characters into a brick wall of pukey sentiment, it's a wild ride.","63","450232"
"8795","What unites the film’s two halves — what makes it worth watching, period — is the road Close’s Joan travels as she decides whether to reclaim authorship of her own life. It’s a diamond forged under pressure — a performance of great fury that only finds its voice at the end.","63","3750872"
"8796","Batman is largely content to skim the surface and bask in the light of its visual style.","63","96895"
"8797","I was interested all through the movie--interested, but not riveted. I cared, but not quite enough.","63","228750"
"8798","The performances are uniformly top-notch. It was a treat to see Ortiz, an actor known on screen mostly for his impressive cameos in movies like ""El Cantante,"" in a leading part enabling him to express his considerable emotional range.","63","1278379"
"8799","Adapted with unusual faithfulness from John Guare's much-heralded 1990 play, the movie, directed by Fred Schepisi with a screenplay by the playwright, is nothing if not frenetic. And yet it attempts to explore a slew of profound ideas -- about race, social class, art and the whole nature of experience among a very particular and unusually sophisticated segment of contemporary urban American society. [22 Dec 1993, p.48]","63","108149"
"8800","While there are humorous and poignant moments, this angst-filled story of tender kisses, awkward dances, friends drifting apart, kindly English teachers, unrequited crushes and drug-addled partying has a nagging sense of deja vu.","63","1659337"
"8801","[Cage] cracks wise throughout the third act and is almost entertaining enough to make this absurdly energetic movie recommendable.","63","117500"
"8802","Won't change your world, but it's attractive and Smith the Elder, lowering his voice to subterranean James Earl Jones levels, delivers a shrewd minimalist performance. His son may get there yet.","63","1815862"
"8803","The overstuffed farce remains, but the caustic leanness and meanness of the original are gone with the Mississippi wind. That leaves us to settle for occasionally funny moments in an otherwise uneven picture.","63","335245"
"8804","Seven Years in Tibet, however flawed, has feeling and purpose. It bears witness.","63","120102"
"8805","One can excuse the movie's missteps and melodramatic moments in the greater interest of the strong statement it makes about our health care system.","63","251160"
"8806","In a summer of low movie expectations and worse results, Fantastic Four is a not-so-bad mindless bit of camp escapism that doesn't try to eclipse its dime-store comic book roots.","63","120667"
"8807","Forgettably entertaining/entertainingly forgettable.","63","4779682"
"8808","Most of the humor in Your Highness is obvious, tepid, and often crude. There are some amusing one-liners but the majority of the comedy makes one realize how brilliant ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" is.","63","1240982"
"8809","In a season mostly given over to unwatchable movies being cleared off studio shelves, it's at least about something. And there's no denying the lurid urgency with which it jumps off the screen.","63","179626"
"8810","Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre.","63","5742374"
"8811","Better than mid90s’ treatment of adults is its evocation of the euphoria that comes from discovering one’s place in the world, and confidence—highlighted by Stevie’s nerve-wracked first sexual experience—as well as the way skating provides a liberating release, and a surrogate family, for these unruly teens.","63","5613484"
"8812","Based on a popular children's book by Chris Van Allsburg and directed by that ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"" guy Joe Johnston, Jumanji is a calculated but very entertaining special effects extravaganza. [15Dec1995 Pg. 01.D]","63","113497"
"8813","For a film so antsy to start that it barely flashes its opening title, Die Hard 2 takes a curiously long time to get off the ground. Like many return trips, what was once exhilarating is now a bit flat. [3 July 1990]","63","99423"
"8814","Three things and three things only keep Sex Drive from being teen-comedy landfill. The first is James Marsden, hilarious as the hero's bully-boy big brother. The second is Seth Green, beyond droll as an Amishman with attitude. The third is the Mexican doughnut costume.","63","1135985"
"8815","The Thing is basically just a geek show, a gross-out movie in which teenagers can dare one another to watch the screen. There's nothing wrong with that; I like being scared and I was scared by many scenes in The Thing. But it seems clear that Carpenter made his choice early on to concentrate on the special effects and the technology and to allow the story and people to become secondary.","63","84787"
"8816","Solondz's greatest success is the pederast, heartbreakingly played by Baker...Had Solondz reached that apex in the other stories, it would have been a masterpiece.","63","147612"
"8817","A cheekily gruesome and genuinely urgent entertainment, Blomkamp's latest nevertheless can't help but beg the question: Where's Snake Plissken when you need him?","63","1535108"
"8818","As Alien, a gun-crazy Florida drug dealer with tats, beaded cornrows and a grill any rapper would envy, Franco is a bug-f--k blast. Too bad the movie itself is rarely as outrageous as he is.","63","2101441"
"8819","The Hornitor and Scorpitron vs. Ninja Falcon Megazord matchup, produced with a snazzy mix of models and computer animation, deftly evokes the spirit of good ol' Godzilla movies and Japanese cartoons. It'll have you standing in your seat yelling, Go! Go! Power Rangers! Or, at the very least, keep you from dozing off. [30 June 1995, p.05]","63","113820"
"8820","The movie is all surface and trades on fortune-cookie wisdom.","63","1341188"
"8821","Full of love, Spaceballs is full of laughs; after 13 years of screen disappointments, Brooks has almost delivered another Young Frankenstein. May the box office be with it. [24 Jun 1987, p.1D]","63","94012"
"8822","A standard issue, first-movie navel-gaze whose cobwebs Braff meticulously sweeps away by directing the bejesus out of it. The photography makes loveliness out of the film's dank, hung-over atmosphere; the camerawork and editing lend the movie a luscious daydreaminess.","63","333766"
"8823","Every time you start resisting, somehow the film makes the sale, again.","63","1291584"
"8824","The whole caper loses its rhythm and its direction around the two-thirds mark. By the finish, the punch has left the lines, and the once-purposeful energy goes mindlessly manic - gone are both the point and the parody.","63","93822"
"8825","If this melodrama has that haven't-we-met-before look, it's because it combines elements of ""The Caine Mutiny"" (Gandolfini's Winter is Queeg-like) with those of ""Stalag 17.""","63","272020"
"8826","Far from proving the reality of the Horatio Alger myth it peddles, Chris Gardner's story is worth celebrating precisely because he managed to beat the odds stacked so high against him. Steve Conrad's screenplay is also curiously but insistently silent on the subject of race.","63","454921"
"8827","A laugh a minute? Liar LiarJim Carrey's forced truthfulness means a lot of mildly funny facial gyrations.","63","119528"
"8828","Though it's no ""Monty Python,"" Hot Fuzz is a clever, over-the-top marriage of mayhem and merriment.","63","425112"
"8829","You don’t realize how much a good horror movie depends on acting until you stumble in that rare one whose cast actually gets it right.","63","4786282"
"8830","One of Woody Allen's strongest and most pointed films in over a decade despite mildly falling victim to his recent propensity for clunky narrative development, cynicism, and stereotypical characterizations.","63","2334873"
"8831","From my doddering perspective - rheumy with a view - Volume 3 puts plenty of cinema into the picture but leeches all the charm out of the tale.","63","304141"
"8832","I laughed. I did not always feel proud of myself while I was laughing, however.","63","158983"
"8833","The most thrilling and haunting details here are actively undermined by the chief technical gimmick of the film.","63","8579674"
"8834","The Ruins is, with one major caveat, about as good an adaptation of Scott Smith's bestselling novel as Hollywood was ever going to make.","63","963794"
"8835","More than once during A Scanner Darkly, you find yourself wishing these characters would just shut up.","63","405296"
"8836","Ryan Boden and Anna Fleck convey an engagingly low-key atmosphere, pervasive with wayward souls haunted by poor choices.","63","2349144"
"8837","It may have the faintest relationship to any kind of reality, but Jones' tart performance cuts through the saccharine.","63","1405365"
"8838","Leaves the audience on such a devastatingly dramatic ledge.","63","119349"
"8839","With Malcolm X, Lee doesn’t so much inject his sensibilities into the lifeline of his subject, but rather comes to see how his place as a film director can be integrated within the social movement of X’s message.","63","104797"
"8840","Gold never settles on a coherent point of view. Is the film supposed to be a critique of capitalism or is it a Horatio Alger story about a self-made man preyed upon by wall street?","63","1800302"
"8841","Randall Park’s interpretation of Kim is dark, and darkly funny, a delusional turn with wincing, believable bits of psychoanalysis.","63","2788710"
"8842","The movie may lack a lot of things, but it doesn't lack comic timing--or, in its own way, a nose for the news.","63","357413"
"8843","Vox Lux is “A Star is Born” for the bubblegum babies of pop.","63","5960374"
"8844","It would be gratifying to report that there's a lot more to K-Pax than Spacey at the top of his form, but there isn't.","63","272152"
"8845","It's almost three hours long, and that's a lot of time to invest in what is, essentially, a theme-park attraction you can't ride.","63","449088"
"8846","Tremors is never earth-shattering, but always competent. Modest in intention, fine in execution, it just wants to make a body smile, to stick a happy face on the monster movie. There are worse faults. [20 Jan 1990]","63","100814"
"8847","Stirring at times, soggy and overly sentimental at others, the film moves surprisingly slow, even though its action, which takes place over many years of legal maneuvering, has been condensed for narrative expediency.","63","2404425"
"8848","A cartoon with better animation and livelier action, if fewer jokes. If there’s one thing these sweet-message/great flying sequence movies don’t need is fewer jokes.","63","1646971"
"8849","The most surprising performance is Lively’s. As the cheeky Emily, the star of such recent thrillers as “All I See Is You” and “The Shallows” finally gets the chance to be funny. She proves quite adept at it","63","7040874"
"8850","A lightweight, formulaic piece of fluff, but you wouldn't know that by Meryl Streep's performance.","63","458352"
"8851","It’s not a “bad” film, but Billie Jean King’s story could have been so much deeper. It’s a movie that doesn’t hit nearly as hard as she did.","63","4622512"
"8852","At times the film seems like a horrifying Nancy Drew story or a more sophisticated Scooby-Doo episode without the dog and with a face full of spiders.","63","3387520"
"8853","A touching but fairly clumsy effort that only acquires the depths of sadness and resilience it needs if you have the memory of the earlier film shoring it up. It proves that second-hand grace is, after all, still grace.","63","6018306"
"8854","Exhibiting high spirits and a crazed comic energy. It doesn't quite work, but it goes down swinging--with a disembodied hand.","63","138510"
"8855","Wisely unbiased-but also unfocused, uneducated, and underachieving-which makes for an occasionally hilarious, frequently anemic parody that misses its opportunity to permanently document a scathing critique of current events.","63","372588"
"8856","It's not bad enough to walk out on but neither is it good enough to walk into.","63","472198"
"8857","Ultimately, World comes down to two inherently appealing icons in an imperfect casting fit. Costner modifies his Louisiana accent from JFK, and again we're forced to accept it on good faith. He's never quite believable, but he is tolerable in a role that demands a star presence. [24 Nov 1993, p.4D]","63","107808"
"8858","As scary Halloween movies go, Thirteen Ghosts' ""Oh, please"" factor is pretty darn high.","63","245674"
"8859","The treat in Trick or Treat is that the film has a sense of humor about itself, and a genuine feeling for the travails that follow puberty. [29 Oct 1986, p.D10]","63","92112"
"8860","The Frighteners never finds a satisfying groove -- comedy-horror hybrids are formidably challenging -- but moments in it reach giddy, frantic heights. [19 July 1996, p.5G]","63","116365"
"8861","Despite some emotional dips and a see-it-to-believe-it load of schmaltz at the end, The Bucket List is mostly a joy ride with good company, and the actors obviously were having a high time on their traveling boondoggle.","63","825232"
"8862","Flawed and uneven, but vigorous and imaginative, The Stunt Man is a brash, whirlwind action comedy about the paranoid uncertainties of a fugitive who takes refuge with a movie company on location. [24 Oct 1980, p.B1]","63","81568"
"8863","It's a cut above most spooky-kid movies, with a twist that sets it apart.","63","1148204"
"8864","Rent, for all its good intentions and sensitivity, is easy to forget but easy to forgive. The music and direction feel generic but the cast deserves credit for squeezing every possible drop of emotion out of the material.","63","294870"
"8865","Part of the reason The Devil's Own is endurable is because, in spite of various script deficiencies, both of the stars -- Pitt and Harrison Ford -- have an undeniable screen presence. And, while star power can't save a sinking movie, it can at least keep it afloat longer.","63","118972"
"8866","At times it's laugh-out-loud funny. In this ode to the passing of childhood, circa 1962, screenwriter David Mickey Evans has partly succeeded in mythologizing something that everyone treasures: the proverbial perfect summer of youth. [7 Apr 1993]","63","108037"
"8867","It's a brutal, merciless, somber picture, utterly devoid of the heart-tugging sentimentality that always creeps into even his best films.","63","408306"
"8868","Despite its many shortcomings and periods of ridiculousness, it's a fast-paced, often humorous, entertaining piece of work. [13 Dec 1991, p.3G]","63","102266"
"8869","The tone, which veers uncertainly between dark comedy and suspense, is uneven, and the characters are not vivid enough to stabilize the load of a shifting, runaway plot.","63","124198"
"8870","My Cousin Vinny is not without its flaws: The movie is overlong, the middle section sags, and there are a couple of running gags that simply aren't very funny. And while the film's courtroom climax is preposterous, the last half hour is definitely worth sticking around for: Pesci makes it a hoot. [13 Mar 1992, p.8]","63","104952"
"8871","Marriage Story is almost funny enough and touching just often enough to endorse. It’s good, but it’s no “Scenes from a Marriage” or “Husbands and Wives” or hell, “Company,” for that matter. It’s just Netflixable.","63","7653254"
"8872","As much Fosse as Fellini. It’s a shadow of a shadow, refracted through a fun-house mirror. For all the noise and color, it feels like an exercise and not a natural expression.","63","875034"
"8873","In a virtuoso turn, Tommy Lee Jones delivers an over-the-top performance, but it works for the obvious reason that everything about Cobb is oversized. Except for one commodity - there's not an ounce of sentimentality on the guy (nor in this film - it too is unlikely to please the crowd). [23 Dec 1994]","63","109450"
"8874","While heartfelt and beautifully crafted, Bringing Out the Dead is too freighted with its protagonist's failed savior complex and is surprisingly lacking in primal impact.","63","163988"
"8875","Black Rain is really an extended exercise in pure style, a pretty picture in constant motion painted by a very commercial artist. In fact, the style is so uncontaminated by substance that everything here - plot, character, theme - gets subordinated to the glitzy sights and ambient sounds. [22 Sep 1989]","63","96933"
"8876","A rowdy blast because the spiky young cast treats the played-out script like virgin territory. That's acting!","63","815236"
"8877","A second-rate nightmare: the Reagan generation meets Leatherhead with flickers of brilliance drowned in blood and snobbery, a corpse dressed by Bloomingdale's.","63","144084"
"8878","A decent futuristic action picture with some great sets, some intriguing ideas, and a few images that will stay with me.","63","114898"
"8879","The flight sequences in “Top Gun” may arouse aerial buffs. Still, this movie approaches its subject in such juvenile, superficial way that it’s clear the producers were merely in a hurry to cash in on Hollywood’s new wave of Rambo-style patriotism.","63","92099"
"8880","The direction by Kevin Kölsch and Dennis Widmyer, is competent and efficient, if not especially stylish or ambitious, and the squeamish should know the movie is backloaded with stabby, graphic, slasher-movie content.","63","837563"
"8881","The film's two big flaws are readily apparent: a clunky screenplay and the miscasting of the lead character.","63","308383"
"8882","The stunt work and special effects are top flight; Schwarzenegger and the kid are just fine, but we can't help but want this film to stop kidding around and thrill us. [18 Jun 1993, p.C]","63","107362"
"8883","Norton, who wrote and directed Motherless Brooklyn, does his best to imitate the genre’s snappy dialogue and clever red herrings; but what starts out as a mystery as intelligent as it is intriguing winds up being over-plotted didactic.","63","385887"
"8884","A cautionary tale, a warning not to gather all of your neurotic friends in one room - or better yet, not to have so many neurotic friends.","63","254099"
"8885","The Cabin in the Woods, regardless of its many genealogical links to prior Whedon creations, is an ideal Hollywood film in the Age of Pixar: spectacle for spectacle's sake, but infiltrated by intelligent commentary and an atmosphere of generosity and inclusion.","63","1259521"
"8886","The Conjuring is like a prequel to 40 years of demonic possession thrillers.","63","1457767"
"8887","More clever than coherent.","63","120789"
"8888","Anonymous is ridiculous, and like Oliver Stone's ""JFK"" it sells its political conspiracy theories by weight and by volume. But dull, it's not.","63","1521197"
"8889","Downey appears to like all this make-believe. Even the clunky dialogue sounds witty out of his mouth. This is not a part that makes great demands on his talent, and his slummy approach to it is amusing.","63","371746"
"8890","It isn’t “Working Girl” — Second Act is more earnest and less funny — but it’s a pleasant enough diversion, helped along immensely by Lopez’s warm screen presence and by a first-rate Sassy Best Friend performance by Leah Remini.","63","2126357"
"8891","Biopic cliches hamstring producer-star Jennifer Lopez's pet project.","63","458522"
"8892","It is Rapace, the Swedish actress who gained worldwide recognition as Lisbeth Salander in the original adaptation of ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,"" who ends up the true heroine of Prometheus.","63","1446714"
"8893","It's a boldly attempted strike against the monolithic corporatization of fan service, and arguably one of the few films that defines dystopia as nothing less than a marketplace of trademarked, cross-promotional intellectual property. In other words, our here and now.","63","1677720"
"8894","J.C. Chandor creates an austere snapshot of human struggle, ingenuity, and perseverance, one that's predicated on Robert Redford's fantastic performance.","63","2017038"
"8895","Ezra Miller's sneering, absurdly precocious evil-child performance makes him just another bad-seed horror villain.","63","1242460"
"8896","A stirring if somewhat ham-fisted telling of a life that needs to be known by all Americans.","63","4648786"
"8897","As nimble as Aneesh Chaganty is in presenting his main character's multi-faceted interaction with technology in the first hour, the film suddenly morphs into a generic and manipulative missing-person thriller.","63","7668870"
"8898","At its best, The Time Traveler’s Wife does suggest the preciousness of a life that’s too often beyond our control. At its worst, it’s more than a little nuts.","63","452694"
"8899","The movie takes you over, shakes you for a couple of hours and then turns you back out into the street, limp. You've grown to know a lot about its characters. But when you think about them, you realize that you don't want to know this much. They're hollow men, on both sides. [15 Aug 1986, p.D1]","63","91474"
"8900","Not bad, but far from a classic.","63","67525"
"8901","Hail, Spartacus. You're no Kane, you're not even Lawrence. You're a movie dinosaur, lumbering and overpraised. But it's good to have you back. [8 May 1991, p.D1]","63","54331"
"8902","A damped-down return to the Kingdom of Far Far Away, lacking the comic energy of the first brilliant film and not measuring up to the second.","63","413267"
"8903","Krasinski makes suspension of disbelief easy, and the movie mostly works — I can’t remember the last time I was in a movie theater so quiet.","63","6644200"
"8904","Beowulf is many things, but boring isn't one of them.","63","442933"
"8905","Fortunately, the maudlin moments are offset by fine performances, flashes of humor and a visual sense that’s more astute than the script.","63","2404639"
"8906","This is a monument that should be visited, but it is a monument of importance only as a reminder of the thing it seeks to memorialize. Gandhi may not be a hagiographic embarrassment to its subject, but it's a waxworks movie, a victory for British reserve. [08 Dec 1982]","63","83987"
"8907","Whatever faults Avatar may have -- and there are many -- the movie succeeds in immersing you in a photorealistic, painstakingly detailed world more fully than any science fiction movie before.","63","499549"
"8908","Predictable and foolishly unsuspecting characters react in ways that make you want to shake them. But there's an undeniable sense of silly fun in this erotic thriller.","63","3181822"
"8909","Unfortunately, Mission: Impossible - which assembles a new Impossible Missions Force and plops it down in Kiev, Prague, London and Langley, Va. - doesn't have the momentum or suspense of De Palma's best pictures. It moves, awkwardly at times, from one elaborate set-piece to the next. [22 May 1996, p.E01]","63","117060"
"8910","Fusing teen comedy, bad-boy raunch, Tarantino-style gonzo mayhem, and tossing in a bloodthirsty little girl vigilante who swears like Steve Buscemi in a Coen brothers movie, the film has its moments of high-flying, low-down style. It’s also nowhere near as subversive as it thinks it is.","63","1250777"
"8911","Kafka is in glorious black and white, except for an extended color sequence near the end that recalls the visual transition in ""The Wizard of Oz."" The comparison is even more apropos: This middling pigmentary stunt has a lot of smoke and mirrors, a lot of mood, and too much put-on wizardry at its center. [4 Dec. 1991, p.5D]","63","102181"
"8912","The problems with Damon's character are the problem with the movie: It's about plot mechanics, not heart and soul.","63","258463"
"8913","There are a lot of words that come to mind when watching Luca Guadagnino’s remake of Suspiria: beautiful, gross, overwhelming, frustrating, disturbing, powerful, long, gross, audacious, baffling, explicit, extravagant and did I mention gross?","63","1034415"
"8914","As good as Gibson is, his character is still caught between the tragedy of the man and the absurdity of the Beaver. Fugitive thoughts of Señor Wences crept into my mind. I'm sorry, but they did.","63","1321860"
"8915","The verdict? King Kong may be a great movie event in a ""Jaws/Titanic"" sense of blockbuster impact and cultural talking point, but it is not a great movie.","63","360717"
"8916","When you pay good money to see an action movie, it's understood that you want it to be action-packed. You do not want it to be action-enhanced or action-flavoured or featuring accents of action.","63","306685"
"8917","An endearing, well-acted trifle with lovely intentions.","63","845046"
"8918","The Arrival is no Close Encounters of the Third Kind, but it does provide a solid second choice at the multiplex. [31 May 1996, p.5E]","63","115571"
"8919","Mainly, though, it's the performers who are having the last laugh.","63","415306"
"8920","There is no denying the emotional power of these scenes, but one wishes that Scorsese would end his Italian-American guilt trip and stop exposing mean-tempered, self-destructive characters like La Motta, whose personality problems, he apparently feels, stem from their cultural environment. Raging Bull ultimately has a numbing effect on the brain as if one's head had been pummeled by La Motta's so-called ""girlish"" fists.","63","81398"
"8921","As filler for the long, dry winter movie season, the movie is more than passable, and its sense of humor has a wicked, unforgiving spin that is decidedly pro-rodent.","63","310357"
"8922","While The Avengers exhibits exemplary craftsmanship, Joss Whedon hasn't made a great film.","63","848228"
"8923","Richard E. Grant is captivating on his own, but his rapport with Melissa McCarthy is so effortless that their characters’ conversations offer deeper pleasures than the main plot of the film.","63","4595882"
"8924","Though this new Hills is both scarier and smarter than 95 percent of the other horror product out there, it's also indicative of everything that's wrong with horror movies today.","63","454841"
"8925","A mixed bag with the promise of a better sequel.","63","120903"
"8926","By now, everyone knows what to expect from this kind of movie, but what’s surprising is how the low-budget rawness, cheap film stock bubbling over with grain, and washed-out lighting schemes give the film a kind of base in reality.","63","82418"
"8927","Gets by for many of the same reasons ""Date Night"" got by, all of them performance-related.","63","1321509"
"8928","For the most part, The Other Guys is seriously silly stuff, in the best sense.","63","1386588"
"8929","A Dangerous Method has plenty to say about sex, but it lacks much fire for it.","63","1571222"
"8930","It's the cinematic equivalent of one of those prop guns where you pull the trigger and a little flag comes out of the barrel, waving gaily.","63","173716"
"8931","That the film, directed in swift strokes by F. Gary Gray from a screenplay credited to Kurt Wimmer, doesn't really work - unrelentingly grim, unintentionally funny - is almost beside the point. It's a wild concept.","63","1197624"
"8932","Fletch needed an actor more interested in playing the character than in playing himself.","63","89155"
"8933","The final confrontation between the Hulk and Blonsky, now the roaring Abomination, is like the clash of Downey and Bridges in ""Iron Man,"" only not as exciting.","63","800080"
"8934","An enjoyable film, and yet it left me somehow unsatisfied...there is too much contrivance in the way [Austen] dispatches her men to London when she is done with them.","63","114388"
"8935","Upgrade is most effective when mining the comical and bizarre love-hate chemistry between Grey and Stem and pairing that singular conflict with batshit-crazy action, but the film’s follow-through is clunky and unfulfilling.","63","6499752"
"8936","The Hunger Games may be derivative, but it is engrossing and at times exciting. Implicitly, it argues that ""The Truman Show"" might have been improved by Ed Harris lobbing fireballs at Jim Carrey, and it's now clear what ""American Idol"" was missing all those years: a crossbow for Simon Cowell.","63","1392170"
"8937","Fast, well made and utterly inconsequential -- The Terminator is a vintage ""B,"" and it's good to know that Hollywood can still crank them out. [29 Oct 1984, p.C6]","63","88247"

"8941","Green Lantern does not intend to be plausible. It intends to be a sound-and-light show, assaulting the audience with sensational special effects. If that's what you want, that's what you get.","63","1133985"
"8942","The entire project is carefully wrought in visual terms and more than a little familiar. Sometimes even a well-applied pair of jumper cables can't do the trick.","63","1142977"
"8943","The movie version feels like a stately, but watered down, episode of ""Masterpiece Theatre"" fused with ""The English Patient.""","63","783233"
"8944","Coraline is a plucky heroine, and director Selig's imagination is indisputable. But the story falters in parts, and its dark tone could be off-putting for children.","63","327597"
"8945","Carpenter, an old hand at this horror stuff, delivers some convincingly creepy effects, but the narrative lacks any sustained dramatic pulse - its gallery of hallucinogenic scenes doesn't add up to much more than, well, a gallery of hallucinogenic scenes. [03 Feb 1995, p.5]","63","113409"

"8947","The best moments in Watchmen, then, work as delirious music-videos.","63","409459"
"8948","At the nasty center of the otherwise dutiful Denial is a slimy, self-aggrandizing upper-class blowhard of a bigot who believes he has every right to circulate hateful and hurtful falsehoods to his followers.","63","4645330"
"8949","It`s a shame to have to knock the otherwise beautiful and haunting picture, but when you`re watching a love story and you can`t stand the character who is being loved, that makes for a very frustrating movie-going experience.","63","89755"
"8950","Custody is concerned with the failure of process to discern human need and perversion, and Xavier Legrand rather ironically follows in the footsteps of bureaucracy by reducing people to statistics.","63","6002232"
"8951","mother!, for this viewer, felt long and punishing; artful yet self-sabotaging, eventually crumbling. I never looked away — but I never want to see it again.","63","5109784"
"8952","Alfred Hitchcock once said, ""Drama is life with the dull bits left out."" Well, Rachel Getting Married is drama with the dull bits left in.","63","1084950"
"8953","A lush, panoramic, dizzyingly portrait of the many-tentacled entrepreneur Howard Hughes.Unfortunately, though it may finally gain an Oscar for director Martin Scorsese, it is not his best work. The movie is disappointingly flat.","63","338751"
"8954","Ultimately, I found the story surrounding Equity — that it is a movie about women on Wall Street, financed largely by actual women on Wall Street — more interesting than the movie itself, but it does contain its share of memorable moments.","63","3958780"
"8955","Despite some fine, nuanced acting (it's Lane's movie, to be sure), Unfaithful doesn't get much deeper than a romance novel.","63","250797"
"8956","The problem with Mr. and Mrs. Smith is that it's really two movies in one. The first is a sly comedy/thriller worthy of Hitchcock, and the other is a big, noisy summer action flick.","63","356910"
"8957","It's the chemistry between the Arquettes (they met on the first film and married after the second) and their rapport with Campbell that sustains Scream 3 through its overly convoluted plot.","63","134084"
"8958","If this overcooked version of James Ellroy’s novel - inspired by a famous 1947 Los Angeles murder - is less than fully satisfying or even believable storytelling and acting, it’s still possible to get a kick out of this fever dream loaded with eye candy.","63","387877"
"8959","Writer-director Damien Chazelle (“Whiplash”) reaches for the stars, and cast the picture beautifully. But this throwback musical (songs by Justin Hurwitz) lurches along on show business cliches in between dreamy flights of fancy.","63","3783958"
"8960","Though a tacked-on fisticuffs finale has its charms, it rather contradicts the preceding. Mere subtleties are beyond Stallone and returning Rocky I director John G. Avildsen. [16 Nov 1990, p.4D]","63","100507"
"8961","Movies like Just Mercy spoon-feed everything to the viewer in easily digestible chunks that assume you know nothing, or worse, don’t know any better.","63","4916630"

"8963","Far too familiar.","63","191754"
"8964","The movie delivers, if you're looking for a big-screen, big-stunt, action blockbuster that happens to have the Bond brand name on it. If you're looking for a movie with narrative coherence that recreates, or develops, the Bond mythology that first came to screen in the early sixties, go back to your video store: The current Bond franchise is a Van Damme movie with a bigger budget and British accents. [19 Dec 1997, p.C6]","63","120347"
"8965","Hot Tub Time Machine should have been better than this. It could have been poignant.","63","1231587"
"8966","If the film is too similar to Ritchie's first movie, ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" with its multiple story lines, complex plotting, and double-crossing antics, it's at least colorfully told with dialogue that shines with the inventive slang of Ritchie's screenplay.","63","208092"
"8967","The premise of visiting so many pubs as a narrative device, however, bogs down the initially energetic pacing and goofiness. Piling on the mayhem renders The World's End a sometimes chaotic and uneven comedy.","63","1213663"

"8970","Even though we would see more of Jason over the years (first as a zombie, then battling a telekinetic super-girl, taking on Freddy Krueger within his own warped dreams, even hacking teens to bits in outer space), this one certainly felt as if it properly closed out the Friday the 13th series before it devolved into unadulterated camp.","63","87298"

"8975","Hook is full of funny and engaging moments, but they are separated by too many moments that are neither. It should have been written to be shorter, perhaps a brisk 90 minutes instead of the 135-minute behemoth it is now. [13 Dec. 1991, p.AE08]","63","102057"
"8976","Pedro Almodóvar’s latest only occasionally captures the spry, comedic rhythms and impassioned intensity of his finest work.","63","8291806"
"8977","Taking its title from the site where Christ was crucified, the controversy-courting film has a lot of Catholic church business (and doctrine) on its mind, and veers from poetically eloquent to jarringly blunt in hashing it all out.","63","2234003"
"8978","Girl With a Pearl Earring is really about watching paint dry. S l o w l y.","63","335119"

"8981","An entertaining mess. [19 Aug 1994, p.03]","63","109456"
"8982","In Synecdoche, Kaufman the screenwriter is not well-served by Kaufman the filmmaker. As a director, his propensity for heavyosity leadens rather than leavens this affair.","63","383028"
"8983","First-time director Ari Aster hits a home run when it comes to an overall sense of impending doom. Sadly, Aster’s story isn’t as waterproof as his stylistic aptitude.","63","7784604"
"8984","It's big, brash and dramatically it goes in circles. The first two may be enough for most people, especially if they're into Formula One racing, to overlook the third.","63","1979320"
"8985","The punch line isn't that funny.","63","195945"
"8986","In fact, the title of this motion picture is quite apt -- Mimic does an excellent job of imitating not only Aliens, but several other science fiction and horror features, including such odd choices as Leviathan and The Thing. The derivative result is, as one might expect, moderately entertaining, but far from groundbreaking in its approach or execution.","63","119675"
"8987","The Saint is more of a character-based thriller than a strict stunts-and-explosions film, which is a good thing because the action sequences are mostly flat and obligatory. Even when he generates a degree of tension, director Phillip Noyce (Patriot Games, Clear and Present Danger) is unable to sustain it, and the disappointing ending is not only long and drawn out, but lacks a sense of closure.","63","120053"
"8988","The film has too much surface beauty not to earn it a recommendation, but Days of Heaven satisfies only on a sensory level.","63","77405"
"8989","Overall, it's a gently bittersweet and affecting portrait.","63","1403981"
"8990","The final minute of Halloween 4 remains as unsettling today as it was during its 1988 theatrical run. The real reason to see this movie is not for the predictable build-up, but for the cliffhanger provided by director Dwight H. Little and screenwriter Alan B. McElroy.","63","95271"
"8991","As with Pakula's earlier suspenser, Klute, the eerie ambience of menace is coolly and smoothly handled, but for my taste the suspenseful set pieces go on much too long, and the message—that right-wing conspiracy is built into the American political and corporate structure—is overstated.","63","71970"
"8992","There's solid chemistry between Cruise and the stunning Newton, a superb actress previously restricted to such ethnic roles as Sally Hemings in ""Jefferson in Paris"" and the title role in ""Beloved.""","63","120755"
"8993","Armando Iannucci satirizes the manner in which political power is accorded to those who can mask cutthroat ambition behind an outward projection of bland inoffensiveness.","63","4686844"
"8994","It doesn't take a genius IQ to figure out the movie's final twist far in advance, leaving the attentive viewer to wonder only about how Shyamalan will pull it off and to hope the movie doesn't turn silly.","63","368447"
"8995","The Devil's Advocate is a dull morality tale, but a number of bright moments come courtesy of the Prince of Darkness.","63","118971"
"8996","Smith’s appeal, just, holds together a thin plot upon which Bennett, who wrote the script, and director Nicholas Hytner have loaded gimmicks.","63","3722070"
"8997","Enjoyable in a shallow way, but there's nothing so special here that it warrants more than a cursory glance.","63","117802"
"8998","Despite the pace, though -- pedal, have you met my friend metal? -- Ninja Assassin still has some of its best stuff left at the end, when the master returns to demonstrate his extra-special, super-most-deadliest technique.","63","1186367"
"8999","A well-paced action film in the vein of ""Speed.""","63","337921"
"9000","As a realistic horror movie, Misery is effective. If you like Stephen King books, you will probably like Misery. However, I kept hoping that Reiner and Goldman would do more with the material. [30 Nov 1990, p.3F]","63","100157"
"9001","Mike Nichols may never direct another ground-breaking movie, but even with bit performers he is still Mike Midas. Leads and lesser players alike have pointed things to say in this solid, not great, entertainment; if you think this is a movie for you - it probably is. [12 Sep 1990, p.1D]","63","100395"
"9002","There are times when Troy is stirring and engaging. However, at least as often, it is flat.","63","332452"
"9003","This sequel succeeds as a slightly convoluted, paint-by-the-numbers buddy/action comedy with fast, funny banter and well-choreographed fight scenes.","63","266915"
"9004","Robocop isn't going to win Verhoeven any medals - the focus remains on action, guns and gore - but it's a flashy movie with enough wit to be more than just another dumb bucket of bolts. [17 Jul 1987]","63","93870"
"9005","If the movie crumbles under its own stiffness at times, at least it has the two old pros' good performances to cheer us along the way.","63","119280"
"9006","It's all pulled off with a firm sense of the fun in being scared.","63","389722"
"9007","Cloak and Dagger does have its charms. It also has its tense moments, and an unforced sentimentality that helps it end on just the right note. And it's nicely performed. [10 Aug 1985, p.6]","63","87065"
"9008","I enjoyed a lot of the movie in a relaxed sort of fashion; it's not essential or original in the way ""The Truman Show'' was, and it hasn't done any really hard thinking about the ways we interact with TV.","63","131369"
"9009","Great dragon, dumb script. And pity the poor actors who have to deal with that situation. [31 May 1996]","63","116136"
"9010","The visions are grim, grisly and graphic, although actual hair-raising moments are rare — a chase here, a narrow escape there. Director Andy Muschietti (“Mama”) keeps the violence lurid and shocking, interrupted by moments of often-profane gallow’s humor.","63","1396484"
"9011","If it doesn't quite represent the new, improved Adam Sandler, it shows him almost desperately trying to figure out who that might be.","63","389860"
"9012","The film suggests that Bill and Ted’s dreams of stardom, which have evolved into dreams of acceptance and expression, aren’t so stupid after all.","63","1086064"
"9013","Though Bonnie And Clyde may have been conceived as a proto-European hybrid and The Graduate a California thoroughbred, the violent hemorrhage that closes the Depression-era/Vietnam-era touchstone makes as good a case as anything in filmed entertainment that American mass media operates in the declarative.","63","61418"
"9014","Lopez is not yet the actor Caviezel is. Still, she fills her performance with conviction, does a couple of her own stunts, and has enough star presence to fill the big screen.","63","225071"
"9015","This film based on Alan Glynn's novel ""Dark Fields"" is entirely too reliant on voice-over, a bit too tarted-up by Burger in an effort to make this head trip a visual experience.","63","1219289"
"9016","Joker reveals itself as very expensive cosplay: effective at first glance, but at its seams superficial, disposable and dishonest.","63","7286456"
"9017","Despite its all-around good performances (Pomeranc in particular is a marvel), Searching for Bobby Fischer can't quite shake its overly familiar feel. We've seen this all before, many times. It's a diverting, undemanding piece of work though, and you don't have to know a single thing about chess to enjoy it. [11 Aug 1993, p.E3]","63","108065"
"9018","This movie’s sole purpose is to make teenage boys high-five each other, and it’s faithfulness to that concept makes the cartoon carnage almost endearing.","63","1046173"
"9019","The sex is explicit and frequent and pretty much covers the spectrum. The drug use that accompanies it cringe-worthy. No man could have ever gotten away with adapting Phoebe Gloeckner’s novel in such frank terms.","63","3172532"
"9020","Feels jumbled and disorganized. It's not altogether unpalatable, but that doesn't present it from being a mess.","63","455538"
"9021","Ultimately, the plot (irrespective of how faithful it is to real life) isn't the problem - it's the unevenness with which co-directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa (both making their directorial debuts) approach it that limits the film's success and mutes the experience of sitting through it.","63","1045772"
"9022","Good as Lucas Hedges is at acting the tortured teen, Jared is finally too much of a cipher for his story to really hit with the force that it should.","63","7008872"
"9023","The film is home to some unique redeeming factors, but it panders to viewers by diluting its lesson, which teaches that some comfort zones can only be truly abandoned on the other side of the world.","63","1412386"
"9024","The concert scenes in this biographical picture are some of its best moments — you’ll wonder just how long the actor had to practice to perfect all those splits — and Boseman’s charisma is irresistible.","63","2473602"
"9025","The four leading actresses give memorable portrayals, all worth watching. The message, of the universal necessity of love and human kindness, is certainly important. But as a total movie experience, Fried Green Tomatoes gives way to sentimentality and calculated tear-jerking. [28 Jan 1992, p.4D]","63","101921"
"9026","Amelia goes airborne but never fully soars.","63","1129445"
"9027","This being Irving, the story straddles the sweet and the creepy.","63","124315"
"9028","Serial Mom is a typically funny and cheerfully outrageous John Waters' comedy about the conjunction of suburbia and hell, perfect families and serial killers. [15 Apr 1994, p.C]","63","111127"
"9029","The gleeful teen-horror spoof that proves that the Farrelly brothers have no monopoly on outrageous, politically incorrect comedy.","63","175142"
"9030","Besson’s script may let her (and Freeman) down in the third act, but the 89 minute long Lucy is so brisk it’ll give you whiplash. Even marginal thrillers benefit from a director and star who have a sense of urgency and are as hellbent as this on not overstaying their welcome.","63","2872732"
"9031","Most of the film is dull and soporific. Breathtaking photography without emotional involvement can take an audience only so far.","63","119485"
"9032","Because it is light and stylish and good-hearted, it is quite possible to enjoy, in the right frame of mind. This is more of a movie to see on video, on an empty night when you need something to hurl at the gloom.","63","117104"
"9033","This long-awaited movie has been unwisely chopped into two pieces -- the second is due in February -- when it really needed to be one long, delirious ride.","63","266697"
"9034","All it lacks are the crucial things an inspired director could have provided: spark, soul and magic.","63","241527"
"9035","Perhaps with a few more drafts, the filmmakers could have found a means of maintaining the quiet momentum displayed early on, but as it stands, Changeling is little more than a frustrating missed opportunity that's dressed to the nines, but a day late for the party.","63","824747"
"9036","The Song of Names is a more interesting than fascinating mystery than it is a profound statement on memory, loss, tragedy and faith — which was plainly its aim. The conflict is more talked about than keenly felt, the climax something of an over-the-top anti-climax.","63","1657517"
"9037","So laden with forced plot twists that it will never be able to recover.","63","174480"
"9038","What makes The Rover more watchable than the average self-conscious genre exercise is Pearce, who exudes such weary authority and palpable vulnerability that he’s sympathetic even in the film’s most brutalizing moments.","63","2345737"
"9039","The Fifth Estate is stuck running in place.","63","1837703"
"9040","Eccentric enough to get mistaken for an uplifting fantasy, but it's Plaza who belongs in the penthouse.","63","1862079"
"9041","All told, there's an ageless warmth to The LEGO Movie akin to that of the LEGO brand itself.","63","1490017"
"9042","As the plot loses steam, director Mark Pellington (whose paranoid thriller ""Arlington Road"" was one of the worst movies of 1999) tends to rely on cheap tricks to maintain suspense, although the final catastrophe is very nicely done.","63","265349"
"9043","There is a lot of shield-your-eyes ickiness in District 9, a lot of violence and gore. What there is not a lot of, however, is humanity - even in the film's depiction of the inhumanity humans are capable of.","63","1136608"
"9044","Rocky Balboa scores a split decision: A familiar start, some flat-footed middle rounds and a solid, flailing finish. And since Stallone has promised to throw in the towel on the franchise, we'll add an extra half star in honour of his diligence in the gym.","63","479143"
"9045","Judy and Nick’s unlikely-buddies routine is amusing, but their exploits and interplay occasionally neglect the youngest demographic.","63","2948356"
"9046","A serious movie made by seriously talented people, and I never quite came 'round to it.","63","285742"
"9047","The film is all very wistful, and at its best moments has an exquisite mystery to it, the lure of the memory play. And even when it isn't working, there's Turner to watch. That's something. [10 Oct 1986, p.D1]","63","91738"
"9048","Perhaps a better name for Marc Abraham’s well-crafted biopic would be His Cheatin’ Heart, for this motion picture concentrates on the marital distress between a philandering Williams and his flat-singing wife (played with vibrancy by Elizabeth Olsen).","63","1490785"
"9049","Horror fans will still find it worthwhile. The ending is also a nice twist on the slasher genre.","63","263488"
"9050","The strongest parts of the film aren't these money shots, but the buildup to the gunplay.","63","257076"
"9051","The movie devolves into a kind of high-tech Flash Gordon, with Ra as a cross- dressed Ming and Russell and Spader as the heroes required to chase big lugs with ray-guns around the inside of a pyramid. Things get pretty brainless before it's over, although Russell does get to deliver a great send-off line. [28 Oct 1994, p.5]","63","111282"
"9052","It goes down as smoothly as a milkshake thanks to an impressive cast.","63","1189340"
"9053","The tagline for the film reads ""You Don't Become a Hero by Being Normal,"" and the film mostly lives up to that assertion, but only up to a point.","63","1623288"
"9054","For all its lazy beauty, the movie is rooted in the personalities of its lead characters and they, unfortunately, are bloodless, affectless, emotionless dopes who turn their considerable lack of scruples on the business of senseless killing, for which they seemingly have no remorse. [13 Feb. 1998]","63","69762"
"9055","At its best, The Tree of Life makes the viewer lean forward, eager to enter Malick's own dreamy, poetic consciousness. At worst, it leads to the vague feeling that we're listening to the meanderings of someone who's not sure we're smart enough to keep up.","63","478304"
"9056","A few genuinely (and literally) hair-raising moments, a few knowing winks and a lot to think about lift It Follows above the horror pack.","63","3235888"
"9057","It combines elements of ""Lord of the Rings,"" ""Star Wars"" and James Bond flicks with generically satisfying results.","63","253754"
"9058","In their formidable quest for junk food, Harold and Kumar end up redefining what the all-American protagonists of Hollywood movies should look like - and prove this comedy is not quite as brain-dead as it originally appeared.","63","366551"
"9059","At least there's Cage, who has become an astute voice actor, finding some odd, clever, energetic line readings consistently fresher than The Croods itself.","63","481499"
"9060","Of Course A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors is repulsive. That is its primary attraction. All right-thinking people will steer clear. But wrong-thinkers with a taste for the grotesque will be in heaven, or the nearest satanic equivalent. [27 Feb 1987]","63","93629"
"9061","A contemplative fable, Honeydripper locates the moment but misses the heart-pounding, gut-wrenching explosion -- the history is there, the thrill isn't.","63","829193"
"9062","The problem with Beasts of the Southern Wild is that, like ""The Tree of Life,"" it seeks to integrate its small, very personal story into a much larger, more ambitious tapestry.","63","2125435"
"9063","Most of its strength emerges from a well-directed ensemble, one able to convey the high concept of a nightmarish situation without losing their relatable humanity.","63","2737304"
"9064","Those who still relish the sight of Anthony Hopkins portraying an evil criminal mastermind will get the most out of Fracture, which is not so much a whodunit -- we see Hopkins' character putting a bullet in his wife's head in the movie's first few minutes -- as a howdunnit.","63","488120"
"9065","[Boyle] shrugs off any intellectual pretense to rollick in a dead-on scare fest. On that level, 28 Days Later is indeed a frightfully good time.","63","289043"
"9066","This is a wonderful formula. I love it. The Poseidon Adventure is the kind of movie you know is going to be awful, and yet somehow you gotta see it, right?","63","69113"
"9067","Jackman and McGregor are a delight to watch.","63","800240"
"9068","Flashy, fun, shallow, easy-going and without a hope of brilliance.","63","420609"
"9069","The content is eminently forgettable but the thing has definitely got style.","63","118548"
"9070","Despite the clever premise and several laugh-aloud moments, the film as a whole underwhelms.","63","1155056"
"9071","If a film can essentially succeed while also remaining essentially frustrating, here's a prime example.","63","1596363"
"9072","“Serviceable,” the stinging critique of a young man’s potential by his publisher/father, fits.","63","460890"
"9073","Perhaps this multilingual, almost-pre-AIDS idyll does not stretch credulity – the family is surely based on Aciman’s own internationalist clan – but it can try the patience.","63","5726616"
"9074","The movie is often tremendously exciting.","63","102138"
"9075","Superficially gritty yet soullessly slick melodrama.","63","183649"
"9076","Hard Candy is the rare movie that may be worthiest for the arguments you'll have after it's over.","63","424136"
"9077","The scenery is glorious; you can almost feel the sunshine and smell the wine. But Crowe and Scott are bulls in Mayle's china shop. Like an assertive Burgundy served with a delicate fish, they're a classic wrong pairing.","63","401445"
"9078","Funny moments can be found throughout, but it's mostly silly and scattered.","63","366548"
"9079","Also, it is almost squeaky clean. It's rated PG, but without about four seconds of toilet humor and five seconds of bra ogling, Bill and Ted might have faced an insurmountable challenge: the dreaded G rating. [20 Feb 1989, p.D06]","63","96928"
"9080","Eisenberg, perfectly, pliably put upon, is the engine that drives thispicture.","63","1825157"
"9081","If you go, be sure to stick around through the closing credits. By far the funniest part of the movie is a blackly humorous fantasy sequence starring Merchant.","63","480687"
"9082","Nice to look at but too calculated and clichéd to resonate beyond its surface slickness.","63","230838"
"9083","An amazing physical specimen, beautifully photographed and edited. If you think of it as your own opium dream, you may dismiss the lousy story as a mere side effect.","63","120681"
"9084","With all of its oversights and indulgences, 25th Hour is still a persuasive, undeniably fascinating film—watching Lee throw everything on his mind into the fray, no matter how irreconcilable with the story, makes for an interesting experience.","63","307901"
"9085","Beyond the tunes, however, Elizabethtown falls short of actual emotional resonance, and is really nothing more than a passable ""Garden State"" doppelgänger.","63","368709"
"9086","This fifth film should please fans who rate the films based on their fidelity to the canonical texts. But for the uninitiated, it's a dry and slightly dreary introduction to the world of Hogwarts and Azkaban.","63","373889"
"9087","Given the film's early promise, it's unfortunate how it turns into a largely reductive Freudian character piece in which the main character has to come to terms with his old man.","63","1714206"
"9088","Preposterous, luridly entertaining.","63","493464"
"9089","Employs superb craftsmanship and a powerful Denzel Washington performance in an attempt to elevate genre material above its natural level, but it fails. The underlying story isn't worth the effort.","63","328107"
"9090","The payoff isn't worth the time invested, but at least the actor-turned-filmmaker underplays an inherently queasy project that could have been over the top.","63","264616"
"9091","Ramin Bahrani's talent for orchestrating sequences of tightly wound tension is in full bloom here, as is his complementary knack for quieter grace notes.","63","2891174"
"9092","A carnival geek show elevated in the direction of art. It never quite gets there, but it tries with every fiber of its craft to redeem its pulp origins, and we must give it credit for the courage of its depravity.","63","212985"
"9093","We can enjoy the suspense of the opening scenes, and some of the drama. The performances are in keeping with the material. But toward the end, when we realize that the entire reality of the film is problematical, there is a certain impatience. It's as if our chain is being yanked.","63","838247"
"9094","While qualifying as the most gorgeously appointed and finely detailed version of the novel so far, still lacks the element of essential fire to make it come fully, even subversively, to life.","63","1229822"
"9095","Though the filmmakers may not believe in a higher power, they still maintain a faith in raunchiness as an id-blasting form of liberation from rigid norms, spiritual, sexual, or otherwise.","63","1700841"
"9096","Director Robbins is a natural - he has managed to make a movie that is entertaining despite the handicap of having a main character who is at best a black hole. [30 June 1981]","63","82288"
"9097","At its best, The Last Station vividly illustrates the enduring Russian gift for iconography, whether spiritual, secular or something in between.","63","824758"
"9098","Because De Niro's performance is aptly ''Scorsese-aggressive'' while Crystal effectively underplays, one can easily sit through this bottom-line disappointment with a smile painted on, waiting for belly laughs that rarely come. [5 Mar 1999]","63","122933"
"9099","The best one can say is that it's a smart cartoon, and a fairly exhausting viewing experience.","63","120735"
"9100","The movie’s a piece of high-octane summer piffle: stylish, funny, brainless without being too obnoxious about it, and Cruise is its manic animating principle.","63","1013743"
"9101","It's no Runaway success, but Gere and Roberts still glow.","63","163187"
"9102","Peter Berg's fast-talking and unnecessarily complicated tale of Middle East terrorism is more smoke and mirrors than meat. It may come on like Syriana, but it boils down to little more than a diverting episode of ""CSI: Riyadh.""","63","431197"
"9103","Despite its lapses in credibility, the screenplay does offer both wit and numerous surprise twists, as well as all that non-stop action. And it's a nice change to see an action movie in which the hero, Russell's Grant, isn't some muscle-bound squinter. [15 Mar 1996]","63","116253"
"9104","Armageddon is a testosterone and adrenaline cocktail, with almost no intelligence added for flavoring.","63","120591"
"9105","It has a certain commitment to its cause, and by that I mean it supplies the necessary flayings, slayings, beheadings and, um, a be-nose-ing, all of it dancing to the tune of those amusingly stilted He-Man declaratives - King James Bible cadences applied to comic-book visions. It knows it's a B movie, and gets on with it.","63","816462"
"9106","This is well-crafted retro horror, too familiar to be really scary but smart enough to be fun. And funny too, with the kind of pure laughs that grow organically from the script, untainted by the chemical spray of irony.","63","439815"
"9107","It does well in using dialogue to shape its escalating tête-à-tête, but the filmmaking is too fuzzy to expand on those ideas.","63","3416744"
"9108","Despite Aniston's hard work, Good Girl could be better.","63","279113"
"9109","The movie feels torn between styles and intentions. It’s trippier than “Ex Machina,” and Garland makes a valiant go of its concerns, but Annihilation feels like a short-story amount of story pulled and twisted into feature length.","63","2798920"
"9110","These are women who seemed raised on Louisa May Alcott and might have been aspirationally besotted with Jane Austen. But you sense tragedy looming. They're hurtling, inexorably, toward Tennessee Williams.","63","1667307"
"9111","We're left with the weakest part of the novel -- the lurching and often melodramatic plot -- plus the chance to see two splendid actors, Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett, do the best they can with what they're given (sadly, in Blanchett's case, not much). Okay, no one would call that trade-off a scandal, but it sure ain't much of a bargain.","63","465551"
"9112","Law owns every scene he’s in--which is literally all of them--plus a decent supporting cast and dapper dialogue truly make for a breezy good time.","63","375173"
"9113","Tomb Raider is an often fun and visually compelling action pic, that is also sometimes unintentionally silly, with a great actress leading the whole thing.","63","1365519"
"9114","The film remains relatively entertaining, simply because the scenario hits so close to home, no matter where you work.","63","1172991"
"9115","A satire whose dead aim stops wounding - and starts making - stereotypes of white middle-classness.","63","169547"
"9116","This is the kind of movie in which a dozen bad guys with an automatic weapon in each hand couldn't hit a lake if they were standing at the bottom of it, to steal the screenplay's best wiseacre remark.","63","116908"
"9117","At 120 minutes, The Love Witch is too long. Biller has too much material on her hands and too many non sequitur scenes.","63","3908142"
"9118","This sweet, affectionate (and unapologetically slight) comedy is an all-too-rare homage to harmless, hilarious incompetence, at a time when there is plenty of the more hurtful kind to go around. If it isn’t quite up to the standards of “Ed Wood,” Tim Burton’s 1994 tribute to the auteur of such misbegotten fruits of moviemaking as “Plan 9 From Outer Space,” it is nonetheless a much-needed distraction.","63","3521126"
"9119","Happy End, for its part, signals a return to form for the director, who here makes a stark departure from the sweet tone of “Amour” — perhaps his most mainstream work — in favor of the vinegary outlook on life manifested in such films as “Funny Games,” his 2007 horror movie about violently psychopathic home invaders, and “The White Ribbon,” his 2009 pre-World War I period piece about, among other things, child abuse.","63","5304464"
"9120","Unfortunately, it lacks emotional lift or folkloric fervor.","63","217505"
"9121","Has an unerring capacity for going soft whenever a hard edge is called for.","63","241303"
"9122","So what is Bridesmaids? A boozy wedding comedy? A touching character story? A paean to friendship? At turns, it's each -- making it a wedding movie with a commitment problem and giving Feig's scattered film a rudderless quality between the laugh lines.","63","1478338"
"9123","Although far from the worst offender in Disney's canon, The Lion King is nevertheless host to many of the less savory qualities common to the studio's output.","63","110357"
"9124","The result is a war picture that, trying to pass off fidelity to the book as objectivity, sacrifices any voice of its own, and ends up not knowing what to think.","63","418763"
"9125","Whether it's any good depends on your expectations.","63","120910"
"9126","Things move fast enough to make it a movie to enjoy and then forget.","63","258000"
"9127","It is an accepted truth that adapting a sublime novel does not always result in a sublime movie. To an extent, this is the problem with Never Let Me Go.","63","1334260"
"9128","When Vantage Point is staying with Quaid and Fox as they hunt the suspected assassins (including the arrestingly beautiful Israeli actress Ayelet Zurer) it's a perfectly serviceable thriller with high production values and some better-than-average car chases.","63","443274"
"9129","The story's more sober elements are regularly leavened by hip visual flourishes and even some quiet comedy.","63","151137"
"9130","It’s very much a film about men, their yearnings and discontents, and about the way sins tumble down from one generation to the next. It’s a bank-robber movie, too, as well as a drama about the pressures teenagers face from parents and peers. You can feel Cianfrance biting off more and more until his mouth is too full to chew.","63","1817273"
"9131","At least the movie Pirates of the Caribbean is fun -- but only as long as you don't expect much. Take it from me: The ride is better.","63","325980"
"9132","When it comes to memorable personalities, humans and aliens alike take a backseat to Fassbender, who is magnificent in his dual robotic roles.","63","2316204"
"9133","Detroit Rock City possesses three characteristics: an irreverent attitude, a high energy approach, and a loud soundtrack. While these qualities don't necessarily add up to a good movie, they keep the proceedings from becoming dull.","63","165710"
"9134","Unfortunately, the parts of the movie that are truly good are buried beneath the deadening layers of thriller cliches and an unconvincing love story.","63","118883"
"9135","The best moments in Matchstick Men belong to Cage and Lohman, who, in ""Paper Moon"" fashion, prove that the family that cons together, laughs together.","63","325805"
"9136","You don't have to believe in far-fetched tales of mysterious beams of light and alien abductions to get caught up in The Fourth Kind.","63","1220198"
"9137","Despite some great acting, Film Stars Don’t Die in Liverpool is a largely unpleasant viewing experience and the downbeat tone isn’t helped by a narrative that flits back and forth in time without rhyme or reason, sometimes confusing the viewer with the needlessly convoluted transitions from flashback to present (and vice versa).","63","5711148"
"9138","The downside is that ""The Hobbit"" no longer looks like a movie at all. It looks like a video.","63","903624"
"9139","Amid this conundrum of a movie, the actors provide what the facile screenplay cannot: a human pulse, shrewdly underscored by composer Alexandre Desplat’s time-traveling musical landscape.","63","4971344"
"9140","The movie is broad and clumsy, and the dialogue cannot be described as witty, but a kind of grandeur creeps into the screenplay by Ted Griffin and Jeff Nathanson.","63","471042"
"9141","Its ideas are paralleled, its themes twinned, sometimes breathlessly, sometimes fatuously, into what may be described as a 164-minute pop song of seemingly infinite verses, choruses, and bridges. Perhaps expectedly, it soars as often as it thuds.","63","1371111"
"9142","On most levels his performance is as flat as his abs: very early Wahlberg.","63","430308"
"9143","The new remake has several strikes against it: self-indulgent dialogue, uneven performances, stupid shock effects, and a paranoid view of space exploration. It's also about 20 minutes too long. Yet it packs a strong wallop about half the time, if you see it as a child's-eye-view story that taps directly into preteen fears and fantasies.","63","91276"
"9144","One of the irritations of Ghost is that the Moore character is such a slow study.","63","99653"
"9145","1492 is a pretty good movie, but it isn't as good as you might like. Part of the problem is Roselyne Bosch's script. The screenwriter (and co-producer) seems so determined to make a hero of Columbus that she can't resist giving him every virtue and virtuous motive available, and placing him in direct opposition to every bad guy or bad idea around, including decadent aristocrats, ignorant priests, and the Church and the Inquisition in general. [12 Oct 1992]","63","103594"
"9146","Baumbach is 45 (roughly the same age as Josh) so he writes from personal experience. He knows what these characters are feeling which is the reason why the human elements resonate with authenticity - a quality that fades when While We're Young wanders off on the tangent about what constitutes a legitimate documentary.","63","1791682"
"9147","There's not a dull moment in the thing, and it's dumb as dirt. But who can resist? It's the ultimate guilty pleasure, the kind of movie that in years to come, when they're chronicling the decline of our culture, will turn up as an exhibit. [23 Nov 1990, p.G5]","63","100403"
"9148","The movie Rendition asks, admittedly in a one-sided way, whether the ends justify these means.","63","804522"
"9149","With its good intentions and likable demeanor, The Electric Horseman is an engaging but minor movie. It makes another amiable and thoughtful vehicle for two of our most charismatic stars, while never quite entering the world of action and ideas that hover just beyond the horsey humor and tumbling tumbleweeds of the story.","63","79100"
"9150","The star is unstoppable and spectacular to see in motion. Watch her fly.","63","451279"
"9151","An uneven special effects extravaganza about a little boy who winds up traveling through world history along with five midgets. Together they meet and frustrate the great and the near-great. Including Napoleon, Robin Hood, and the devil. Unfortunately, there are just too many visits to famous people. The film was created by some of the people responsible for the Monty Python comedies. [25 Dec 1981, p.12]","63","81633"
"9152","For all the film's gritty verisimilitude, The Messenger is not the great Iraq War movie that Kathryn Bigelow's ""The Hurt Locker"" is.","63","790712"
"9153","The Witches of Eastwick is a diverting, impeccably polished and excellently cast movie. But its charms fade fast, about as fast as it takes to leave the theater. [12 June 1987, p.D1]","63","94332"
"9154","Unlike the game, Clue doesn't take murder seriously. Writer-director Jonathan Lynn has made a campy non-thriller rather than laying down the mystery and then having fun with it; the comedy kills the plot.","63","88930"
"9155","A diverting action fantasy that modernizes the stories of demigods and monsters.","63","814255"
"9156","Stretched to three hours, including a pointless (old fashioned) overture and intermission, does it live up to the “Cinema Event” Tarantino has hyped it as? Hell no. It’s just a minimalist Spaghetti Western suffering from auteur bloat — sometimes entertaining, with not even remotely enough story of action to support its insuperable length and gravitas.","63","3460252"
"9157","Lucky for us, Dench and Frears pick up the slack and turn slim pickings into a fun time at the movies. But Victoria & Abdul could have been oh so much more.","63","5816682"
"9158","While the rubber-limbed Carrey may not yet be in the hyper-manic league of Jerry Lewis or Robin Williams, his psychotic energy goes a long way to make this plot-anemic comedy palatable. [04Feb1994 Pg. 07.D]","63","109040"
"9159","Unfortunately, an A-list group of actors doesn't mean a lot when there isn't much of a script.","63","120647"
"9160","The “Transformers” hottie undergoes her very own transformation here, thanks to satanic possession.","63","1131734"
"9161","More spirit and grace and less blood and guts may be what Passion needs.","63","335345"
"9162","The problem is that the movie spends as much time on the boring detective chasing Lucas as on the drug lord himself.","63","765429"
"9163","It scares and shocks us because it's so cleverly made; the writer-director, David Cronenberg, uses invention and imagination to replace expensive shock effects.","63","73705"
"9164","If its heart-pounding romance doesn’t make you cry, its sorely needed sense of optimism will surely make you smile.","63","6423362"
"9165","A devilish little comedy whose urbane, satirical humor will probably sail right over the heads of audiences weaned on Scream.","63","142688"
"9166","The Corruptor is visually lively and filled with gratuitous destruction. [12 Mar 1999]","63","142192"
"9167","The central problem with Rise of the Planet of the Apes is that it feels more like a piece of something larger than a complete motion picture.","63","1318514"
"9168","Chris Rock's I Think I Love My Wife is less interesting, and less successful, as a remake of a much-bruited '70s art film than it is as a compendium of Rockian observations on the current state of the African-American bourgeoisie.","63","770772"
"9169","It’s an intense and sharp opening that would impress Spielberg, if he could hear the dang thing. Nearly the entire movie is torpedoed by its cranked-to-11 sound mix, with a good chunk of dialogue drowned out by whirring airplanes and myriad explosions.","63","4530422"
"9170","Ultimately, though, the movie's charms are frustrated by meandering direction.","63","120032"
"9171","The way that Dominika is at once completely transparent and at the same time impossible to read is Red Sparrow's most intriguing through line, not least of which for the way that Jennifer Lawrence makes you grasp the canny mental gymnastics that her character has to do in order for everything that she says to be at once truth and obfuscation.","63","2873282"
"9172","An atrocious movie. An offensively stupid movie. A movie so witless and so crammed with bathroom humour that you will be deeply thankful for the darkness that envelops you - it lets you hide the fact (disturbing as it is) that you do laugh at the antics of Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels, in spite of yourself.","63","109686"
"9173","Letters covers less emotional ground than its predecessor, because Eastwood and first-time writer Iris Yamashita (who shares a story credit with Paul Haggis) allow Japanese soldiers only three modes of behavior.","63","498380"
"9174","In the end, Shadow suffers from a kind of shallow narcissism. Yes, it’s beautiful. Sure, it’s hard to take your eyes off it, with all the slow-motion action, enhanced by an ever-present, photogenic drizzle. But in an ironic departure from the theme of the balance, it too often emphasizes style over substance.","63","6864046"
"9175","I found Contagion both flawed and fascinating, but it's not an entertainment.","63","1598778"
"9176","Isn't without charm, or laughs. Director Shawn Levy's film features some of the best child actor casting since ""The Little Rascals.""","63","349205"
"9177","Fast-paced and often witty, but ultimately vapid.","63","139239"
"9178","What tends to right Moonlight, even when Barry Jenkins's filmmaking drifts into indulgence, is the strength of its actors.","63","4975722"
"9179","Steve Jobs, which by many accounts plays loose with the facts, is at its weakest when it tries to humanize its protagonist.","63","2080374"
"9180","A daring movie in today's current climate - one likely to be remembered at year's end. [18 Oct 1989]","63","97240"
"9181","Scarface is a B- movie with singularly silly psychological pretensions: its neo-primitivism is to the complex moral cosmos of Francis Coppola's ""Godfather"" saga as Disney is to Dickens. [09 Dec 1983]","63","86250"
"9182","This is not a film in need of creativity, passion or energy; what it needed was restraint, consideration and direction. This is not saying that Birdman is awful, or a debacle; there are superb scenes here, as well as excellent performance moments, but they get drowned out in the flood of Iñárritu’s ambition, energy and fantasies.","63","2562232"
"9183","Though the journey ends on some fun notes after a sagging middle, Galaxy never fully breaks out.","63","371724"
"9184","The movie deals with narrative housekeeping. Perhaps the next one will engage these characters in a more challenging and devious story, one more about testing their personalities than re-establishing them. In the meantime, you want space opera, you got it.","63","796366"
"9185","As with Sicario, the broad strokes of the film's Southwestern stereotypes gradually sharpen into focus as the story pivots to a look at the systemic forces that shape the characters.","63","2582782"
"9186","For a movie of its type, Max Payne is a little short on excitement and heavy on pathos.","63","467197"
"9187","In most respects, The Iron Giant is one of the better animated children's films in recent memory, which makes its strident political correctness all the more frustrating.","63","129167"
"9188","Ritchie and company spend too much time being cute and not enough time being clever, resulting in a one-dimensional comic-book version of Doyle's detectives.","63","988045"
"9189","It's a reasonably efficient baby sitter, done up in 3-D computer-generated animation of no special distinction. But the first one's weird mixture of James Bond bombast and hyperactive pill-shaped Minions (the protagonist Gru's goggle-clad helpers) had the element of surprise in its favor.","63","1690953"
"9190","That it lacks the snap, crackle and kapow of the summer's better comic book blockbusters isn't surprising. With all this effort riding on a big, expensive and rushed studio summer picture, the real miracle is that any of them come to life.","63","409847"
"9191","At its most profound, Benjamin Button isn't about anything more important than Pitt's very handsomeness, which, for a surprising stretch of time, is a wonderful subject for study.","63","421715"
"9192","127 Hours never calms down. You suspect you're only getting half the truth of what this ordeal must've been like.","63","1542344"
"9193","Barker’s vision cribs equally from the mythos of vampires and zombies, but Hellraiser‘s overriding ridiculousness (and nagging budgetary shortcomings) can’t disguise the fact that the movie is at least unwittingly a product of the AIDS crisis.","63","93177"
"9194","While it’s technically eye-popping and intricately structured, Interstellar is at its most fascinating when it struggles hard to communicate those things we human beings call “emotions”. Instead, we get something like a freeze-dried approximation of Steven Spielberg at his most sentimental.","63","816692"
"9195","A Single Man is like a big coffee table book on grief, loneliness, and loss - and mid-20th-century home design.","63","1315981"
"9196","Often funny, always telling, this is the kind of not-quite-successful comedy that is fraught with not-quite-intentionalmeaning. From the pun in the title to the echoes in the script, Class is apop sociologist's dream. [22 July 1983]","63","85346"
"9197","The Meddler is a movie of modest charms.","63","4501454"
"9198","Notting Hill does an adequate job, but this isn't one of those landmark romantic comedies that dozens of subsequent movies will seek to emulate.","63","125439"
"9199","Kingsley gives the movie a jolt and blows the rest of it to pieces.","63","203119"
"9200","Spends too much time covering ground well known from the headlines. But the scenes of the couple at home with their children and friends are uniquely fascinating, if not, in Wilson's words, ""very 007-ish.""","63","977855"
"9201","The whiplash contrasts between snideness and sincerity is deeply rooted in the main character's psychology.","63","1431045"
"9202","The result is too much formula and not enough human interest.","63","1389137"
"9203","It's a solid, old-fashioned action yarn filled with the very latest dive gear and the oldest plot formula in the movie-maker's playbook.","63","881320"
"9204","Though it's not worth doing cartwheels over, Flipped is a pleasantly nostalgic and well-intentioned family movie featuring strong performances by its young actors.","63","817177"
"9205","As for the two leads, they have charm to spare, and it’s startling to see Hepburn bring bitterness to bear on her trademark wit, but the relationship and all its foibles still feel prescribed by the overall structure, not borne of real life.","63","62407"
"9206","An amiable crowd-pleaser, nothing more, nothing less. [27 Nov 1987]","63","94137"
"9207","If the script were half as witty as its production design and Danny Elfman's score, the film might be a classic; instead, it recalls the “Beetlejuice” half that doesn't have Keaton. [7 Dec 1990, Life, p.4D]","63","99487"
"9208","After a slow start, this feel-good family film is a nice postcard from the Big Apple that may benefit New York and the Museum of Natural History as much as it does 20th Century Fox.","63","477347"
"9209","It's a much better bad movie than the first one. It isn't often in Hollywood that a director gets the chance to go back and essentially remake a failed film but Lambert, refusing to let sleeping cadavers lie, gets the job done this time. [28 Aug 1992, p.50]","63","105128"
"9210","The movie is generally entertaining, if only because the three primary characters capture the audience's sympathy, but the story doesn't contain much honest drama.","63","112571"
"9211","It is done well, yet one is still surprised to find it done at all.","63","109045"
"9212","By movie's end, it seems like the only one giving a truly genuine performance is Bianca. Mouth-agape, steadfastly mum.","63","805564"
"9213","Marketed as a combination of a popcorn-munching actioner, but that's somewhat misleading -- it's also a well-researched historical thriller. Unfortunately, it ends up not succeeding as either.","63","985699"
"9214","Pedro Almodóvar’s object-oriented approach ends up blocking off the deeper emotional access that Alice Munro's stories so effortlessly attain.","63","4326444"
"9215","Like ""Man on Fire,"" the previous collaboration between Washington and Scott, Déjà Vu is stunning but poorly paced, a film that manages to be both captivating and frustrating.","63","453467"
"9216","Honorable, worthy and windy, Fences is essentially a PBS episode of “Great Performances” that is inflated for the big screen without ever quite belonging there.","63","2671706"
"9217","The Omen takes all of this terribly seriously, as befits the genre that gave us Rosemary’s Baby and The Exorcist. What Jesus was to the 1950s movie epic, the devil is to the 1970s, and so all of this material is approached with the greatest solemnity, not only in the performances but also in the photography, the music and the very looks on people's faces.","63","75005"
"9218","Genial but largely predictable ensemble comedy.","63","303714"
"9219","Dark, nasty fun that gets better when you play it over in your head. But the plot holes seem even larger in hindsight, too. Just tamp down those expectations, then tamp them down some more.","63","1179933"
"9220","Del Toro reminds us just how chilling bumping into the supernatural is supposed to be, just how stomach churning violence is and just how many shades of red blood shows us, from first spurt to crusty dust.","63","2554274"
"9221","The script pushes all the expected buttons at all the expected moments, leaving you wondering what could have been achieved with a more rigorous, unsentimental approach.","63","99077"

"9228","It would be possible to appreciate Shannon's fabulous work in Take Shelter far better if the filmmaker lost a quarter of the two-hour running time -- there are many overlong scenes that make this a needlessly tough sit.","63","1675192"
"9229","It's got enough going on to sustain five blockbuster thrillers. That is its blessing and its curse.","63","808151"
"9230","If there's one thing Avary gets right, it's the brutal use-or-be-used approach to interpersonal relations that Ellis laid out with numbing detail, and James Van Der Beek is down to the challenge as Sean Bateman: horndog, cokehead, ceramics major, and all-around jerk.","63","292644"
"9231","A fresh-slant Vietnam picture in which lead Tom Cruise achieves indisputable greatness, July is otherwise a ""more often than not'' achievement. But though it's as full of itself as Stone's watchably windy Talk Radio, the film's roundhouse punches propel you into remote Mike Tyson-land when they connect. [20 Dec 1989, p.1D]","63","96969"
"9232","It’s far from the disaster it could have been given the tonal tightrope it walks, but it’s also closer to a misfire than we all hoped it would be. Believe it or not, the “Hitler Comedy” plays it too safe.","63","2584384"
"9233","Although Watermelon Woman is at times rudimentary and slight, it's saved by its humor and its way of tweaking political correctness. [9 May 1997, p.C6]","63","118125"

"9240","It's one of the most beautifully unpleasant movies ever made - its reverse charge being that it is no fun at all.","63","180093"
"9241","A movie only a copyright lawyer could love. It strip-mines at least three Hitchcock classics - ""North by Northwest,"" ""The Wrong Man,"" and ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" - then commits unlawful assault on Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" just for the heck of it.","63","1059786"
"9242","A slow-moving but otherwise efficient Canadian B-movie that gives the audience what it came for: blood and guts (the title, coincidentally, of Lynch's previous film). It is similar but inferior to Carrie, Halloween and When a Stranger Calls; it is similar but superior to Friday the 13th. [17 Sep 1980]","63","81383"

"9247","Paul Haggis switches from the problem of racism to the problem of Iraq. The war is a better fit. None of the exasperating guilt on display in ""Crash"" has made it into In the Valley of Elah, a solidly made genre movie: the Army mystery.","63","478134"
"9248","Obviously, it wasn't the plot that has given Little Shop such a long life. In the case of this film, it's the music, the sets and the comic sketches that make this remake mostly successful. [19 Dec 1986, p.77]","63","91419"
"9249","Frisky, raunchy and frequently riotous.","63","261392"

"9254","Shailene Woodley, already a subtle and rangy actress, easily carries the film as Hazel.","63","2582846"
"9255","It runs a complicated bait and switch on its audience, passing ostensible exploitation fodder through a high-toned prestige filter.","63","2053425"
"9256","Feels different from most recovering-train-wreck stories. The movie is a tidy relaying of a messy situation involving two reasonably functional middle-class LA alcoholics, one of whom gets serious about cleaning up a lot sooner than the other.","63","2063781"
"9257","It ends with the corniest convention of all: an absurd mano-a-mano between good and evil.","63","172495"

"9264","It manifests a mounting sense of disillusionment, suggesting that the rodeo lifestyle many characters so unreservedly romanticize often leads to physical and psychological ruin.","63","6217608"
"9265","It's impossible not to shake the feeling that we've been here before, and the movie never does convince you that a return trip was entirely necessary.","63","120363"
"9266","Thoughtful, if predictable, movie: set against the Soweto Uprising of 1976 (but shot in and around Harare, Zimbabwe), the picture proffers two families, one white and headed by schoolteacher Ben du Toit (Donald Sutherland), the other black andheaded by Ben's gardener, Gordon Ngubene (Winston Ntshona). Both are devastated by apartheid, but to different degrees and for different reasons. [22 Sept 1989]","63","97243"
"9267","The dialogue isn't ridiculous, and sometimes it's witty: A cynical cop (Donnie Wahlberg) doesn't buy Jamie's theory that the doll had something to do with the murder: ""The mystery toy department is down the hall. This is the homicide department.""","63","455760"

"9276","It comes across as painfully politically correct, offering trite sermons on various ""hot-button"" issues (gun control and the greenhouse effect).

"9277","Sokurov, for all his accomplishment, is less a bold innovator than a raider of lost art.","63","318034"
"9278","The most galling thing about Transcendence, though, isn't its inability to get a handle on what, if anything, it wants to say about the enormous changes happening to the human race, it's the movie's ending, which seems calculated to reassure us that everything's going to be fine as long as the right people are in charge, especially if they're good looking.","63","2209764"

"9283","If you appreciated the first movie’s sweetness, then you’ll likely be charmed enough. Otherwise, you’ll find the oof-to-opa! ratio hasn’t changed.","63","3760922"
"9284","Based on the true-life graphic novel by John Backderf (who went to high school with Dahmer), the film ponders whether Dahmer was born a sick puppy or if his environment made him that way. It's a conundrum.","63","2291540"
"9285","At best, it’s a fairly enjoyable hate-watch of a farewell to DDL, charting the course of a twisted love affair between a real pill of a guy and a woman who inexplicably adores him.","63","5776858"
"9286","Towards the end, Holland's movie gets a little confused: the scary elements give way to too many gory effects. Still, Fright Night is a pleasant diversion. [19 Aug 1985]","63","89175"
"9287","It has a bouncy sense of lunacy, wearing its derivative junkiness on its sleeve with surprising lightness of authority.","63","2091935"
"9288","As its titular tyrants, Spacey, Aniston, and Farrell all revel in their over-the-top noxiousness, though the latter is mysteriously given short shrift even though his performance is far and way the most novel and gonzo.","63","1499658"
"9289","The fault isn't Clooney's alone. The Coen brothers contrive a few spectacularly funny bits and pieces but rarely get into a flow. Too often they mistake facetiousness for slapstick invention or wit, and they don't follow through on their best ideas.","63","138524"
"9290","Short, sweet-and-sour, and amusing rather than funny, Despicable Me can't help but be likable.","63","1323594"
"9291","It’s tempting to think of Molly’s Game in poker terms: Sorkin’s holding a queen, a king, and at least a couple of aces, but the tell is that he talks too much, and in the end you realize he’s bluffing.","63","4209788"
"9292","The film has a streamlined efficiency, but it feels like the work of a master who wants to please rather than probe.","63","3682448"
"9293","The movie is a commercial for Hugh Hefner that makes his magazine seem like ""Seventeen.""","63","852713"
"9294","What the film, based on books by Felt and John D. O'Connor, lacks in narrative drive it strives to make up for with psychological probing.","63","5175450"
"9295","The Jacket is a confused attempt at headiness that feels like a poor man's ""Memento.""","63","366627"
"9296","Possibly year's most immaculate-looking drivel, a prismatically shot whodunit abundant in red herrings, but lacking in moral contemplation.","63","1392214"
"9297","Christopher Nolan's ""Memento"" was a movie-lover's dream come true, a puzzle that was engaging both intellectually and emotionally. But his Inception is a wake-up call, a blaring reminder that cheap tricks can't compensate for personal investment.","63","1375666"
"9298","The filmmaking is shallow but assured, the star charisma thoughtful but undimmed. As for the character, I'd vote for Mike Morris. Actually, I wish I could.","63","1124035"
"9299","This new heist movie by the great thriller director John Frankenheimer flails around like its own dysfunctional gang of casino robbers.","63","184858"
"9300","For the moment, King has restored women to their rightful place in a genre that is nothing without them. But, sadly, that genre isn't romantic comedy. It's the chick flick.","63","1000774"
"9301","This sort of flick can be fun, and there are moments here when it is, when a suddenly shifting perspective tosses us for a dizzying loop. Then again, there's such a thing as too much fun and too many moments -- at over two hours, this particular game meanders on way past its welcome.","63","119174"
"9302","The real villain is a cowed and lazy citizenry. Meaning all of us. Disappointingly, V for Vendetta makes this point early and moves on, at some point turning as shallow as what it protests against.","63","434409"
"9303","For a swoon-fest aimed at tweens, 17 Again has a lot going for it.","63","974661"
"9304","It recognizes that the thinly veiled secret of Wolverine’s loner act is that he’s always been a cog of some kind.","63","3315342"
"9305","While director Roland Emmerich (Independence Day) piles on outlandish scenarios, the chemistry of the lead actors mitigates the contrived setup and numbing explosions.","63","2334879"

"9307","Even if the obligatory third-act twist arrives with all the subtlety of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, Drag Me to Hell otherwise steers mostly clear of predictability.","63","1127180"
"9308","One wishes producer Spike Lee had stepped in to give the dialogue some sass.","63","199725"
"9309","The most striking aspect of Mud is the air of myth and tall-tale telling that hovers lightly over the settings and characters.","63","1935179"
"9310","There are plenty of strong performances, and LaBeouf does a nice job of becoming the tough-skinned pragmatist. Mulligan is as earnest as ever, and Susan Sarandon and, particularly, Frank Langella make strong cameos.","63","1027718"
"9311","Constant is the very thing The Constant Gardener is not. Attractive yet fickle, the movie beckons enticingly one moment and wanders off the next.","63","387131"
"9312","The computer animation of the monsters here is a herky-jerky cartoon blur that is anything but scary.","63","118604"
"9313","A lurching, addlebrained biopic that lacks even the crackpot energy of JFK, Oliver Stone's Nixon struggles to invest its nakedly venal subject with tragic dignity.","63","113987"

"9316","Surely a life sentence goes by quicker.","63","120689"
"9317","A combination of muddy sound mix and players with heavy accents (particularly Chinese superstar Gong, who seems to have learned her lines phonetically) renders large swaths of dialogue incomprehensible, but the details of what's being said and done don't really matter.","63","430357"
"9318","Takes its viewers on a bouncing high-wire act between intense violence and sugar-sweet tenderness, with some light-hearted comedy along the way.","63","110413"

"9326","It’s not bad, a solid “Hollywood” history of the 1830s Nat Turner slave revolt in Virginia with a love story, religion, injustices, torture and murder, a movie with middling, un-affecting acting but high artistic pretensions.","63","4196450"
"9327","The Front Runner is a less a film for general movie-goers than for political junkies.","63","7074886"
"9328","Seen from any chronological vantage, this isn't a superior flick - think of it more as great radio with average pictures. [16 Nov 1990]","63","100477"
"9329","Surrogates is entertaining and ingenious, but it settles too soon for formula.","63","986263"
"9330","For those who like their spoofs silly and their cartoonish gore vivid, Shaun offers some amusement.","63","365748"
"9331","This only mildly bloated and convoluted action comedy has enough inspired moments to wipe out memories of the abysmal 2002 first sequel as surely as one of the black-suited heroes' neutralizer.","63","1409024"
"9332","Taken as low comedy, Army of Darkness is fairly successful. The violence, although there is plenty of it, seems even more cartoonish and less gory than in the earlier movies. I have a feeling boys of about 11 or 12, with their normal penchant for bad puns and gross-out tactics, would be the most likely audience for this silliness, which often has the feel of an old ""Tales From the Crypt"" comic book. [19 Feb 1993, p.3G]","63","106308"
"9333","A surprisingly entertaining movie on its own, a strap-yourself-in, suspend-your-disbelief summer popcorn adventure.","63","473075"
"9334","Parts of the film are flatly directed...It certainly keeps the audience guessing, though, and few movies explode so many stereotypes. [31 Dec 1992]","63","104036"
"9335","Anything, Steven, anything would be better than making us watch the same movie again.","63","163025"
"9336","Dreamworks hired the directors of ""Lilo & Stitch"" to turn Cressida Cowell’s romp of a novel into an animated film and can’t be too surprised that they made, in essence, ""Hiccup and Stitch.""","63","892769"
"9337","The film preaches resolutely to the choir, and cinephiles in sync with the film's politics may still blanch at how snugly their interests are courted.","63","1706620"
"9338","All this is initially fascinating, and then progressively less so. The problem is the usual serial-killer issue – things, no matter how weird and kinky, get repetitive.","63","1441395"
"9339","There are two movies in Jackie, Pablo Larraín's film about Jackie Kennedy (Natalie Portman) immediately before, during and after the assassination of her husband, President John F. Kennedy. One of these movies is just OK. The other is exceptional. The first one keeps undermining the second.","63","1619029"
"9340","Sometimes Crazy, Stupid, Love captures the complexity, humor and sweetness of relationships. But in several scenes, the film takes that insight and replaces it with farcical coincidences and strained scenarios that undercut the poignancy and wit.","63","1570728"
"9341","The first half of Home Alone features the sugar-coated sentimentality that can usually be found in a Hughes film, while the second half is full of unanticipated sadism.","63","99785"
"9342","The original “Mary Poppins” was exuberant, fueled by terrific Sherman brothers songs. Mary Poppins Returns is often just pushy.","63","5028340"
"9343","A mixed bag of dumb jokes and unspeakable violence that is a big improvement over his (McDonagh) other work (it towers over Seven Psychopaths, which was one of the worst movies ever made) but not good enough to write home about at today’s inflated postal rates.","63","5027774"
"9344","The fragmented style is distracting and ultimately annoying, robbing the story of its suspense and drive while contributing nothing except self-conscious style.","63","315733"
"9345","A better film would have had the gumption to maintain the poetic bleakness, rather than steer toward what ultimately feels like safe compromise.","63","1967545"
"9346","National Treasure even has a rough time approaching the heart of ''The Amazing Race,"" a show that manages, in 44 minutes, to make you care about average folks as they follow clues across the globe.","63","368891"
"9347","There may be little point in deploring Blade Runner's lack of entertainment value. The production values, a reported $30 million worth, are nearly the whole show. They are impressive, to be sure. [26 June 1982, p.D6]","63","83658"
"9348","Lost Highway is unusually bizarre even for this atypical director. Co-written by Barry Gifford, the film ventures deeper into the nearly psychotic supernatural than any feature Lynch has previous overseen.","63","116922"
"9349","One roots for Lucas to get the next film sorted out, and to resurrect the humanity and soul that first made so many fall in love a long time ago with that galaxy far, far away.","63","121765"

"9353","If you enjoyed previous Simon comedies like Plaza Suite, it is virtually guaranteed that you will enjoy Goodbye Girl. If you have not previously enjoyed Simon's work, Goodbye Girl will not convert you. [21 Dec 1977]","63","76095"
"9354","For those who enjoy the non sequiturs common to Cheech & Chong comedies and Raymond Chandler mysteries, The Big Lebowski is a hoot. For those of a more serious warp, the film is a lexicon of postmodernism, a textbook example of recontextualizing earlier styles, what with its '60s casualties driving '70s cars and enjoying '50s pleasures in the '90s. In other words, this is not a movie for those who demand narrative thrust and coherence, although even they will be startled by the contrast between Bridges' teddy-bear affability and Goodman's corrosive hostility. [6 March 1998, p.04]","63","118715"
"9355","Escape from New York isn't really science fiction -- it's an action flick set in a futuristic setting. Epic potential for a masterful, gripping tale is abandoned in favor of cheap thrills.","63","82340"
"9356","Despite Allen's sincere face; Bridges' quirky, effective portrayal; some exquisite effects; and many funny moments, the film falters at the finish, if not a little before. Mostly it never delivers what it promises -- an alien with all the right answers. [14 Dec 1984, p.31]","63","88172"
"9357","It’s a scruffy little movie that doesn’t stand up to scrutiny or over-thinking — at all. But its charm carries it a long way.","63","4364194"
"9358","Win Win is a paragon of truth at a slow jog, but that upbeat sprint to the finish feels like a big cheat.","63","1606392"

"9361","It would have taken another director (the late David Lean, for instance) and a better script to make this movie into the serious, full-blooded epic it wants to be. But Power of One succeeds in entertaining and getting audiences to think about the tragedy of apartheid; flaws and all, it's still worth seeing. [31 March 1992, p.E6]","63","105159"
"9362","If Seven Psychopaths smacks a bit showoff-y in places, it's only because Martin McDonagh has so much worth showing off.","63","1931533"
"9363","Days of Thunder relies on charm, loud noise and a few racing sequences to print money with Cocky's visage on the bills: there can be no suspense because there can be no possibility Cocky will lose. [29 Jun 1990, p.C1]","63","99371"
"9364","Blade doesn't manage to work up a whole lot of suspense.","63","120611"
"9365","A slick, shiny video game of a movie bursting with computer-generated chase scenes and cool gadgets.","63","343818"
"9366","It’s a brutal slog of a film, admirable in its fearlessness in terms of dark subject matter, but the brutality doesn’t feel worth it in the end.","63","5057140"
"9367","What we’re instead left with are two diametrically opposed performances: Williams goes small and intimate as the distressed Isabel, while Moore opts for a more operatic, less successful tenor that results in what might be the actress’s most unhinged moment ever (and not in a good way).","63","7985692"
"9368","Entertainments like this are what Hollywood is said to be all about: larger than life personalities redeeming material smaller than a breadbox. [23 July 1982]","63","83642"

"9372","Zealots flip over Endgame.","63","144964"
"9373","There's no debating that Bad Words contains some big, politically incorrect laughs. The movie isn't awash in them but there are enough to keep the chuckles coming. The film's problem is that, despite obvious aspirations to be more than just a profane joke factory, it never fulfills its dramatic ambitions.","63","2170299"
"9374","What more could a horror fan ask for than a spook-fest that feels pure in its intentions while taking full advantage of every opportunity to scare us silly?","63","1139668"
"9375","Caddyshack never finds a consistent comic note of its own, but it plays host to all sorts of approaches from its stars, who sometimes hardly seem to be occupying the same movie.","63","80487"
"9376","The good-natured tension and ribbing between the two old “boys” is still there — and still a bit old hat — but there is a new dynamic that juices the entertainment factor.","63","1502397"
"9377","The film, for all its prestige and edginess, its lofty goals and contemporary messages, is not a particularly engrossing experience.","63","2328900"
"9378","Observing Zellweger as she dispenses her brand of movie magic definitely is good for what ails you.","63","171580"
"9379","Now that it has been set to film, it seems somehow dated as well. The greed of the 1980s, thematic backdrop for Mamet's original, is presumed gone. Glengarry Glen Ross looks almost . . . quaint. [02 Oct 1992, p.G5]","63","104348"
"9380","It's good cornball mainstream sci-fi, as close to brand-name reliability as this genre gets. [18 Nov. 1994, p.47]","63","111280"
"9381","As the hero, Christopher Reeve oozes with sincerity in the world-peace scenes - he helped write the story of the film, and this may be why he overdoes it. But he's also funny when he gets back to being klutzy Clark Kent, so the movie doesn't completely drown in its own good intentions.","63","94074"
"9382","The best things about Never Been Kissed are its colorful camera work and funny dialogue.","63","151738"
"9383","The film never makes total sense, but at its best (the first half-hour), it comes closer to solidly junky titillation than the hapless Final Analysis. [20 Mar 1992, Life, p.1D]","63","103772"
"9384","It all works quite well as glossy entertainment, but ultimately The Bodyguard satisfies only if you don't think about it too much. [25 Nov 1992, p.D3]","63","103855"
"9385","McGuigan’s visually vivid Victor Frankenstein races to its lightning-storm finish, running over the solid (if not electrifying) acting of McAvoy and Radcliffe.","63","1976009"
"9386","A fascinating but flawed work that demonstrates that, contrary to popular wisdom, great minds do not think alike.","63","212720"
"9387","There's always Witherspoon, swimming upstream and never letting it slow her down. Blindingly purposeful, she's a perky blond tornado. Marilyn Monroe would not only have cheered her on. She'd have learned something.","63","250494"
"9388","Adequately funny but predictable sitcom","63","207201"
"9389","There's plenty to admire in the performances and atmosphere, but the writer-director needed someone to pull him up short.","63","757361"
"9390","It's important to talk at length about Pariah's aesthetic because of how it distracts from the emotional truthfulness of the sometimes heartbreaking, by and large gorgeously performed story.","63","1233334"
"9391","Still, even Disney and a PG rating can't bury Burton's subversive wit. Like Carroll, he's a master at dressing up psychic wounds in fantasy.","63","1014759"

"9398","Way too much of Game Night is given away in the trailer, the violence is a bit much and truth be told — the folding in on itself plot gets in its own way, especially in the third act. But Bateman makes the big bucks for being the best put-upon “hero” in comedy. And McAdams, doing an epic Amanda Plummer (“Pulp You Know What,” remember?) absolutely steals the picture.","63","2704998"
"9399","The question that should be asked is whether Woody Allen has made a good movie this time out, and the honest answer is ""almost.""","63","416320"
"9400","Todd Haynes's Wonderstruck is a coming-of-age tale as curiosity cabinet, a flowchart of narrative fragments that steadily build to a high-concept finale as ludicrous as it is emotionally audacious.","63","5208216"
"9401","Where ""Mall Cop"" is broad, safe and sticks to a formula, Observe and Report is unabashedly crude, cynical, off-kilter and funnier.","63","1197628"

"9407","Law shines like a sunbeam, warming the film with rakish charm and unexpected emotionalism.","63","457939"
"9408","Yet while Nemes criticized “Schindler’s List” as “conventional,” all that’s new here is the hyper-realistic technique: Saul’s quest is not very far from the girl in the red dress.","63","3808342"
"9409","Perversely enough, the comedy is what keeps the picture rolling; it's the so-called action that persists in bringing the thing to a screeching halt.","63","910936"
"9410","There is something repulsive and manipulative about it, and even its best scenes have the flavor of a kid in the school yard, trying to show you pictures you don't feel like looking at.","63","100935"
"9411","Owen Wilson manages to break his customary comic relief persona and is adept at playing a little ""Father Knows Best""; the yellow lab does a good job too.","63","822832"
"9412","Flashes of inspiration illuminate stretches of routine sitcom material; it's the kind of movie where the audience laughs loudly and then falls silent for the next five minutes.","63","328099"
"9413","If you've never seen a ""masala"" musical, you may find Lagaan hilariously bad. Cartoony acting, dreadful dialogue, obvious dubbing, and meandering but ultrapredictable plots are simply part of the Bollywood package, along with six musical numbers and a bizarre mixture of romance, comedy and melodrama.","63","169102"
"9414","By turns silly and amazing, a mishmash of Kubrickian devices accompanied by a steady Spielbergian drip of sentimentality.","63","181689"
"9415","Far from the movie of the year, the first installment of the long-awaited Lord of the Rings trilogy is an all-around disappointment.","63","120737"
"9416","Perhaps Downsizing needed to be downsized a bit; as it is, it’s an intriguing concept that slips away.","63","1389072"
"9417","It’s a biopic about one of the most brilliant people in the history of the planet, the renowned astrophysicist Stephen Hawking – a man famous for thinking in boldly innovative ways – yet his story is told in the safest and most conventional method imaginable.","63","2980516"
"9418","The plot is bare-bones stuff, weak in story line and bereft of motivation.","63","119256"
"9419","The musical score is a dud, and the film is one firebomb too long. But GoldenEye's vision is 20/20 when it comes to reviving a legend. [17Nov1995 Pg.01.D]","63","113189"
"9420","Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home is the dopiest and most congenial in the series, an indication that the producers have at last acknowledged that what they're dealing with is not science fiction or adventure, but a kind of cosmic fluke. [27 Nov. 1986, p.F1]","63","92007"
"9421","The longer the movie goes, the more its 133 minutes prove wearing. The story tries to develop a love angle between Jackman and Janssen, but it doesn't begin to take. And the finale is particularly weak.","63","290334"
"9422","The meta jokes come thick and fast - some clunk, but there's no time to mourn - and the references are far from limited to the Warner Bros. world (at one point, Bugs exclaims, ""Whaddya know - I found Nemo!"").","63","318155"
"9423","While it pays lip service to the fascinating theatrical norms of pro wrestling, the film ends up expending most of its energy on its search for barriers that Paige can break through.","63","6513120"
"9424","The movie's faults aside, this is the kind of show where half the fun is watching it in the company of a large group of people.","63","1179904"
"9425","The movie didn't quite work for me. Its timing wasn't confident enough to pull off its ambitious conception.","63","73692"
"9426","The film doesn't make us work, doesn't allow us to figure out things for ourselves, is afraid we'll miss things if they're not spelled out.","63","104257"
"9427","Disney's latest incarnation parries and feints somewhere between the ""serious"" melodramas of vintage Hollywood and the frisky cavortings of Richard Lester's mid-'70s send-ups. [13 Nov 1993, p.G3]","63","108333"
"9428","Preposterous without being much fun about it. That's a shame: How often do you get to see Cruise play a professional assassin with Bill Clinton's hair?","63","369339"
"9429","But at the risk of sounding ungrateful, Sydney Pollack's latest film should have been a lot better.","63","373926"
"9430","Designer babies rule dystopia in stylish SF thriller filled with recycled plot devices.","63","119177"
"9431","Powerful war spectacle neglects novel's heart and much of story.","63","120863"
"9432","Part horror, part comedy, THE LOST BOYS is a vampire thriller that brings some interesting twists to the genre, but is nearly defeated by director Joel Schumacher's heavy-handed efforts to bring an MTV-like sensibility to the traditionally gothic material. Despite its flaws, however, the film is an interesting addition to vampire cinema.","63","93437"
"9433","There's too much cheese, but there are still enough amusing action beats and funny one-liners to let one say, 30 Minutes or Less delivers, more or less on time.","63","1622547"
"9434","I can’t say I enjoyed it, but Midsommar did what the Midnight Sun does to anybody who first experiences it. It kept me up all night.","63","8772262"
"9435","It is, by any rational measure, an absolute mess....But we should all know by now that Lynch cannot be judged by ""rational measures,"" and if you're a ""Peaks"" aficionado who can easily shift into Lynch's gear, Fire Walk With Me will cast an undeniable spell.","63","105665"
"9436","Certainly it's the weakest of Ford's major westerns, burdened with a schematic and pretentious Dudley Nichols script (the ""cross section of society"" on board the stagecoach), but its virtues remain intact.","63","31971"
"9437","The footage on the Paris Island obstacle course is powerful. But Full Metal Jacket is uncertain where to go, and the movie's climax, which Kubrick obviously intends to be a mighty moral revelation, seems phoned in from earlier war pictures.","63","93058"
"9438","The film eventually runs out of rocket fuel, piling on the special effects but arriving at a disappointing conclusion.","63","1355644"
"9439","The film is good to excellent in every way except morally, and there it's questionable more often than it should be, not because it's an evil film, or because the filmmaker or actors are bad people, but because the interplay of means and ends have been under-thought or misjudged, to the point where the film becomes a catalog of obscenities.","63","1365050"
"9440","It's funny but (sorry, ladies) unrealistic that Jake continuously sneaks away from his young wife to canoodle with Jane. Baldwin is a blast, but the role requires him to indulge in indignities such as a naked webcam conversation.","63","1230414"
"9441","Yet for all the fun the sequel provides, the series shows signs of wearing out quickly, unless characters get developed thoroughly and in unexpected ways.","63","316654"
"9442","A massive compendium of youth-movie/pedal-to-the-metal cliches. But man, is it fast!","63","232500"
"9443","It's grim, funny in one sequence about shapeshifters, vivid in moments of violent action, nearly devoid of plot twists and marked by long patches where Harry, Ron and Hermione camp in the woods or by the sea or near a frozen lake and ponder What It All Means.","63","926084"
"9444","The screenplay's enigmatic nature holds one's interest throughout, even as the film veers into pat moralism.","63","4540710"
"9445","This is a film about depression, though, and it comes awfully close to trivializing its subject by suggesting that all Craig needed, really, was a cute girl to like him back.","63","804497"
"9446","Allison Janney is tacky incarnate as Barkin's good-time gal pal. When she shows up, Drop Dead Gorgeous comes most to life. [23 July 1999, Life, p.12E]","63","157503"
"9447","Sinks or swims with the actors. Gallner makes a very convincing boy-about-to-die; Madsen is his properly stricken mom; and Donovan, an under-used leading man, plays the stressed, guilt-ridden dad well.","63","492044"
"9448","By far the best thing about Pitch Black is the cool-looking lighting and photography.","63","134847"
"9449","The trouble is that the plot is so elliptical to be almost unfollowable (though it helps to have seen the trailer).","63","324127"
"9450","For a holding maneuver, Thor itself turns out to be diverting enough - not close to a sharp-edged romp like ""Iron Man"" but not the B-movie roadshow some of us were expecting.","63","800369"
"9451","The problem with a story like this is that it's almost too perfect. It tends to break out of the boundaries of the typical sports movie, and undermine those easy cliches that are so reassuring to sports fans.","63","106611"
"9452","For most of the movie, Cody and Reitman jape at her until, in the last 20 minutes or so, they attempt to turn her into an object of sympathy. It doesn't work and, on balance, neither does Young Adult.","63","1625346"
"9453","While the whole film is well-made, it has surprisingly few surprises. There are some small ones, but the plot and many details are predictable down to small details. [7 Oct 1988, p.F13]","63","94631"
"9454","The problem with Semi-Pro is that it keeps forgetting it's a parody of sports movies; the final scenes are supposed to be uplifting (sort of) but they're not fooling anyone. The film's much better when it just lets the guys gas and sass each other.","63","839980"
"9455","The dynamic between Fletcher and Andrew makes for highly pitched drama, which strains for credibility during two climactic scenes.","63","2582802"
"9456","Rarely has more high-powered movie technology been deployed to achieve such frivolous ends. Kids seem to love it, while sophisticated viewers may find it enchanting, appalling, or both.","63","109813"
"9457","Anderson has taken pains to re-create the '50s with superb production design and gorgeous cinematography. But he seems less concerned with whether the audience is along for the ride. The story can leave viewers at sea, floundering to give meaning to what they are watching.","63","1560747"
"9458","In the end, it's the self-mocking aura that save this film from being a waste of two hours.","63","120616"
"9459","As a comedy, The Mask is genial, but its recycled plot is far too thin for the film to succeed as either an adventure or a spoof.","63","110475"
"9460","Sometimes funny, sometimes clever, and occasionally involving, but it's never brilliant and its edge is compromised by the neutering that accompanies the teen-friendly PG-13 rating.","63","448157"
"9461","The movie is too pious for farce and too eager to please to comment persuasively on the racial horrors of the Deep South at that time.","63","1454029"
"9462","Fans of the original should relish going back to Back to the Future, as long as they keep in mind that in movies - as in life - you can't go home again. And if you do, things aren't likely to be the same. [22 Nov 1989, p.E1]","63","96874"
"9463","Its performances are resourceful and affecting, with Chastain and Worthington in the past sequences, and Mirren and Wilkinson in the later chapters, exuding a complicated mess of responsibility, guilt, sacrifice, revenge, and regret.","63","1226753"
"9464","There are plenty of good sight gags here, and anyone who can work the phrase ""ass clown"" into a script is all right with me.","63","151804"
"9465","Like a lot of well-staged parties, though, the affair peaks shortly after the introductions, and then devolves into intrigues, fights and mayhem.","63","411477"
"9466","Bill Condon's Beauty and the Beast actually delivers a remarkably optimistic balm to a festering, existential wound.","63","2771200"
"9467","Roma is arty and beautiful, but also a bit like sitting on a sofa while Cuarón flips through family photo albums, never narrating or over-explaining any single moment or image.","63","6155172"
"9468","A mixed bag of four short films done in the style of famous '60s TV show. Two work; two don't. [July 22, 1983]","63","86491"
"9469","The Beguiled serves as proof that what goes for naturalism in Sofia Coppola’s dominion still verges on being decorative to the point of self-parody.","63","5592248"
"9470","A not-as-bad-as-you-think-it-is romantic comedy.","63","1212436"
"9471","Does this stylistically unstylish picture stand with the lurid glories of “Casino,” the pulse-pounding narrative drive and cinema semiotics of “The Departed,” or the charismatic cynicism of “Goodfellas?” Give me a freaking break.","63","1302006"
"9472","Neither as funny and scary as the first, nor as campy and breathless as the second, Alien 3 can only settle for third best. Considering the state of sci-fi movies, that may be enough. [22 May 1992, p.12D]","63","103644"
"9473","Frigid soul or not, it's the most unforgettable supernatural comedy since Brazil. Could be it's time for the Coens to drop the pretense, and embrace sci-fi head on. [11 Mar 1994, p.4D]","63","110074"
"9474","Hawke delivers a strong melancholy variation on his familiar emotional cool as Reverend Toller.","63","6053438"
"9475","This enigma-delivery system from a sharp mind has enthralling moments but becomes a bit enervating in its self-seriousness. By the end, the whole thing feels more academic than mind-bending.","63","2084989"
"9476","The movie is so “interior,” it so zeroes in on Isaac and his baleful stare, that we’re relieved any time something overtly funny happens.","63","2042568"
"9477","Maybe the Midwest isn't actually like this, but if it were, would that be so bad?","63","1477837"
"9478","The payoff fizzles, but the buildup is intriguing until it topples under its own weight.","63","810988"
"9479","Nocturnal Animals gets close to a double-barreled satirical thriller commenting on the historic rift between city and country.","63","4550098"
"9480","Bruce Almighty would rather go runny and bland, mostly where Aniston's Grace is concerned.","63","315327"
"9481","Enough SpongeBob-meets-Monty-Python silliness to give adults a kick as well.","63","298388"
"9482","Lion's faults of structure and pacing might limit its power, but in stretches it still roars.","63","3741834"
"9483","There are a few brilliantly realized moments, the acting is mostly strong despite the weak script (Affleck and Cavill are both superb—Affleck unexpectedly so), and there's enough mythic raw material sunk deep in every scene that you can piece together a classic in your mind if you're feeling charitable; but if you aren't, “Batman v. Superman” will seem like a missed opportunity.","63","2975590"
"9484","Equal parts ""Mad Max"" and ""Day of the Dead,"" this third and supposedly final entry in the Resident Evil franchise is no less derivative than its predecessors but moves along at a brisk clip.","63","432021"
"9485","Feels less like an epic drama about power and the power of love than an episode of a Masterpiece Theatre mini-series.","63","467200"
"9486","Lohan, in her third lead role in a year, is a good reactive young actress, and London, Ont., native Rachel McAdams is excellently evil, a dose of poison in a pretty lacquered container.","63","377092"
"9487","Disclosure should slickly satisfy people who like movies about advanced computers, topical themes, hardball attorney mind games, office politics, sex and sweet revenge. [9 Dec 1994, p.1D]","63","109635"
"9488","Unfortunately, like far too many films, this one gives up the ghost during the last fifteen minutes, saddling an otherwise-enjoyable film with a dumb ending.","63","120791"
"9489","Although the first half still works – largely due to the performance of Anne Bancroft as the iconic Mrs. Robinson – the second half is a mess with only a couple of funny lines to recommend it.","63","61722"
"9490","Manages to pop the hairs on the back of your neck more than most repetitive, predictable and gory Hollywood horror films these days.","63","2321549"
"9491","A story of filth and fury and, eventually, of placidity and peace, Her Smell is Alex Ross Perry’s most chaotic and unmuffled film — until it isn’t.","63","7942742"
"9492","It’s not especially filling, but it leaves a pleasant aftertaste.","63","844471"
"9493","Needs less down-to-earth flavor and more unearthly force.","63","164181"
"9494","A well-made, excruciating exercise in containment and sustained suspense. It's a breakout moment for Reynolds. Is it a fun hour and a half? No. But it succeeds within its own straitened contours. It's an intriguing squirm. Now, please get me outta here.","63","1462758"
"9495","The film is elegantly done, mainly because it wisely expends most of its energy on Alicia Vikander’s face.","63","1441953"
"9496","The Old Man and the Gun ambles along with such unhurried, folksy ease that it’s easy to overlook the people — mostly women — Tucker leaves in his wake, victims who may not be physically scarred, but often look as if they will bear unseen injuries into the future nonetheless.","63","2837574"
"9497","It's a slow, repetitive, meandering, mostly overacted little picture - perfectly agreeable but nothing special, and directed with a steamroller by David O. Russell. Go figure.","63","1045658"
"9498","There are times when Austin Powers drags. It can be difficult to sustain even the best humor for ninety minutes, and this film, for all of the laughs it offers, is far from the best.","63","118655"
"9499","In the end, The Founder is little more than a deflating reminder, as if we needed one, that the winner takes all, and integrity isn’t always the key to success.","63","4276820"
"9500","You have to take the bad with the good here: Green Room may be too schematic to fully capture the essence of its characters' groddy milieu, but it's also economically paced, and gorgeous.","63","4062536"
"9501","Instead of a tense, emotional and psychological thriller or a thoughtful exploration of grief and guilt, what we end up with is ... soap. Whether you choose to wash your hands of it is up to you.","63","831884"
"9502","It's been well-publicized that Affleck, going for as authentic a feel as possible, cast many genuine South Bostoners in both extra and speaking roles, and, while that's salutary, in some scenes his strategy backfires, yielding caricatures that are merely more vivid than the ones turned out by Central Casting Hollywood productions.","63","452623"
"9503","There is something weirdly appealing about Commando and its self-deprecating celebration of violent excess. [16 Oct 1985, p.D5]","63","88944"
"9504","What we have here is a suburban-legend movie stripped of rough edges and cut off from any depth that might have made it insidiously haunting.","63","298130"
"9505","The wonder and terror of Meryl Streep's performance in The Iron Lady is her formidable ability to nail the disheartening talents of not just Margaret Thatcher, but so many conservative politicians like her, who have a tremendous knack for changing minds and beckoning cheers while underlining their own rigid ignorance.","63","1007029"
"9506","The Killer goes on too long and never properlystitches together into the plot its strands of suspense and romance, butit never lacks for ballistic racket. A few scenes in recent movies haveseen the firepower under which that whitewashed church disintegrates atmovie's end; a few, but not many. [12 July 1991]","63","97202"
"9507","What saves Point Break from wipeout is Kathryn Bigelow's direction. Though the film lacks the formal beauty and allure of her Near Dark and Blue Steel, Bigelow keeps the action percolating in high style.","63","102685"
"9508","On the plus side, bloated narratives make for a busy action star, and Bruce is quite the workaholic on this outing, clearly eager to rekindle memories of his ""Die Hard"" glory days.","63","340163"
"9509","Despite a moving, canny incarnation of the man by Frank Langella, despite a slickly entertaining coffee-table production as only Ron Howard knows how, the movie feels cooked up.","63","870111"
"9510","If you’re looking for some big, stupid fun, you could do worse than Street Kings.","63","421073"
"9511","The film spends its first act establishing a flimsy emotional groundwork before gleefully taking a sledgehammer to it just seconds into act two.","63","2302755"
"9512","Owen and Riseborough play their characters awfully close to the vest, not investing in anything that would allow this story to take the romantic or melodramatic turns we expect. But truthfully, that hamstrings the movie.","63","1770734"
"9513","The picture doesn't inspire or reward high expectations, but it raises smiles.","63","1284575"
"9514","It’s even dumber than the earlier installments, but it knows it. And the result is some good, clean kid-friendly fun, save for the odd profanity — Odin is known for his curses, after all. Even the killing seems to lack fatal finality.","63","3501632"
"9515","Impresses more than it entertains.","63","209958"
"9516","The result is initially exhilarating, ultimately exhausting.","63","446029"
"9517","Waxwork is certainly no hidden horror gem, but its flashes of wit and genuine enthusiasm for the horror genre are enough to make it a reasonably enjoyable time.","63","96426"
"9518","Fast Times at Ridgemont High could have been the sleeper success of the summer, but uncertainty of tone and a lame, derivative ending reduce it to the status of a missed opportunity. [13 Aug 1982, p.D6]","63","83929"
"9519","The film version, competently directed by Clint Eastwood and beautifully acted by Meryl Streep, isn't about to mess with a popular formula - this is a straight-up adaptation as faithful as a fawning spouse.","63","112579"
"9520","The characters are only superficially sketched in, but we still fear for them, understand their code and above all else, appreciate the dirty, bloody, high-risk work these professionals do. That they go through all this and risk everything, by choice, is something Berg, to his credit, never lets us forget.","63","1091191"
"9521","Yes, yes, it's Liar Liar 2.","63","1068680"
"9522","I found the opening third tremendously intriguing and involving, I thought the emotions were so real they could be touched, but then the film lost its way and fell into the clutches of sentimental melodrama.","63","822849"
"9523","Kendrick is terrific, taking a role that could have slid by on snide and building it into something uniquely funny and touching.","63","1981677"
"9524","This isn't a bad movie; it's watchable but the direction in which the filmmakers choose to take it results in a vague sense of dissatisfaction.","63","435705"
"9525","What it does have going for it are its lead actors -- Brand and Hill both know exactly how to deliver a punch line -- and a lead character who represents one of the best bits of rock 'n' roll satire since ""This Is Spinal Tap.""","63","1226229"
"9526","Saldana is in top form for the acrobatics required in the role, and she makes the gritty determination of her character believable.","63","1657507"
"9527","It's skillfully mounted and fitfully intriguing, but weaves such a tangled web that at the end I defy anyone in the audience to explain the exact loyalties and motives of the leading characters.","63","244244"
"9528","[A] socially conscious sprawler... Sayles' latest never bores during its 21/4-hour unreeling. But neither does it soar, despite finessing a complex flashback narrative set in 1957 and present-day. [21 June 1996, p.3D]","63","116905"
"9529","Each time a character gets tossed in the air by some manifestation or another, the effect is cheesy. Still, I've seen worse. For the record, the violence in Annabelle is far less copious and sadistic than the stuff in the Denzel Washington movie everybody's going to.","63","3322940"
"9530","Whereas the more grounded scenes of Death Note anchor a startlingly bloody fantasy of power run amok, the scenes that fixate on super powers and code-busting seldom manage to rise above the realm of serviceable YA fiction.","63","1241317"
"9531","Moves along well until the characters and situations become too ridiculous to be believed.","63","1017460"
"9532","There are a lot of promising ideas here, but none are developed so much that this remake feels essential.","63","5628902"
"9533","The plot runs out of steam just past the one-hour mark and the charade, although necessary to the story, goes on for too long. The ending is, of course, the requisite happy one, but it seems a little anticlimactic.","63","114924"
"9534","In the end, Phantom needed more human and less digital scale. The magic of ""Star Wars"" lay in Lucas' ability to play the human comedy in a fantastic future. With Phantom, he has brought the series to the brink of total artificiality, the future as a video game.","63","120915"
"9535","Haggis lets us get way ahead of the characters and the figure out what thetitle of this writerly tale — Third Person — has to do with the sometimesillogical connections between stories. That’s not a problem. Dragging, draggingdragging the tales out after he reaches a logical climax and something close toa resolution with each is not.","63","2343793"
"9536","One of those movies that starts like a house afire, catches you firmly in its narrative grip and then suddenly blows itself out, not really going out with a whimper but with a big, bad, ludicrous bang.","63","278435"
"9537","The Karate Kid might have been more endurable, maybe even endearing, if its runtime had been trimmed of a solid 30 minutes.","63","87538"
"9538","sStarts and finishes strong, but, somewhere in the middle, it loses its focus and its way.","63","115734"
"9539","It has been said that no one sees a movie for the sets, yet an exception might be made here for Horizon's visually staggering production design -- truly an event itself. The story, though, is such a transparent variation on the Alien ouevre that your tolerance may hinge on how much you can shrug this off. [15Aug1997 Pg03.D]","63","119081"
"9540","Though Little Miss Sunshine is consistently contrived in its characters' too-cute misery, the conclusion, which is genuinely outrageous and uplifting, is almost worth the hype.","63","449059"
"9541","A testosterone- and cliché-fueled epic that will have some hoping for sudden death as it stumbles toward the three-hour mark.","63","146838"
"9542","There's an audience for old-fashioned romance, and Dear John will please most of it.","63","989757"
"9543","War of the Worlds pushes some of the right buttons and enough of the wrong ones to make you wish that Spielberg would move on from aliens already and use his unparalleled talents to focus once more on earth.","63","407304"
"9544","As the end credits are rolling: What happened? Suddenly, the film stalls, and everything that looked great -- the mechanics of the caper, the grafted-on wit and wisdom -- starts to feel repetitious and a tad gimmicky.","63","454848"
"9545","Hardcore Henry is like a good roller-coaster in that it does not require a complex reason to be: it's there, it's fun, you ride it, and that's about it.","63","3072482"
"9546","Despite dashes of droll dialogue from screenwriter Ted Griffin, the remake aims for cool but instead gets chilly.","63","240772"
"9547","Mudbound is not a great film, not polished enough to earn its “Oscar contender” hype. But it is a worthwhile one. It doesn’t touch us the way the sentimental “Places in the Heart” did, but doesn’t flinch (much) from showing the Bad Old Days at their very worst, which more sentimental films on this subject invariably do.","63","2396589"
"9548","As an action fix to hold you before the summer explosions start, you could do worse than The Losers. It’s no more than an efficient time-killer.","63","480255"
"9549","Likable as it is, suffers from that modern big-movie vice: overkill.","63","349903"
"9550","Arnold has a gem for the third millennium in End of Days.","63","146675"
"9551","Flashdance makes liberal use of jump cuts, strobe lighting and hard-edged, post-punk chic in its dance sequences, it registers as the end product of energy being released by an essentially lyrical temperament. It charms us, makes us want to refrain from scrutinizing it too closely. [31 Jul 1983, p.1]","63","85549"
"9552","Despite two strong lead performances and a welcome dose of female empowerment, this somber tale feels too familiar and formulaic.","63","1840309"
"9553","At his best, Spike Lee is too brave to be subtle.","63","215545"
"9554","For all of its huge budget, Independence Day is a timid movie when it comes to imagination. The aliens, when we finally see them, are a serious disappointment.","63","116629"
"9555","All of this could have been nice and juicy if Walter Hill had done a few more things with his screenplay, such as made the characters into people.","63","77474"
"9556","Beaches begins on a note of impending doom, and that colors everything else with an undertone of bittersweet poignancy and, believe me, there is only so much bittersweet poignancy I can take in any one movie.","63","94715"
"9557","The plot is predictable and the dialogue often sticky sweet, but at least kids will identify with Stuart's desire for adventure and exploration.","63","243585"
"9558","The movie is simply too long for its own good.","63","381061"
"9559","Despite small but powerful gestures in the finale, it leaves the audience feeling just as immobilized and powerless as its characters. Labaki chose the title Capernaum because the word was often used to mean “chaos” in French literature. That’s precisely what she presents to us, with precious little relief in sight.","63","8267604"
"9560","Driving Miss Daisy unfolds at a leisurely pace, with great attention to period detail and character-aging makeup effects....It's occasionally quite funny, and relentlessly good-hearted. And never, ever does it whack you over the head with its theme. [12 Jan. 1990, p.G5]","63","97239"
"9561","Caine and Law may not be playing human beings, but Pinter’s sense of humor is at least more interesting than Shaffer’s. Caine in particular appears to enjoy honing his cold-eyed stare.","63","857265"
"9562","Familiar B-movie fare, but it's also lively fun and presented with well-paced flair.","63","455407"
"9563","Ingrid Goes West doesn’t quite go south, but in diving headfirst into the swamp of Internet addiction, its vision gets a little murky.","63","5962210"
"9564","The movie putters along as softly as Wendy drives. Despite its lack of narrative horsepower, though, its character sketches are pleasing. And amusing.","63","3062976"
"9565","The choice made by Kevin Spacey in taking on the role of Quoyle in the film adaptation of E. Annie Proulx's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel The Shipping News nearly sinks it. But not quite.","63","120824"
"9566","So, yeah, Kin is a bit of a biker movie, too. More important, it’s also a family drama. In their first-time feature-directing effort, twin brothers Jonathan and Josh Baker — speaking of kin — turn Cain and Abel inside out and upside down. Why be east of Eden when you end up that far west of Motown?","63","6017942"
"9567","Scott doesn't bring much to the table as an action director, and his keen storytelling abilities go invisible here.","63","758774"
"9568","Easy A is unnecessarily hard on the religious kids. Unlike ""Saved,"" it uses broad caricatures of gospel-singing fanatics to get laughs, and the bug-eyed, over-the-top performance by Bynes (who apparently really should have retired after making this film) doesn't help matters.","63","1282140"
"9569","Ready to Wear has entertaining bits, but for a film about people converging on Paris to increase the hysteria and anxiety levels, Ready to Wear has surprisingly little urgency. [23 Dec 1994, p.48]","63","110907"
"9570","A manically playful revenge fantasia made from the spare parts of Sergio Leone spaghetti westerns and strapping World War II action flicks.","63","361748"
"9571","The best audiences for this thrilling confabulation may be younger ones: They’ll feel their minds expand with inspiration and be less inclined to deflate back to earth afterward. Somebody did something amazing back in 1862; The Aeronauts commemorates it with artifice, enthusiasm, and a smattering of the truth.","63","6141246"
"9572","“Lost City” aims for a sort of new-fashioned old-fashioned approach to this subject, and that unfortunately makes it more Earthbound than soaring, more pedestrian than epic.","63","1212428"
"9573","While the film contains some terrific, realistically bloody battle scenes, it has a distinctly Germanic feel, both in its epic heaviness and in the peculiar way it revises the history of the American Revolution.","63","187393"
"9574","In real life, Bacon and Sedgwick are husband and wife. Their scenes mark one of the rare times an off-screen couple's intimacy enriches on-screen passion.","63","361127"
"9575","Though it has the requisite murder every 10 minutes or so (including victims snapped in half and punched through the heart, and a triple decapitation), Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives feels more like a harbinger for the Scream series with its self-aware jokiness.","63","91080"
"9576","We're more likely to snicker at this marauding monster than scream.","63","402057"
"9577","The one element in the movie that is not standard and that does have some energy is the TV show itself, with Dawson's performance as the egotistical, sleaze-bag host.","63","93894"
"9578","Akin to being force-fed sugary confections from a bottomless bowl. At first the idea seems just grand, but after a while, all you want to do is scream, ""Enough!""","63","211915"
"9579","What sucks the wind out of the movie's sails is the vacuum at its core.","63","320661"
"9580","The Big Sick makes good use of some vintage Nanjiani 9/11 comebacks, some winning (if not new) backstage backbiting comedy club observations and marvelous, heartfelt work by three great actors who carry their leading man and his overlong, not-a-million-laughs “personal” story across the finish line.","63","5462602"
"9581","I’m flummoxed as to why the movie left me feeling up in the air, as opposed to over the moon. Partly, I think, it’s a matter of how Anderson’s sense of humor rubs up against that of the book’s author, Roald Dahl.","63","432283"
"9582","It's most towering accomplishment are its set pieces, which manage to be brash, exhilarating, and even occasionally moving.","63","1398426"
"9583","Distilled to its basics, it's little more than a sit-com that has been tarted up with scenes of projectile poop, odd sexual fetishes, and knife wielding babies. It all seems a little tired and, more importantly, not as funny as it should be.","63","1488555"
"9584","Trades breathless romance for a fun ""Ripley's Believe it or Not""-flavored weirdness.","63","450405"
"9585","Too many questions are raised with no good answers.","63","128853"
"9586","Now and Then tells twin stories. One is a delight. One is a disastrous distraction. [20 Oct 1995]","63","114011"
"9587","Turns out to be a Hollywood sequel of surpassing silliness and wasted talent.","63","289848"
"9588","As Diesel says, ''I like something fast enough to do something stupid in.'' Mission accomplished.","63","295701"
"9589","TMNT has a cool, noirish sheen. There's an attention to detail in the visuals and sound design that pushes it up several notches above most kiddie fare. It's not art, dude, but it will do.","63","453556"
"9590","One problem with Repo Men is that there's not enough material to sustain a 111-minute motion picture.","63","1053424"
"9591","Yes, a Terence Malick film remains an event, but he appears awfully disoriented in The New World -- less a seasoned traveller than a perplexed tourist, content to mask his confusion by reaching for a camera and snapping relentless pretty pictures.","63","402399"
"9592","Drawing upon ""Wag the Dog,"" ""Dr. Strangelove"" and ""This Is Spinal Tap,"" this sardonic tale is adapted from the critically acclaimed BBC series ""The Thick of It.""","63","1226774"
"9593","Crowe is too much the good employee to spin the yarn properly, to give the picture the very integrity it endorses. He might have made a more convincing movie had he first convinced himself.","63","116695"
"9594","It’s a fairly engrossing bit of fan service, boasting many clever touches and a few disappointing ones. Director and co-writer David Gordon Green’s picture veers erratically in tone, and the killings are sort of a drag after a while, en route to a rousing vengeance finale.","63","1502407"
"9595","For all its inconsistencies, this is Smith's most provocative outing yet and certainly the toughest to forget.","63","118842"
"9596","Secret Window leaves you unsatisfied and frustrated. Depp's performance both makes the film and undercuts it. He's a poet caught in a machine.","63","363988"
"9597","A few crude verbal exchanges nearly got Clerks an NC-17 rating; some (not all) of these provide some of the funniest moments in a film that's funny about 30% of the time. [24 Oct 1994]","63","109445"
"9598","Offers a primal vision of the primate order turned topsy-turvy. It is provocative. It is frightening. It is a mess.","63","133152"
"9599","And although The Cooler doesn't do anything fresh with its Vegas milieu, the movie is refreshingly frank and astute when it comes to depicting sex.","63","318374"
"9600","More than anything, The Grifters isn't dramatically shot; black-and-white would have made a huge difference. [5 Dec 1990]","63","99703"
"9601","Rarely has a star's look-at-me turn so completely torpedoed a project. Whenever the picture threatens to gain some momentum, up pops Jack to stop it dead in its tracks. The loyal few may be laughing with him, but the rest of us are definitely laughing at him.","63","407887"
"9602","The result this time is just as hit and miss. But when it hits, yowsa.","63","2702724"
"9603","Perhaps no movie could do Muhammad Ali justice. But this overlong but sketchy biopic by Michael Mann, in which style repeatedly tramples substance, actually does the great man a disservice.","63","248667"
"9604","This film that imagines the end of the world not as a whimper but as an implosion is a preposterously diverting, instantly forgettable, big-screen video game.","63","1190080"
"9605","""It's one of the problems I have with Hannah. I feel I haven't gone deeply enough."" Should Woody Allen ever tire of making movies, he can take up criticizing them.","63","91167"

"9607","That doesn’t make Oblivion a bad movie, just a familiar one — generic.","63","1483013"
"9608","David Frankel crams his story with predictable developments, yet he matches his subject in spirit, pushing something into the spotlight that, however unlikely, elicits irresistible glee.","63","1196956"
"9609","This one's a step down from the original.","63","3896198"
"9610","As funereal as it all can feel, All is True manages the wistfulness that must have been Branagh’s design, the director of “Thor” and “Murder on the Orient Express” returning to his first love, his idol, for an affectionate if somewhat perfunctory portrait.","63","9206798"
"9611","Despite its flaws, The Box remains intriguing; however, as its mysteries are solved, the prevailing sense is one of frustration rather than satisfaction. That makes The Box worthy of the dubious label of ""an interesting failure.""","63","362478"
"9612","For the first time in years (even counting his excellent work in “Internal Affairs”), Richard Gere's acting gears aren't too obviously apparent; Julia Roberts, though the breadth of her emotional range remains in question, is beautiful and can act - a not-bad blueprint for continued employment.

"9613","It's a work that preaches to the choir, and the song has been more subtly sung in better movies.","63","180073"
"9614","Coppola has raised the stakes, promising the definitive version of the vampire story. What he has created, however, is fresh and original yet boring, an exercise more in art direction than storytelling. [13 Nov 1992, p. C]","63","103874"
"9615","The third Die Hard film is easily the most spectacular, featuring an exploding subway train and a manic car chase through the congested streets of New York that rivals ""The French Connection.""","63","112864"
"9616","Has strong performances and stirring football scenes.","63","878804"
"9617","The dark nihilism of Sicario masks a reliance on easier solutions, ones we’ve been fed by decades of genre films and that feed our need for justice dispensed with violent, vengeful directness. The movie promises to clear the fetid air around the drug wars. In the end it’s just another drug.","63","3397884"
"9618","Through it all, Washington’s stillness is emphasized, so much so that the film slows down just to make sure we appreciate the presence and the talent behind it.","63","455944"
"9619","A film that has some promising elements and which often seems as if it is on the verge of evolving into something wonderful but never quite manages to turn that particular corner.","63","1979388"
"9620","The film delivers the goods, reptile-wise. Though the computer-generated villains look a bit clumsy at ground level, they're superb in the air.","63","253556"
"9621","In physiological shorthand, Mr. Holland's Opus is a very large and very insistent reflex hammer applied to the ducts instead of the knees. [19 Jan 1996, p.03]","63","113862"
"9622","Sensitively performed and laced with some forceful quotidian grit, the film evades the larger questions behind a scandalous shooting death.","63","2334649"
"9623","If you loved Wolfe's book, you may very well hate the movie. If you simply liked the novel, you may be simultaneously entertained and disappointed by what De Palma and Cristofer have done to it. If you don't know the book, you may find the movie mildly enjoyable, while wondering what all the fuss is about. [21 Dec 1990, p.3]","63","99165"
"9624","Unknown is never boring, and Collet-Serra mostly keeps up a lively pace, but he doesn't do the movie any favors with the flat, dull way he films the scene in which we finally learn what's going on.","63","1401152"
"9625","Affleck, who has struggled in real life with alcoholism and has been in and out of rehab on a number of occasions over the years, makes his character’s pain palpable and totally believable.","63","8544498"
"9626","Brit hunk Alex Pettyfer has grown into a solid and quite interesting lead to build this potential sci-fi movie series around.","63","1464540"
"9627","A portrait of the eve of 2008's financial crisis that plays out withfunereal inevitability, Margin Call loves speechifying, but the film is farmore assured when lingering in the silence of its morally compromisedcharacters.","63","1615147"
"9628","Doesn't have its heroine's conviction. It'd be better if it had.","63","408790"
"9629","There are fitful sparks between him (Kutcher) and Portman, but he is unable to sustain viewer interest in his character. She becomes the dominant figure and that throws off No Strings Attached's balance and impacts the all-important chemistry.","63","1411238"
"9630","It is an exploitation picture disguised as a hipster comedy.","63","86979"
"9631","When remaking a popular film, you must remember this: First, do no harm to the original. Arthur accomplishes this, with Russell Brand slurring his way neatly through the title role.","63","1334512"

"9633","Farhadi navigates his complicated narrative thicket with an apparent ease that confirms yet again that he's an amazing talent, but here he isn't able to blend the brushstrokes as he has in prior films.","63","2404461"
"9634","Jon Voight, Burt Reynolds and, indeed, all the members of the cast are finely tuned and very good. What the movie totally fails at, however, is its attempt to make some kind of significant statement about its action.","63","68473"
"9635","Alba is a showstopper in a fringed cowgirl outfit. But nine years wiser, we know that pretty things aren’t always worth killing for.","63","458481"
"9636","“King Redux” has just a couple of more laughs than the first Disney cartoon, but being 30 minutes longer, that’s not much of a plus. The original vs. remake comparison is hard to get away from here, but I have to say I was moved just once by this remake — that lovely opening note of African song/chant still thrills.","63","6105098"

"9642","In their best films, the Coens mine the depths of loneliness and egotism and frailty and solipsism. But in THE BALLAD OF BUSTER SCRUGGS there's a noticeable lack of deeper insinuation, a lack of curiosity.","63","6412452"
"9643","Equal parts “The Crucible,” “Kill Bill” and well, hell — “Carrie” — Assassination Nation is straight up action exploitation, a scantily clad, sexed-up slut-shamed girls satire about scantily clad, sexed-up and slut-shamed girls who get even.","63","6205872"
"9644","A showcase for Vince Vaughn's rantings and Owen Wilson's standard but affable chum act.","63","396269"
"9645","Death Sentence would be right at home as one half of ""Grindhouse""'s B-movie double bill.","63","804461"
"9646","Like Midnight Express, for which Stone received an Academy Award for his screenplay adaptation, Salvador is better movie than document. But if Stone's style is entirely too florid for history, it is grimly arresting by Hollywood standards. Whatever else, Salvador is an original. [9 May 1986, p.D1]","63","91886"
"9647","H20 is the second-best entry into the series, and, although it's nowhere close to the level established by Carpenter's classic, it avoids the excesses that ruin many would-be horror movies.","63","120694"
"9648","Actually a marked improvement over the plodding and confusing original.","63","790686"
"9649","Coppola lacks a firm grip on this material, and it starts to get away from her midway through.","63","335266"
"9650","When the secrets of David's circumstances and motives start spilling into the daylight along with more and more blood, The Guest does a strange thing. It becomes flat-footed and a bit dull.","63","2980592"
"9651","In Okja, a transporting protest fantasy becomes another shrill dust-up in the waging of the culture wars.","63","3967856"
"9652","The movie is dramatically limp, running out of narrative steam long before the set decorator runs out of colours.","63","120879"
"9653","A supremely silly movie, which means that it has moments of boring idiocy mixed with moments of inspired hilarity.","63","129387"
"9654","Secretariat ultimately delivers where it matters, in the home stretch.","63","1028576"
"9655","At best it's a bit like Mel Brooks' ""The History of the World Part I"" (except Ramis stops somewhere in Genesis); at worst it's like a Scary Movie-type parody of John Huston's ""The Bible.""","63","1045778"
"9656","The film's searching images counterpoint the hyper-articulate methodology of its characters' sense of imbalance and uncertainty.","63","2543164"
"9657","It's an adequate superhero yarn, but, hopefully, it's not the best of the burgeoning genre that 2003 has to offer.","63","287978"
"9658","On the plus side, there are these super-scary mechanical octopus-type things with a billion eyes and metal tentacles that fly in great awful swarms and look like the non-organic versions of the flying-brain-and-spinal-cord monsters that made the otherwise laughable '60s sci-fi flick ""Fiend Without aFace"" so cool.","63","242653"
"9659","Monsters University is a prequel that is far more conventional, not nearly as witty or clever as that original.","63","1453405"
"9660","That's kind of the overall problem of Ocean's 8. It's all predicated on the fact that women are often underestimated. But in making that point, it's also somehow underestimated the audience who still should be entitled to a smart, fun heist, no matter who is pulling it off.","63","5164214"
"9661","Conventional but never sanctimonious, it balances out its familiar recovery angle with a healthy measure of sardonic wit.","63","790636"
"9662","Rosamund Pike is perfection as Barney's true love, and Dustin Hoffman makes magic as Barney's randy dad. It's acting heaven.","63","1423894"
"9663","Zellweger shows flashes of her Oscar winning talent and is certainly not past her sell-by date, even if she’s tampered entirely too much with the packaging.","63","1473832"
"9664","Like ""Trek V,"" this would be merely an interesting episode on a TV series, but it would move faster. On the big screen, even with the snazzy ship, credibly sized crew and good special effects, it plods in spots. [6 Dec. 1991, p.15]","63","102975"
"9665","An ""intelligent"" action film, because it presents the viewer with an opportunity to puzzle things out rather than sit mindlessly and watch people get blown to pieces.","63","100802"
"9666","This time out, writer and director Mark Steven Johnson has bounced back with a movie so full of camp spirit it should come with tents and a marshmallow roast.","63","259324"

"9669","If only the movie had the courage to be as gonzo as it wants to be!","63","3631112"
"9670","Director Fred Walton (When a Stranger Calls) cheats shamelessly to effect the various surprises, but has so much of that ""who-is-next?"" tension going for him that the movie more or less makes itself. [01 Apr 1986, p.D9]","63","90655"
"9671","The most interesting personality in Ed Wood is not the title character, but Bela Lugosi. So covered up with makeup that he's barely recognizable, Martin Landau gives a deeply-felt performance -- a eerie and stunning recreation of a man haunted by lost fame.","63","109707"
"9672","Truth also ignores Rather’s famous showboating, pettiness and hubris. He’s worked in lower-profile gigs since, but trust me, there’s a good reason why no news organization will touch Mapes with a 10-foot pole.","63","3859076"
"9673","The movie keeps you watching and, at times, even gripped for more than an hour. But, at the end, it leaves us feeling detached and underwhelmed.","63","286106"
"9674","With an ace pop mechanic like Joel Schumacher now in charge of our hero's bruised psyche, the patient not only survives but thrives in the garishly garnished but never groaningly gruesome Batman Forever. [16 Jun 1995, Pg.01.D]","63","112462"

"9676","We never know them as characters, particularly father figure Fish, because screenwriters Irena Brignull and Adam Pava have them speak an un-translated, Jawa-Gollum gibberish, not English.","63","787474"
"9677","The most refreshing performance is by Mortensen.","63","119173"
"9678","One appreciates the desire of the filmmaker to let the audience fill in the back story, but Rasmussen’s behavior reflects badly on the Danish and heightens sympathy for the POWs.","63","3841424"
"9679","It’s filmic fool’s gold, as every scene that doesn’t sparkle is just dirt -- dank, gritty visuals, murky plotting and very bad line-readings from Troyer (Mini-Me from the Austin Powers movies).","63","1054606"
"9680","Heathers was such a black-comic revelation that Pump Up the Volume comes as a double surprise. What were the odds, particularly this early in his career, that Christian Slater would end up starring in two of the best high school movies ever? [22 Aug 1990, p.4D]","63","100436"
"9681","What makes Blade 2 marginally better than ""Blade,"" especially if you thought the first was a hollow spectacle? It has a plot.","63","187738"
"9682","It starts pushing buttons immediately and never lets up. This proves to be both its strongest asset and, unfortunately, its biggest flaw.","63","283632"
"9683","It's a chick flick with a likable premise.","63","892318"
"9684","It’s not a reinvention of the genre, but it is a fairly engrossing variation on a theme. And that’s in large part due to the violence — sexual and otherwise — it recreates.","63","4080956"
"9685","City Island is a light “family” romance that goes about as far as its novel location -- an island neighborhood tucked in the middle of New York City -- and a good cast can carry it.","63","1174730"
"9686","At its best, Stan & Ollie shows how the private and personal dimensions of art are achingly inseparable.","63","3385524"
"9687","Luckily, Trumbo has a powerhouse Bryan Cranston to light a fire under the moldier clichés in John McNamara's script.","63","3203606"
"9688","For all the fresh originality of the first half, why do we have to retread Kubrick’s film again? Leashing the film adaptation so closely to Kubrick’s film is a missed opportunity for this story to realize the full mystical potential promised.","63","5606664"
"9689","Kalifornia is disturbing, and, while it doesn't overdo the blood, neither is the violence understated.","63","107302"
"9690","Niccol is too good a screenwriter (The Truman Show, Gattaca) not to know that Hollywood cliches are hell on a film's political bite. They muzzle it.","63","399295"
"9691","The Greatest Showman is, like the singing, dancing, versatile actor who stars in it, larger than life. And if this is the only screen musical we can get out of the last of his peak performing years, it’ll do.","63","1485796"
"9692","With moments of mind-bending creepiness, the film has potential, but eventually it devolves into merely a head-scratcher.","63","309698"
"9693","Bill Murray's manic performance is the main selling point of this mildly amusing farce about a psychiatrist with a patient who literally drives him crazy","63","103241"
"9694","Yet, for all that's wrong here, one thing is wonderfully, blissfully right, and his name is Tom Hanks.","63","109830"
"9695","Uniformly excellent performances keep this destabilizing tale ticking, yet one can't help wishing Hollywood had combined this cast and these timely themes with a little bit of imagination to come up with something fresh.","63","368008"
"9696","The film is surprisingly amiable, thanks to the commitment of its lead actors and its refusal to condescend to its characters.","63","4501244"
"9697","This surprisingly sentimental science-fiction thriller boasts enough fresh twists to satisfy time-travel junkies.","63","186151"
"9698","I enjoyed a lot of A Star Is Born. I thought Miss Streisand was distractingly miscast in the role, and yet I forgave her everything when she sang.","63","75265"
"9699","A hymn to that beautiful city, is among his least consequential efforts. It's attractive and easy to slip into, but he didn't put enough thought into the design, and it soon falls apart.","63","1605783"
"9700","What he forgot to ask Woody [Allen] for was the keen insight into middle-class folkways that marks the best Allen pictures. [28 July 1989, Arts, p.10]","63","98635"
"9701","Once you get past the intriguing fact that although Whip's job puts hundreds of lives into his hands on a daily basis yet he's cavalier about protecting them, the movie doesn't feel much different than any other exploration of addiction.","63","1907668"
"9702","Burlesque is a preposterous and intermittently entertaining lesson in how to make a movie musical with a little brains and a lot of talent.","63","1126591"
"9703","Vol. 2 isn't exactly disappointing, and like all of Tarantino's movies, I suspect it will improve with repeated viewings. But for now, Vol. 2 leaves you pondering what could have been.","63","378194"
"9704","Has the incoherent look of a movie thrown together by a committee whose members weren't on the same page.","63","229260"
"9705","The martial-arts sequences take this prosaic thriller to a higher level.","63","238380"
"9706","From its title on down, An Officer and a Gentleman (at the Plaza) is both a thoroughly rousing crowd-pleaser and a shamelessly manipulative banner-waver, a homage to the never-practiced ethics of a non-existent era. [28 Jul 1982]","63","84434"
"9707","Unfortunately, this is also among the weakest of the early Bond films, although Connery is in peak form.","63","62512"
"9708","About two faces of healing.","63","120646"
"9709","I can't help thinking, though, that maybe Thornton was too ambitious in trying to wear three hats.","63","117666"
"9710","The film takes the form but not the feel of a comic thriller. It's quirkier than that.","63","119229"
"9711","It seems as if almost everybody in this fascinating artifact has a megaphone at some point, even Bogdanovich, doing his Jimmy Cagney impression, maybe a little Tennessee Williams, quoting Welles’ beloved Bard in line that gives the entire enterprise its one truly poignant moment. “Our revels now are ended.”","63","69049"
"9712","Gerwig is a magnetic actress, but it feels as if she’s overplaying it here. Even in Brooke’s best moments, she’s not all that charming or interesting.","63","2872462"
"9713","Jerzy Kosinski's witty but slim novel was based on a witty but thin conceit, and Hal Ashby's film of that novel is equally witty, equally thin. [09 Feb 1980]","63","78841"
"9714","A fairly competent recycling of familiar ingredients, given an additional interest because of Harrison Ford's personal appeal.","63","118571"
"9715","There are several painfully awkward ""dead spots"" in Mallrats where nothing works -- not the dialogue, the acting, or the direction.","63","113749"
"9716","Though Breakin' follows the Flashdance formula as if it were blazed in concrete, working from a script that would make a 12-year-old snicker, it is so exuberant and lighthearted that it works. [09 May 1984, p.B5]","63","86998"
"9717","In its way Campion’s film is a thing of beauty, but its characters’ inner lives must be taken on faith.","63","810784"
"9718","Only Marisa Tomei’s face can compete with Isabelle Huppert’s ability to turn even the sappiest of scenarios into a nuanced tour de force.","63","8019694"
"9719","The film's not as good as its cast, but The Way, Way Back has its moments.","63","1727388"
"9720","The message in Spanglish is thoughtful and astute; it's the delivery that could use some work.","63","371246"
"9721","I didn't feel strongly one way or another about The Kings of Summer. It's too innocuous to actively dislike but there's nothing memorable here. The characters are bland; the comedy, while occasionally eliciting laughs, is lukewarm; and the relationships never gel.","63","2179116"
"9722","As charming as Baby Driver strives to be, the appeal starts to curdle once Wright makes his fetishistic aims clear.","63","3890160"
"9723","The transformation of a teen into a serial killer isn't credible compared to the portrait of idle suburban adolescence.","63","5112578"
"9724","Sadly, Herge isn't around to see The Adventures of Tintin, Spielberg's crisp, richly rendered animated adaptation, which could be counted as both a success and a failure. Spielberg has brought Tintin to the big screen all right, but not quite to life.","63","983193"
"9725","The movie takes paranoia to a far edge. And some audiences will admire it simply because it doesn't waste time on the normality it's going to end up subverting-because it's more fixated on its pods than its people. [25 Feb 1994, p.C]","63","106452"
"9726","Fans will cheer at Schumacher's faithful inflation of Webber's vision, which interprets all that pomp and bombast as if the show were some sort of overblown Vegas attraction.","63","293508"
"9727","For the most part, Michael Winterbottom's well-intended film, the true story of an idealistic journalist and his gallant wife disinvites emotion by focusing on process at the expense of passion.","63","829459"
"9728","Despite broad satire about racism and border fences that will appeal to some liberals, the movie doesn't line up neatly along party lines -- except in that other sense of the word ""party."" It's a movie that just wants to have fun.","63","985694"
"9729","It's all in the telling. Gruen provided grit and pungent detail. The movie settles for gloss.","63","1067583"
"9730","As About Alex moves toward its conclusion, it devolves into some plot resolutions that were a lot less predictable back in the ’80s.","63","2667918"
"9731","Some kind of mess...terpiece.","63","418279"
"9732","The action epic 300 is so overblown, overheated and over the top that on some level, it's fun to get caught up in the operatic dizziness of it.","63","416449"
"9733","At least hits a certain adrenaline level, and the stunts have panache. If you crave the ''Young Guns'' approach to the Old West, here it is again.","63","244000"
"9734","I was shaken, but not stirred, by Babel, a globalist melodrama that careens from Morocco to Mexico like a revved-up ""Crash.""","63","449467"
"9735","Taken by itself, it’s thought-provoking enough to pass muster. Get “Get Out” out of your head, because truly, all Peele’s two thrillers have in common is hype.","63","6857112"
"9736","The remake has a superior caper but less chemistry.","63","155267"
"9737","Just as John Carpenter seems to generate box-office smashes incidentally to his search for intriguing shades of blue, Miller is so enthused with his camera angles that the movie has ended before he's aware there's only 20 lines of dialogue in it and not a single character better defined than Max's mutt. [22 May 1982]","63","82694"
"9738","The highlight is a meta touch: A funny on-screen résumé is posted each time we meet a new character.","63","426459"
"9739","For much of the film, this is very funny and fairly original stuff, though Submarine starts to run aground about the time that Jordana and Oliver's relationship does.","63","1440292"
"9740","Even after the plot has left you behind, you still watch The Brothers Bloom with a smile, because the actors are so engaging.","63","844286"
"9741","There is one hilarious sight gag involving prophylactics, and one can't argue with the film's sobering message, but otherwise Ritter's character is mostly a bore. [3 March 1989, p.A]","63","98343"
"9742","Take the theatrical flourish away from this story, however, and the story's thinness becomes apparent.","63","1568911"
"9743","If you want to see “Force Majeure,” rent it and stream it. If you want to see two terrific comic talents circling around it in something lighter and funnier, then Downhill it is.","63","4558376"
"9744","Of course, this is social satire and some bits are very funny...but the message is too obvious and the humour too gentle for the whole affair not to feel like so much white male whining.","63","5884230"
"9745","One thing's clear: R.J. Reynolds won't be showing Constantine at the company picnic any time soon.","63","360486"
"9746","Although it too often succumbs to the kind of whimsical sentimentality about the mentally ill that has afflicted movies from King of Hearts to The Fisher King, this filmed-in-Spokane comedy-drama is almost salvaged by its excellent cast. [16 Apr 1993, p.3]","63","106387"
"9747","A frolic that keeps tripping over its own gorgeous feet.","63","1486190"
"9748","Superman III is the kind of movie I feared the original ""Superman"" would be. It's a cinematic comic book, shallow, silly, filled with stunts and action, without much human interest.","63","86393"
"9749","Jenkins is a master of cinematic portraiture, but he’s so captivated by the magic of a moment — even a single image, like cigarette smoke swirling around one of Fonny’s carved-wood sculptures — that he sometimes forgets he’s got an audience expecting a plot.","63","7125860"
"9750","Though it starts slowly, it lumbers toward greatness in the last third and restores him [Lucas] briefly to the top of his class.","63","121766"
"9751","With its twist, the movie leaps into a fresh realm of fantasy. But director Marc Forster and first-time screenwriter Zach Helm don't know what to do when they get there, and the film's greatest asset almost becomes its undoing.","63","420223"
"9752","In The Conspirator, Wright announces in no uncertain terms that she is back and more than ready for her close-up.","63","968264"
"9753","Richard Jewell is a sincere and extremely well-acted irritant from 89-year-old director Clint Eastwood. It’s destined to get under the hides of different moviegoers in radically different ways.","63","3513548"
"9754","The difference between Niels Arden Oplev's adaptation of Stieg Larsson's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and David Fincher's own is not, as some might have hoped, the difference between night and day, but between curdled milk and a warmed-over holiday second.","63","1568346"
"9755","The plot finds loopholes as it rambles ahead semi-plausibly to its conclusion. Audiences will no doubt applaud this entertaining film, but the case is under appeal.","63","6000478"
"9756","Rather than confront what it sets up, it takes the one joke and runs - till it runs out of steam.","63","84805"
"9757","A tough movie to love.","63","1399683"
"9758","Gram Parsons' last rites were among the most extra­ordinary in rock history. Too bad this retelling of the singer's final adventure is so tame.","63","338075"
"9759","Good, clean genre entertainment, the sort of harmless yet endearing brand of moviemaking seemingly unattainable in today's Hollywood system.","63","1525366"
"9760","There's so much flashing forward and backward, so many spins of fate, so many chapters in the journals, that after awhile I felt that I, as well as time, was being jerked around.","63","289879"
"9761","Sexy, stylish, and legitimately suspenseful.","63","364045"
"9762","A tighter version of the same story might have captured and held my interest, but this one had the proceedings wandering like the riderless camels in the desert.","63","240510"
"9763","Vaughn and Favreau are a dynamite pair, and there's enough give-and-take between them to satisfy any diehard ""Swingers"" fan.","63","227005"
"9764","The porn industry of the era is as much a part of the movie as the classic cars (re-used in the background, in scene after scene) and the leisure suits. But the zingers, which fall off markedly in the latter third when the energy flags and the plot unravels, always pack a punch.","63","3799694"
"9765","Unlike ""Caché"" and ""Code: Unknown,"" where Haneke's investigations into societal and spiritual despair resonated with poetic force, The White Ribbon doesn't resonate at all.","63","1149362"
"9766","Rushmore is one of those films that's so inconsequential that its memory threatens to fade away before the end credits have finished rolling.","63","128445"
"9767","With her high forehead, pale eyebrows and solemn face, Stiles could have understudied Cate Blanchett as Elizabeth -- another dignified smart girl surrounded by conniving idiots.","63","147800"
"9768","Wildly uneven collage of effects and live action is no Disney-bland vision of dreams gone bonkers. There's enough Freudian material to reupholster a thousand therapy couches.","63","166276"
"9769","In its clumsy way, it throws in comments now and then to show it knows the difference between Arab terrorists and American citizens.","63","133952"
"9770","By any other standard, the creatures in Monsters, Inc. would be impressive. But by the high standard Pixar not only set itself, but invented, they're only ordinary.","63","198781"
"9771","It's a treat because, making no apologies for the source material, director Guillermo del Toro lets his picture gorge on power bars of pop energy, sugared with sprinkles of playful humour, and, at least twice, laced with a visual style so piercingly keen that horror morphs into beauty. Not bad for a pulpy outing.","63","167190"
"9772","The frantic pleasures of this film add up to what used to be considered good fun; good Saturday morning fun; good Saturday morning fun to eat pancakes and pour maple syrup by; good fun that, once the day begins, is good fun soon forgotten. It's a pity Flash Gordon can't be screened at the breakfast table. [6 Dec 1980, p.E7]","63","80745"
"9773","The acting is its chief strength. Russell Crowe brings a cocky charisma to Ben Wade.","63","381849"
"9774","It works too hard to keep matters on an even, we're-all-more-alike-than-different keel, which is just one part of its chief problem of forcefully conveying information and intent.","63","1535109"
"9775","As it is, it's a passable diversion.","63","429493"
"9776","It's a fine line between interesting characters and ""Northern Exposure"" quirk, but the movie mostly stays on the right side of it.","63","2091473"
"9777","This is an eerie, inventively mounted movie: It's a shivery fun time, filled with dark corners, deserted hallways and sudden apparitions. But it never manages to genuinely rattle you.","63","391198"
"9778","Screenwriter John Hughes, making his directing debut, is at his best when he empathizes with the sensitivity in the ugly-duckling Ringwald and Hall characters. [04 May 1984]","63","88128"
"9779","When it works - and it doesn't half the time - it's as if Monty Python were back, putting its merrily imbecilic stamp on the dark world of terrorism.","63","1341167"
"9780","Jonze lets the magic ebb away in a sorry mesh of strained relationships.","63","386117"
"9781","The film version of Memoirs of a Geisha is very like a geisha itself: a thing of exquisitely refined surfaces beneath which beats an ordinary heart.","63","397535"
"9782","Bailed out by a few good jolts, Jurassic World gets by, barely, as a marauding-dinosaurs narrative designed for a more jaded audience than the one ""Jurassic Park"" conquered back in 1993.","63","369610"
"9783","Perhaps the greatest strength of Star Trek: The Motion Picture is that, despite a badly-paced middle, it boasts a strong beginning and end.","63","79945"
"9784","The film’s cool-looking desaturated look (not unlike “The Road”), plentiful action and Washington’s charismatic gravitas as the taciturn hero make it relatively easy to overlook the pretensions and implausibilities in the script.","63","1037705"
"9785","Individual scenes work, but the movie seems overstuffed-why is the Harris character necessary-and halting.","63","105695"
"9786","The skies are thick with whizzing bullets and strings being pulled by Shane Black's crude script and Richard Donner's cement-mixer direction. Predictably, the chicks-and-ammo stuff is punctuated by TV cop show repartee. [6 Mar 1987, p.36]","63","93409"
"9787","With danger in every woods, elevator and hospital corridor, Joel Schumacher's by-rote direction will likely give audiences what they want: slick, superficial escapism with casting punch - ironically, virtues associated with the current flop I Love Trouble. To its credit, The Client moves faster and adds suspense, but ultimately seems as negligible. [20 July 1994, p.1D]","63","109446"
"9788","The Descendants is a soap opera with Hawaiian shirts.","63","1033575"
"9789","What sets Heathers apart from less intelligent teenage movies is that it has a point of view toward this subject matter - a bleak, macabre and bitingly satirical one.","63","97493"
"9790","The picture, intelligent but mild, has more of a 10-volt hum than a true spark.","63","1839492"
"9791","Mulan is another competent effort, but it's a disappointment for anyone hoping the studio would raise the standard of the animated feature to a new level.","63","120762"
"9792","Historians might demand a little more history from Elizabeth: The Golden Age. But soap opera loyalists could hardly ask for more soap.","63","414055"
"9793","Won't make you forget Kidman's better work, but it's not a film you long to excise from your memory.","63","188453"
"9794","The film swings from melodrama to sermonizing, both blunting the human drama that needs to come to the fore.","63","896872"
"9795","The movie’s fun to watch, but you can tell it was a lot more fun to make, and that’s a problem. The party stays up on the screen; down here, it’s been over for a year.","63","1130080"
"9796","Scarlett Johansson looks lovely and hasn't much to do besides that, McGregor only starts having fun when he's playing the ""original"" of his clone.","63","399201"
"9797","While the rush toward a conventional climax is confusing, and more than a little disappointing, there's an undeniable pleasure that emerges in seeing Tarantino juggle the dynamite of his ideas, even when they prematurely pop off in his face.","63","1853728"
"9798","It wallows queasily in its high-tech violence and is woefully anti-climactic; if you think director Kathryn Bigelow doesn't know when to quit, just think back to her sky-diving folly Point Break. The audio-visual ka-boom here befits James Cameron's producing-writing co-credits, but little else justifies Days' prime Saturday-Sunday slot in the New York Film Festival. [6 Oct 1995, p.4D]","63","114558"
"9799","Shanley demonstrates a fresh, giddy talent for visualizing his eccentric comedy ideas. [9 Mar 1990, p.20]","63","99892"
"9800","The movie moves, but it doesn't breathe.","63","1371155"
"9801","The film's ruefully honest tone is periodically drowned out by the blare of stagey coincidences.","63","3714720"
"9802","There's really nothing wrong with the movie; it delivers exactly what Arnold's audience wants, but I'm not part of that crowd. I'm tired of jungle fights and creatures with weird fangs. [12 June 1987, p.A]","63","93773"
"9803","Catch offers mild fun but never as much as its animated '60s-retro opening credits portend. They're the cutest of the year.","63","264464"
"9804","Only occasionally does Fresnadillo rise above the mundane, but, to his credit, the exceptions are worth savouring.","63","463854"
"9805","The movie adds up to one of the smartest and most ambitious political thrillers in years. But if you find a more difficult movie to follow this year, it will be in Mandarin without subtitles.","63","365737"
"9806","Truth is, Idaho is nothing but set pieces; tossed into a mix whose meaning is almost certainly private. [27 Sept 1991]","63","102494"
"9807","The movie resembles a video game in which each victory whisks you to the next level, with slightly different antagonists and a faster pace.","63","209163"
"9808","It’s a sidewinding but often effective L.A. crime thriller saddled with the wrong leading man.","63","1259528"
"9809","It’s counting on your amnesia to the past, on screen and off, and it will readily supply you with two hours of mindless escape. It does the job better than most, thanks largely to its hulking hero.","63","5758778"
"9810","It tells a well-crafted story; the new characters are invigorating; the old characters are reintroduced tidily. But it is also far too enamoured with the power of its own history.","63","2488496"
"9811","The sequel's not bad; it's not slovenly. Some of the jolts are effectively staged and filmed, and Wan is getting better and better at figuring out what to do with the camera, and maneuvering actors within a shot for maximum suspense, while letting his design collaborators do the rest. But Leigh Whannell's script is a bit of a jumble.","63","2226417"
"9812","As Westerns go, Silverado delivers elaborate gun-fighting scenes, legions of galloping horses, stampeding cattle, a box canyon, covered wagons, tons of creaking leather and even a High Noonish duel. How it manages to run the gamut of cowboy movie elements without getting smart-alecky is intriguing. But on the important issues, like real character development, Silverado flakes apart. [10 Jul 1985, p.52]","63","90022"
"9813","The movie meanders without a rudimentary sense of the dramatic, yet it remains intermittently interesting thanks to a surprisingly voluminous cast of usual suspects from the world of independent cinema. [14 Aug 1996 Pg.09.D]","63","115632"
"9814","One of the great unanswered questions in Hollywood is how Chevy Chase still gets work. Although his appeal is not as incomprehensible as that of, say, Pauly Shore, it's not obvious, either; ""range"" is one word no one will ever use in conjunction with Chase's acting ability.","63","97958"
"9815","There's a loose, vérité vibe here, and times when both Williams and Gosling root down deep to deliver something resonant and true. But this modern-day kitchen sink drama is ultimately too painful, too labored, to care much about at all.","63","1120985"
"9816","Hip, lurid and improbably lovable, The Guard is easily the best guy-love comedy of the summer, with Cheadle and Gleeson's riffs and repartee tumbling back and forth as if they've been trading lies over Guinness forever.","63","1540133"
"9817","Even though it does so through a dull and talky haze of cigar smoke, it is always Gary Oldman’s phenomenal performance that keeps the film airborne.","63","4555426"
"9818","Even at his worst - and Robert does some awful things - the actor almost makes you root for him, hoping he'll get away with it.","63","1764183"
"9819","Human Nature's zigzag ingenuity wears out some time before the farce bounces slowly to an uneven conclusion. For all its highfalutin title and corkscrew narrative, the movie turns out to be not much more than a shaggy human tale.","63","219822"
"9820","This thin premise is better suited to a half-hour sitcom than a feature film (in fact, there's an episode of Frasier with a very similar setup).","63","800039"
"9821","A curious blend of our newly acquired taste for dystopia alongside a healthy sprinkling of Lord of the Flies, the film offers familiar pleasures without prompting the sense of having already been here before.","63","1790864"
"9822","Mamet's movie has its moments of wit and warmth, but here he's mostly behind, not ahead of, the curve.","63","120202"
"9823","It's blunt, to the point, aggressively manipulative and, at 86 minutes, not a minute longer than it needs to be.","63","351977"
"9824","Does the script by William Nicholson sometimes hit the sentiment pedal too hard? It does. But look at the tale it's telling.","63","5716464"
"9825","Dr. Furter is played by a British actor named Tim Curry, who bears a certain resemblance to Loretta Young in drag. He's the best thing in the movie, maybe because he seems to be having the most fun.","63","73629"
"9826","Not super, but not bad, the teen comedy, Superbad, is another comic dance across the hormonal minefield of late high school.","63","829482"
"9827","Not one to overstay its welcome, this suspenseful tale is an economic exercise in delivering the goods for those who are interested in a two-fisted Liam Neeson vehicle to soak up, bask in, and then leave behind as soon as it's over.","63","936501"
"9828","Trekkers will be pleased by new characters and stunning special effects.","63","120844"
"9829","It's a pretty entertaining, extremely good-looking cinematic blip--not important, not outstanding, but better than a lot of PG stuff that attempts to reach both parents and their 8-year-old kids.","63","167456"
"9830","A bit of a tweener, neither triumph nor disaster, a war-games fantasy with a use-by date of Nov. 22, when the new ""Hunger Games"" movie comes out.","63","1731141"
"9831","Just cute enough for some tastes, too cute by half for others.","63","1532503"
"9832","This is Eastwood's ""Brokeback Mountain,"" chased by a healthy serving of ""J.F.K.""- style paranoia and conspiracies (Oliver Stone is going to love this movie.) But because so much of what the film says about Hoover remains speculative and unproven, J. Edgar can't fully cross all its Ts.","63","1616195"
"9833","The craftsmanship is impeccable as is the acting, but the storytelling is where the movie falls down.","63","1423995"
"9834","With an all-star cast maintaining an amiable tone throughout, the result is a movie in which everyone should see themselves for at least a few minutes (and wish they were that young, that beautiful and that well-off).","63","1001508"
"9835","The cast is proficient, with Balk especially adroit at giving her demonic gifts a gleeful twist. And director Andrew Fleming keeps the special effects on a low boil, effective yet not ostentatious, while taking allusive advantage of the competing (and sometimes complementing) tension between the school's Catholic imagery and the girl's pagan icons. But as our heroines lose their grip, so does he. [03 May 1996]","63","115963"
"9836","Moderately funny though immoderately derivative.","63","1001526"
"9837","Like ""Born To Be Blue,"" Miles Ahead is allergic to all things biopic, especially the cheap psychology and the effort to tie up a complex life with a neat bow.","63","790770"
"9838","Marginally worth seeing if you're a Pacino fan but, even then, waiting for the DVD is the smart bet.","63","417217"
"9839","This PG-rated movie feels safe and constricted in a way the story never does on the page. It leaves out the deep magic of a good movie, or a good sermon: the feeling that something vital is at stake.","63","363771"
"9840","The most interesting dimension of Altered States has to be the way Russell sexualizes Eddie’s relationship with godly figures, most notably symbols of Jesus, crucifixion, and his father.","63","80360"
"9841","The movie unreels like a depressive in a manic phase, a frenzy of lightning-fast cuts, cuts, cuts.","63","119116"
"9842","Tusk is a mesmerizing mess that will make Joe Popcorn yak. Jay and Silent Bob will love it.","63","3099498"
"9843","All too often the plot feels calculated rather than organic, the result of a time-tested formula rather than genuine innovation.","63","1650062"
"9844","Cruder than the original, Aliens is a distinctly greedy mega-production.","63","90605"
"9845","Lacks the spark of the best recent Disney spectaculars, like ""Beauty and the Beast.""","63","118617"
"9846","Novitiate is very much a mixed-bag of a movie, condemned by the fanatic at The Catholic Legion of Decency, but too revealing and realistic to discard outright, too heartfelt to fail to move, at times.","63","4513316"
"9847","Whatever its cultural significance, it’s just passable entertainment, a noble attempt at waxing mythical that never, for one second, delivers that out-of-body giddiness that makes popcorn pictures of its ilk burst to life.","63","1825683"
"9848","Yet the film's most serious flaw (next to a newly concocted fizz-out ending) is that it's not sinister enough. [30 Jun 1993 Pg. 01.D]","63","106918"
"9849","Her star billing notwithstanding, Jolie has perhaps the ninth-largest part in the movie (behind seven humans and a dog), playing Cage's ex-girlfriend.","63","187078"
"9850","This is Austen as chick-lit, not too deep, but with some integrity and the worthy goal of reaching a younger audience by offering a starch-free version of the story.","63","414387"
"9851","Take away Bruce Willis and this is straight-to-video material.","63","337978"
"9852","The literalizing of Ivan Locke's hidden self and his inability to master it ultimately exposes the film as the squarest kind of theater: drama therapy.","63","2692904"
"9853","The movie's basic message is that lying and conniving are perfectly all right - as long as you're a swell person inside, like the pert character we're watching here. Working Girl is a fun movie in many ways - don't get me wrong. [25 Jan 1989, Arts, p.11]","63","96463"
"9854","The movie isn't badly done, just overdone - a cozy art-house crowd-pleaser coasting on the expectations of its genre.","63","1504320"
"9855","Has the sentiment and sweetness of a good coming-of-age movie but lacks the drive and pulse that makes for a great rock and roll movie.","63","181875"
"9856","Knows when to take itself seriously and when to laugh at itself -- even if its audience isn't laughing along at every gag.","63","267913"
"9857","For folks like me, who missed ""Firefly,"" the short-lived TV show on which the movie's based, watching Serenity is like showing up for a big lecture course at the end of the semester. And yet, after an hour of intense disorientation, the movie's arch sarcasm becomes oddly entertaining.","63","379786"
"9858","The near-surgical precision with which Yorgos Lanthimos approaches the most surreal of conceits turns out to be a double-edged sword.","63","3464902"
"9859","Excellent in flashes, unintentionally absurd and lead-footed at other moments, the movie stumbles under the weight of its own grandiose intentions.","63","120586"
"9860","Invention - a mash-up of two Jim Carrey comedies, ""Liar Liar"" and ""Bruce Almighty"" - flirts with being a one-gag pony. Shocking sincerity loses its comic impact after a while.","63","1058017"
"9861","The film is at its best when it’s about the bond between the women, but it’s a theme that doesn’t hit home until far too late.","63","5503686"
"9862","Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet do exactly what’s asked of them as Frank and April Wheeler, who may be ironically named: They spin emotional wheels constantly but get nowhere.","63","959337"
"9863","Avengers: Endgame is nothing if not the crowd-pleasingest crowd-pleaser in recent cinema history...Give everybody, and I do mean EVERYbody, a curtain call.","63","4154796"
"9864","Training Day has the best performances and worst third act of any movie you're likely to see this year.","63","139654"
"9865","Nine to Five is a film full or surprises - some pleasant, other disappointing. The most pleasant surprise is the appearance of Dolly Parton, who with this one film establishes herself as a thoroughly engaging movie star. The biggest disappointment is that this Jane Fonda comedy about a trio of secretaries out to get their boss doesn't have more bite. [19 Dec 1980, p.2-1]","63","80319"
"9866","The good-hearted Galaxy Quest delivers fun and confusion in equal measure, as it gently tweaks the fanaticism of ""Star Trek""/""Star Wars"" fans while validating it at the same time.","63","177789"
"9867","The Bling Ring is the cinematic equivalent of the vapid, superficial kids it features — all visual panache and minimal substance.","63","2132285"
"9868","There are funny bits strewn throughout Game 6, and it's good to see Keaton in a meaty, nonshowy role for a change. He has the chops when he's not mugging.","63","425055"
"9869","At its worst, Vacancy is merely the kind of taut B-chiller they don't make any more, other than to riff on them in ""Grindhouse.""","63","452702"
"9870","Basically a PG-13 version of “After Hours,” with more than a bit of “The Out-of-Towners” thrown in.","63","1279935"
"9871","Kung Fu Panda goes nowhere surprising even as its images unscroll handsomely before our eyes. The sound could go out in the theater, and you wouldn't ask for your money back.","63","441773"
"9872","Crowe's chilliest movie. In part this is by design. Like ""Open Your Eyes,"" to which Crowe is mostly faithful, Vanilla Sky is a head trip that merges thriller, romance and science-fiction elements while playing with our notions of dreams and reality.","63","259711"
"9873","For director/co-writer John Carpenter, it's a chance for career renewal. For eyepatched lead and co-writer Kurt Russell, it'sa fitfully amusing lark, a harmlessly retro career move and a second audition for any future Rooster Cogburn parts. [09 Aug 1996, p.3D]","63","116225"
"9874","If The Informers doesn't sound to you like a pleasant time at the movies, you are right. To repeat: dread, despair and doom. It is often however repulsively fascinating and has been directed by Gregor Jordan as a soap opera from hell, with good sets and costumes.","63","865554"
"9875","Gosling's performance is a stunner, although the story-telling is otherwise pedestrian. It is the movie's blessing and curse that it does not shy away from Danny's murderous, inexplicable contradictions — or explain them.","63","247199"
"9876","To Kill a Mockingbird, set in Maycomb, Alabama, in 1932, uses the realities of its time only as a backdrop for the portrait of a brave white liberal.","63","56592"
"9877","Focus is a shiny, stylish shell game of a film that, much like its protagonists, relies on breezy chatter, a good sense of humor and a lot of misdirection to succeed.","63","2381941"
"9878","As he showed in ""The Imposter,"" writer-director Bart Layton knows how to spin a compelling yarn.","63","6212478"
"9879","I wish Eragon's cinematography were crisper, the music less Wagnerian, and the acting more consistent. But this movie isn't for me. It's for my 10-year-old, for whom the subtleties of narrative, photography and acting mean nothing.","63","449010"
"9880","As the two coaches head for a faceoff in a climactic live TV interview, writer Morgan starts to seem like a rip-off -- of himself.","63","1226271"
"9881","For a film about deep water terror, Jaws 2 is really quite shallow. [16 June 1978, p.3-2]","63","77766"
"9882","The direction is excellent. Frank Capra never lets his picture lag for a moment. It is never very exciting, but it moves along snappily and it is full of amusing situations.","63","25316"
"9883","Immensely moving and strikingly original, Kelly's story of a brilliant, disturbed teen (Jake Gyllenhaal) drowning in the cultural morass of the 1980s now feels bloated.","63","246578"
"9884","Watching Richard Gere’s charm and sweetness, as he turns into a metaphor for the nobodies of the world who hock their souls to be somebodies, is something very special indeed.","63","4191702"
"9885","It’s a good-if-not-great movie, old fashioned but anachronistic dialogue, action that’s more impressive than inspiring, a combat film that like Eastwood’s Western “Unforgiven,” tries to have it both ways — a sermon against the violence of man delivered in a very violent story.","63","2119532"
"9886","This PG-rated romp is, refreshingly, less notable for its happily-ever-afters than its oh-no-they-didn'ts.","63","2180411"
"9887","The script is clever and would be brilliant if it worked.","63","887883"
"9888","Yet for all that the director's unflinching vision, the cast's excellent performances and Mikhail Krichman's unerring cinematography impress themselves upon the viewer, there is something out of balance in Loveless.","63","6304162"
"9889","THE SHINING, billed as a ""masterpiece of modern horror,"" fails in one vital regard: it isn't very scary... Kubrick is master of visual images, and many of the scenes display his brilliance. But much of the suspense ends in anti-climax, and Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall seem over-extended in trying to maintain the terror. [28 June 1980]","63","81505"
"9890","The film begins as a cheeky retro chamber drama before morphing into an often expectation-busting blend of noir and pitch-black comedy.","63","6628394"
"9891","Robbins' performance as Winston is the best thing in the movie.","63","218817"
"9892","Individual scenes are set to the rhythm of the young women’s conversations, which at times approach Gilmore Girls-level warp speed.","63","3281548"
"9893","This cold, generally soulless movie does feel like it was made by people who are taking themselves way too seriously. Remember the delicious anticipation you felt when The Empire Strikes Back was over? You won't feel that way when The Matrix Reloaded reaches its cliffhanger finale. You'll just feel relief.","63","234215"

"9895","The story is about as good as the average TV cop drama. But here actions speak far louder than words, and Seagal is quite eloquent. Rather than weapons, he prefers a hands-on approach to his enemies. Twisted limbs are his specialty. [12 Feb 1990, p.2D]","63","99739"
"9896","The style is slick, the action is suspenseful, and despite the explicitness of the sex scenes, the message is against extramarital affairs.","63","93010"
"9897","A big, dark juggernaut of a movie about a big, dark juggernaut of a subject.","63","140352"
"9898","Given Helgeland's rep as a screenwriter (including an Oscar for 1997's L.A. Confidential), it rankles that 42 settles for the official story. The private Robinson, who died of a heart attack at 53 in 1972, stays private. We stay on the outside looking in. Let it be.","63","453562"
"9899","Despite melodrama that, at times, is enough to induce diabetes, there's enough wolf whistle in this sexy, scary romp to please anyone.","63","1259571"
"9900","It's not quite up to, or maybe down to, the level of the first two movies. But the movie rolls to a wildly funny climax at the Oscar presentations, where Drebin is mistaken for Phil Donahue. Surely, there are enough belly laughs and knee slaps to make this film worth your time. And stop calling me Shirley. [23 Mar 1994, p.6F]","63","110622"

"9904","The result, while not entirely devoid of entertainment value, doesn't work as a whole.","63","134273"
"9905","The film's chief misstep is taking its title too literally, and ultimately depicting Louie as an indestructible, and thus largely inhuman, superhero.","63","1809398"
"9906","All the parts of Return that deal with Luke's faith in his father and his appeals for him to reject the dark side of The Force are very emotional. In fact, the best sections of Return are extensions of the melancholy implications of ""The Empire Strikes Back."" [Special Edition]","63","86190"
"9907","Girls Trip accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do: shock and amuse. Along the way, it reminds us how important old friends can be.","63","3564472"
"9908","The movie is still incredibly silly but in a more boisterous way, like a comic book come to life.","63","1325004"
"9909","Much scampering, yelling, quaking and crying is required of the actors, and they acquit themselves well enough, even with oozing fake wounds and prop rebars piercing their shoulder blades.","63","1060277"
"9910","The characters' emotional vacancy feels like another auteurist tic to which Yorgos Lanthimos is dauntlessly committed.","63","5715874"
"9911","Instead of gleaning something from real life, the great minds behind Friends With Benefits slapped their ideas together based on screwball classics, ""Sleepless in Seattle"" bits, and a keen analysis of Hollywood hackery.","63","1632708"
"9912","There is an underlying likability to Austin Powers that sort of carries us through the movie.","63","145660"
"9913","The movie is a competent thriller, but maybe could have been more.","63","1458175"

"9916","The Road possesses undeniable sweep and a grim kind of grandeur, but it ultimately plays like a zombie movie with literary pretensions.","63","898367"
"9917","As an esthetic work, the movie is dismissable. As a social artifact, however, it's intriguing. Textually and sub-textually, intentionally or inadvertently, just what is being said here? [14 Aug 1992]","63","105414"
"9918","Temperamentally, Guy Ritchie aligns more with the lithe, James Bond-like Solo: detached, above-it-all, eternally cool under pressure.","63","1638355"

"9920","""Sixth Sense"" fans will be intrigued at first, then disappointed.","63","217869"
"9921","The final half-hour of Broken Embraces is littered with facile contrivances and plot turns worthy of a soap opera. It's almost mystifying, and more than a little frustrating, to watch a movie cruising at such a high level suddenly suffer a complete breakdown and lose too much altitude.","63","913425"
"9922","Me and Earl and the Dying Girl succumbs to the same cloying too-cuteness and solipsism that often plague its glib and sentimental genre. But those limitations are leavened by the film’s lively, ultimately affecting flourishes and sprightly voice.","63","2582496"
"9923","What we have here is a story out of early American history as retold by American pulp fiction, staged by a director with a sure touch for melodrama. [25 Sep 1992, p.G5]","63","104691"
"9924","The action sequences are energetic and suspenseful but they don't always mesh well with the dramatic material.","63","1586752"
"9925","The film contains far more passion and a tad more complexity than the dominant and typically more staid model of middlebrow costume drama.","63","1781769"
"9926","This is neither the noir world of old '40s movies, of which he's clearly fond, nor something new and original enough to fit the concept. Instead, it feels like a blueprint for someone else to figure out.","63","393109"

"9932","Mulroney is a drip with not a milliliter of chemistry with either woman. Roberts doesn't really seem to care about him so much as the fact that life is passing her by. Though, that may be the point.","63","119738"
"9933","Even with its flaws and struggles with originality, Aquaman is reminiscent of the early Marvel movies in its storytelling, best when taking wild swings instead of being an earnest superhero jam.","63","1477834"
"9934","A super-stoked action thriller","63","1320253"
"9935","Maudie works valiantly, and not entirely convincingly, to suggest a happy-ish marriage, all things considered.","63","3721954"
"9936","Although Sheridan has approached the setting with the sensitivity and respect of his deeply empathic protagonist, the film still bears a slight but inescapable whiff of cultural tourism.","63","5362988"
"9937","Eventually, though, the monsters come out -- blind, snarling cave-dwellers, looking much like Gollum's bigger kin -- and The Descent becomes a simple exercise in guessing who, if anyone, will survive.","63","435625"
"9938","Though it’s been many years in development, it remains a timely look at the dangers of our increasingly outsourced, privatized military-intelligence network.","63","1488606"

"9941","Robin Hood’s shameless silliness only takes it so far, as the film is frequently undermined by Otto Bathurst’s wobbly direction.","63","4532826"
"9942","Character is almost wholly subordinated to a blast-furnace rendering of the hell into which they're dumped. Seldom will you see so many US military body parts strewn around a movie screen.","63","265086"
"9943","This is a film which takes classic source material and imbues it on screen with a sense of wonder commensurate to its prior form, perhaps offering an even more visceral impression of the possibilities inherent to this beautiful, tragic world.","63","1343092"
"9944","As it turns out, “Don’t try to understand it, feel it” is mixed advice. Viewers won’t be able to fully understand Tenet’s dialogue, and they’re likely to have the same problem in trying to understand its convoluted plot. But there isn’t much there to feel, either, making the experience feel more like a math exam than a mesmerizing action film.","63","6723592"
"9945","The script by Ben Ripley doesn't come up with enough obstacles to throw in the hero's path, and his budding romance with the doomed Christina feels more like a studio mandate than an organic development.","63","945513"
"9946","I love Pete Postlethwaite as a rule, but here - as a murderous florist who pulls all the strings - he overacts his key scene so badly it's as if he did it on a dare. Also, Jon Hamm may rule on ""Mad Men,"" but here he's stuck as a rather dimwitted FBI agent who's two beats behind the action, always.","63","840361"

"9950","Luca Guadagnino’s Suspiria is an interesting intellectual exercise, too ambitious to be ignored yet too overbearing to be enjoyed. Despite moments of genuine terror the film is less interesting in being scary than it is in humanizing what scares us, but once we know more about the witches in Suspiria, the less intriguing they are.","64","1034415"
"9951","Ocean’s 8 feels a bit like a high-end knockoff in that way that lots of spinoff films can, although the compensation is the familiar delights of watching smart characters do their job very, very well.","64","5164214"
"9952","It’s tempting to believe a great sci-fi yarn exists in Carter, somewhere in the no doubt thick sheaf of studio notes demanding more spoon-feeding of an audience they believe to be equally thick. But more likely, it’s possible that Stanton simply wasn’t ready to make the leap from animation to super-budgeted live action.","65","401729"
"9953","So why can't I love Moonrise Kingdom? For all the movie's technical meticulousness, the storytelling still has a wiggly-waggly quality, like a dangly loose tooth.","65","1748122"
"9954","I walked out wondering how a mini-series might have better served this historic moment and the men who made it. Still, with all its gaps and flaws, Midway is a serviceable ode to servicemen this Veteran's Day weekend.","65","6924650"
"9955","If only there was as much thought put into the characters as there was the visuals. For all of his convoluted backstory, Kubo is a remarkably unconflicted character, and barely faces a moment of internal turmoil throughout the entire film.","65","4302938"
"9956","If the story behind this chilling internet creation could have matched the quality of those aforementioned strong points, Sony would have a real horror gem on their hands.","65","5690360"
"9957","For all its dazzling allure, Darren Aronofsky's Black Swan, a feverishly psycho thriller set in the hermetic world of classical ballet, proves a meaningless exercise in Grand Guignol exhibitionism.","65","947798"
"9958","An awkward jumble of half-assed thriller and lumbering romantic comedy, less competent by a wide margin than ""The Lives of Others."" It's also a whole lot sillier, though not in a good way.","65","1243957"
"9959","Screenwriter Steven Rogers and director David Gillespie get an “A” for effort as far as their brave attempt to meld these wildly differing tones into a cohesive narrative, but their execution, as satisfying as it might be, too obviously reaches for a pedigree it hasn’t yet earned.","65","5580036"

"9962","The actor proves capable of embodying all sorts of contradictory impulses as his character becomes tragically self-aware. But he can't overcome a plot that goes slack at precisely the moment it should be soaring, or a corporate-villainy premise that practically begs not to be looked at too closely.","65","1182345"
"9963","Perry weaves together not just the individual stories but their arcs, sustaining the emotional tenor across the progress of nine lives.","65","1405500"
"9964","The Predator is, in many ways, a throwback to what made the 1987 original so beloved: it includes many of the same elements, such as the rowdy camaraderie amongst absurdly macho protagonists, a debauched wit, and a primal battle between man and beast. It’s a shame when everything splinters apart in the haphazard and shoddy-looking last half-hour.","65","3829266"
"9965","Landon, who wrote four of the “Paranormal Activity” films, knows a lot about reverse engineering scary scenarios from mundane situations, but as with later installments of that series, he overcomplicates the logistics and mythology of the premise, aiming for something more raucous (and fun) in tone but lacking the intensity — or inevitability — to make its repetition feel truly chilling.","65","5308322"
"9966","Turteltaub strives to show us realistic-looking magic, without realizing he'd be better off if he acknowledged that there's no such thing. Instead, we get human figures that emerge ""magically"" from swarms of cockroaches and sorceresses who dissolve into dust particles right before our eyes. It's the best CGI money can buy, and who cares?","65","963966"
"9967","It’s Del Toro who really gets to strut his stuff with a subtle, ambiguous, and riveting performance. In a field of top-notch actors, he’s the one whom you remember days later.","65","181865"

"9969","Despite the movie showcasing her brilliance and tenacity, at times it's sanitized and schmaltzy, which takes away from the overall impact of the story.","65","4669788"
"9970","Butter thrives on skewering characters whose self-importance isolates them completely from the consequences of their actions. And while the film's perspective is distinctly liberal, providing several thinly veiled criticisms of conservative politicians, nearly everyone (except Destiny) is guilty of something.","65","1349451"
"9971","Lucy in the Sky is an odd curio, a drama that’s forlornly funny, a comedy of social manners with a howling desperation fueling its engine. I admire the balance that Hawley tries to strike, between the mundane and the sublime.","65","4682804"
"9972","Hill’s made an unabashed love letter to a particular decade, sure, but also to a specific moment in everyone’s life. And while he undercuts his own movie by romanticizing even the most extreme experiences of lost innocence, the purity of Stevie’s longing makes the movie’s wistful fantasy understandable.","65","5613484"
"9973","Last Flag Flying isn’t great—a concept like greatness is too highfalutin for a film so bone-dry modest—but its scruffy integrity digs at you, won’t let you quite dismiss it.","65","6018306"
"9974","Rather than dig into the mind-boggling, byzantine inner workings of the OASIS, Spielberg spends time with the flashier stuff. He is, even in this later, moodier phase of his career, still an entertainer first and foremost.","65","1677720"
"9975","We Need to Talk About Kevin is a little too facile in the way it sets up the horrific climax: Just one look at this kid and you know he's trouble, yet no one besides mom can see it.","65","1242460"
"9976","A Quiet Place is a taut piece of genre filmmaking, to be sure, though it succeeds because it leads with a believable, if heightened, portrayal of a loving family.","65","6644200"

"9979","A reliably solid treat.","65","191754"
"9980","The film has much more talking than acting, so McDonagh is wise to give it all the zest he can muster... But McDonagh, for all his agility as a writer, stumbles in fleshing out the story.","65","2234003"
"9981","Another adventure in nostalgia that nobody really needed and yet, if not excellent, manages to be good-hearted and reasonably fun.","65","1086064"
"9982","As The Fifth Estate excitedly illustrates, in the Internet age no one can ever really have the last word.","65","1837703"

"9984","The Comedy of Emasculation that Judd Apatow and his disciples have made into a separate economy was invented by the Farrelly brothers.","65","480687"
"9985","Nothing Cruise does seems to come from the inside -- every eye crinkle, every grimace, every brow furrow seems plucked from the air, collected from the universe around him and bent to do his bidding. Maybe that’s one kind of acting. But it’s not cool. Never will be.","65","1013743"
"9986","When it comes to the emotional state of those being laid off, of their families and even of those doing the laying off, it gets things right enough to make audiences squirm.","65","1172991"
"9987","Bridesmaids is the Bride of Frankenstein of contemporary comedies, a movie stitched together crudely, and only semi-successfully, from random chick flick and bromance parts.","65","1478338"
"9988","Knightley has the least screen time of the three, and her Ruth never registers as much more than a self-serving menace.","65","1334260"
"9989","Fairly enjoyable as an old-fashioned horror yarn -- or, if that doesn't work for you, as a black comedy about an obsessive collector.","65","142688"
"9990","Lawrence (that’s Lawrence the director, not star Jennifer Lawrence) skirts the edges of the world of cruel, leering exploitation, but doesn’t go all the way. The film stays sober and clear-eyed, showing us all this unflinching violence not to titillate, I don’t think, but to alarm.","65","2873282"
"9991","Assiduous, temperate, and a lot more honest about government and politicians than any other Hollywood film of the last few decades, Thirteen Days is nevertheless too little, too late.","65","146309"
"9992","Apatow's film comes across as overstuffed and understructured, a collection of elements that hasn't really been assembled into a story and could do with the backbone.","65","1758830"
"9993","Blockers ends up being a mirror-image coming-of-age film, where the kids have to help the adults make some grand realizations.","65","2531344"
"9994","The fifth entry, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, is the most divertingly enjoyable since the first. A professionally crafted brew of action, slapstick and supernatural mumbo-jumbo, it’s less likely to spur timepiece glances than did the last few bloated installments.","65","1790809"
"9995","Mostly, The Mechanic creaks and groans as it goes through the motions, and not even its lavish violence - which includes much smashing of heads and a nasty screwdriver stabbing - is particularly electrifying.","65","472399"
"9996","It’s sweet, just like the original movie. It was faint praise then, and it still is.","65","3760922"

"9998","This jailhouse jam is quite a haul.","65","120689"
"9999","It’s a deliriously silly, often preposterous movie...but director Susanna Fogel keeps things moving too quickly to leave much time for complaints.","65","6663582"
"10000","The filmmaking has a certain paint-by-numbers frankness that works in some ways, not in others.","65","4196450"
"10001","The melodies are pleasant, the sentiments worthy, the verbiage dexterous. But it all blurs together into one ill-defined mass, nothing distinct enough (besides, I suppose, that opening number) to stick out.","65","5028340"
"10002","It’s the unexpected amount of heart that ends up making Bad Boys for Life a pleasant surprise.","65","1502397"
"10003","Soderbergh, like Tarantino, has a knack for making every shady character onscreen fascinating.","65","165854"
"10004","For every line or gag that works, there are three or four more that seem to belong in a different movie altogether, either a darker one or a breezier one.","65","1622547"
"10005","Big hair, fine period frocks and interior design lend The Help a pleasingly retro look. Yet for someone who grew up in Mississippi, the director has little sense of place.","65","1454029"
"10006","The Old Man & the Gun is never less than pleasant, and Redford's fans might even find it resonant. Others may think it's cute but underwhelming, sweet-natured but forgettable. There are worse ways to spend your time.","65","2837574"
"10007","The best scenes in Solitary Man find Douglas at his most charming, dispensing nuggets of wisdom to whomever will listen. His may not be an altogether honorable life, but it's a life in full.","65","1294213"
"10008","Rao's ultimate achievements - including a balanced, doleful tone and moments of city symphony elegance - are undercut by the arrangement of her characters into narrative castes that cross paths but can't quite connect.","65","1433810"
"10009","Presented with a moral universe where annihilation is all, it’s difficult to invest in the film as anything more significant than a breathless series of punishing vignettes.","65","3072482"
"10010","Mudbound’s is a large and cumbersome story not because of the complicated dynamics it presents, but because of the way they’re presented, with a lot of opportunity to explore the complexity between characters, but little of those opportunities are constructively used, perhaps because there is too much material on hand.","65","2396589"
"10011","Over-plotty, convoluted, full of unanswered questions and unquestioned assumptions — is a big part of the problem here, but director Neil Burger (“Limitless”) pulls off a neat trick here, in that Divergent is a pretty diverting piece of moviemaking pulled from a not-especially-good story.","65","1840309"
"10012","Harper’s is that rare movie that works much better when the characters are finding solutions and working together rather than falling into conflict and creating problems.","65","6141246"
"10013","Boiled down to its core, the 1978 Halloween was about the chilling permeability of the suburbs and the ease with which American domesticity could be disrupted. Green’s new movie sticks to that theme, and does it well, but the film only shows hints of being something more interesting until its excellent final act.","65","1502407"
"10014","Oblivion occupies an awkward no-man's-land between escapist space adventure and heady science fiction, but it's neither thrilling enough nor intellectually stimulating enough to satisfy devotees of either.","65","1483013"
"10015","Thankfully, Vol. 2 does come together in the end with a powerful emotional payoff, but that’s only after it becomes a computer-generated action-fest with the fate of the universe hanging in the balance again.","65","3896198"
"10016","With The Way Back, O’Connor works so hard to avoid sports movie cliché that he pares the film down to something unsustainably lean. Without Affleck’s gravity, The Way Back would just drift away.","65","8544498"
"10017","It’s always apparent what Assassination Nation is going for, and it more often than not fulfills its ambitions, and the hits more than make up for the misses.","65","6205872"
"10018","What hasn't advanced is the plotting, which was nothing special last time and is so formulaic now that it's basically surprise-free.","65","1453405"
"10019","Ocean’s 8 is fun. The sequel (of sorts) to Steven Soderbergh’s three Ocean’s films, this time with a mostly female cast of smooth criminals, is a lark and a laugh, an airy caper featuring a bunch of actors you love and a lot of great clothes. Who can argue with that, in June or any other time of year? In that way, Ocean’s 8 is a worthy continuation of a hallowed brand. So, breathe a sigh of relief. There’s no disaster here, no regrettable misfire to be chagrined about. Phew. That said, I do wish Ocean’s 8 were a little more than fun.","65","5164214"
"10020","Dirty Girl is harmless enough, and the early scenes, in which Danielle surveys poor Clarke with snobbish contempt, have a pleasing nastiness.","65","1107319"
"10021","Turns out to be a disappointingly standard addiction story in its second half also serves as a reminder that Hollywood tends to be more invested in these types of self-serious movies than most actual audiences.","65","1907668"
"10022","It's silly and often laughable, but it's a sweet fantasy, too, produced in loving homage to the frothiest traditions of stage and screen.","65","1126591"
"10023","Even middling Welles is better than none, and it's a treat to see his longtime collaborators like Paul Stewart and Mercedes McCambridge performing as brilliantly as ever. John Huston is a special delight.","65","69049"
"10024","All of these actors deliver the kind of subtle work that’s rarely seen in major Hollywood movies. Still, while Sachs is one of the most exciting voices in American indie cinema, his European sojourn is sometimes a little too sleepy for its own good—beautiful in the moment, but too gentle to leave a lasting impression.","65","8019694"
"10025","Downhill is a clever movie when it could have been profound, had, perhaps, Faxon and Rash been willing—or capable—of digging deeper.","65","4558376"
"10026","Most of Stephen Frears' Tamara Drewe is so breezily entertaining, and so bracingly clear-eyed about what total pains in the asses writers can be, that its final 15 minutes feel like an all-wrong slap in the face.","65","1486190"
"10027","The bad news is that The Conspirator - doesn't have enough crackle.","65","968264"
"10028","Oldman treats Churchill’s words the way a Broadway virtuoso would: as the showstopper. And who can blame him? It works.","65","4555426"
"10029","Since it took 28 years to get it to the big screen, the fact that the end result feels rushed and hasty probably qualifies as irony.","65","1731141"
"10030","Because the film is overproduced and unconvincing in telegraphing its several gestural themes, its excellent lead performances get lost in what feels like an aesthetic tug of war over what a movie should be, and do.","65","1423995"
"10031","Tries too hard and ultimately achieves less. It's undone by its own inferiority complex.","65","1001526"
"10032","The timing couldn't be more opportunistic for a new Steven Spielberg movie that mines the thrilling uncertainties of childhood - even if it happens to have been made by J.J. Abrams.","65","1650062"
"10033","Hustlers is an uneven but mostly entertaining tale of strippers exploiting their exploiters.","65","5503686"
"10034","It's when Coppola lets the beautiful, gorgeous things retain their sparkle that The Bling Ring shines most brightly.","65","2132285"
"10035","While Hacksaw Ridge is undeniably made with great care and skill, for all of its good intentions it can never refute that famous Truffaut observation that making an anti-war film is essentially impossible, since to portray something is to ennoble it. In celebrating this legendary pacifist, Gibson and company ennoble the hell out of violence.","65","2119532"
"10036","I have to applaud Goddard’s ambition, even when it overreaches. Yes, Bad Times at the El Royale is bloated and might’ve functioned better as a punchy bit of neo-noir. But it’s rare for a genre film to feel so sweeping and inventive.","65","6628394"
"10037","It’s a paean to the loving of a thing, rather than a movie that gives that thing an entirely new existence, free-standing and self-possessed in its own right, despite Gerwig’s narrative tinkering.","65","3281548"
"10038","A profile in real-life courage that would be stronger as a movie if it weren't quite so intent on underlining teachable moments.","65","453562"
"10039","Inner life comes hard to Knightley, and she never gets a grip on the mounting emotional turmoil that threatens to crush Anna as she progresses from stylish young hipster-about-town to kept woman to bereft mother to paranoid social pariah.","65","1781769"
"10040","The story of a woman dismissed by those around her who asserts herself through art testifies to the indomitable power of creativity. Why turn that compelling story into a predictable romance?","65","3721954"
"10041","It’s exhilarating, in a “Fast & Furious” sort of way, especially as so many of the stunts are done for real rather than with CGI. It helps, too, that the swaggering Washington and the smirking Pattinson make a likable double act. But it all happens so quickly, with such brief explanations and so little breathing space, that the story is tough to follow, and therefore tough to care about.","65","6723592"
"10042","The period setting is sumptuous, and Edward Norton brings true humanity to the role of Lionel Essrog.","66","385887"
"10043","Despite terrific comic acting...and an atomic first hour, Fight Club makes a few wrong turns and ends up lost itself.","66","137523"
"10044","Visually, Pitch Black is sleek and stylish in a post-apocalyptic way, and a scantily clad Radha Mitchell does a nice, more femme variation of Sigourney Weaver's Ripley.","66","134847"
"10045","As moving as the families’ recoveries can be, and as earnest as Greengrass is at trying to honor their stories, there is an undeniable waft of the familiar in his dramatization of their difficulties. Greengrass hasn’t found a new spin on this sort of material. You admire the resilience, but I’m not sure Greengrass makes you feel it.","66","7280898"
"10046","While the urban texture and the unapologetic work of Basinger impart a sophisticated air to what is essentially a downtrodden-teen-makes-good film, that is, finally, just what 8 Mile is. That's not a bad thing, but it's nothing to rap home about, either.","67","298203"
"10047","For a film that invites so much self-aware chortling over franchise in-jokery, you feel Spider-Verse has missed something essential from its own screen history.","67","4633694"
"10048","It's never altogether clear why this visually blah and dramatically bland movie needed to be made at all (or why it wasn't made for television instead). The only answer I can come up with is that Murray wanted to show off with a cigarette-holder.","67","1477855"
"10049","Farrelly is telling a heart-warming, comical buddy story first and foremost, and Green Book, for better or worse, feels more like a wholehearted familial embrace than a treatise on the state of race in America today.","67","6966692"
"10050","For some viewers, Moonrise Kingdom may be movie heaven, another bric-a-brac-jammed bauble to place alongside ""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou"" and ""The Darjeeling Limited."" Personally, though, I wish that Anderson would come out from under the glass, or at least change what he's doing under there.","67","1748122"
"10051","As an experiment in filmmaking trickery, All the Money in the World is an extraordinary viewing experience; without that, it’s a compulsively watchable rumination on the worst of the one percent.","67","5294550"
"10052","It's all a bit much, yes, a bit exhausting, that's true, but then why on earth would anyone expect otherwise?","67","383574"
"10053","What's in a name? Lately, less and less. With Daniel Craig's third go at 007, I'm not sure there's much left that distinguishes Bond from Bourne from Batman. They're all slurping from the same soup – think: death-haunted, self-righteous, tight-lipped and -quipped, parkour enthusiast.","67","1074638"
"10054","It’s a vivid indictment of the way in which we all stumble along, yet the film never musters full-throated chagrin at our dull complacency.","67","1225822"
"10055","As an updated version of the old western TV show, it does a pleasant enough job.","67","110478"
"10056","Hanks is remarkable in one of the minor films in smarm-meister Spielberg's oeuvre.","67","362227"
"10057","Leterrier's film is a reminder that sometimes a good yarn can do enough heavy lifting on its own to provide thrills. Whether or not the illusion pays off will be up to you, but the trick itself may be intriguing enough.","67","1670345"
"10058","Weaver essays the new hotmama Ripley with wry, good humor -- you can tell she's having a ball playing this unstoppable die-cast she-wolf.","67","118583"
"10059","Summer was made for this kind of film, and Predators is almost exactly what you need to fix this otherwise busted summer cinema season.","67","1424381"
"10060","With Tom Hanks appropriately cast as good-natured Sully, Eastwood delivers an earnest, straightforward look at the way the captain’s professionalism saved the day. But while that aspect of the movie hits more than a few obvious notes, the crash is the real star of the show.","67","3263904"
"10061","As Zeus, Liam Neeson twinkles where Laurence Olivier kvetched, and Ralph Fiennes, as Zeus' dark brother Hades (who has egged on the revolt to challenge Zeus), has a slinky nastiness.","67","800320"
"10062","Lane skillfully sells the tech-heavy script. But after a much-too-early reveal of the murderer's identity, the ''low battery'' signal starts to flash on this film by thriller specialist Gregory Hoblit, director of last year's far superior ""Fracture.""","67","880578"
"10063","The character never really comes alive, and I walked away from Into the Wild feeling that Penn was too in love with the idea of Christopher McCandless the free-spirited hero to excavate the soul of Christopher McCandless the lost man.","67","758758"
"10064","The funniest moments in Groundhog Day come when Phil takes sneaky advantage of his predicament-by, say, pumping a sexy woman in the local coffee shop for facts about her past and then, ''the next day,'' using the information to lure her into bed. What the movie lacks is the ingenious, lapidary comic structure that could have made these moments fuse into something tricky and wild.","67","107048"
"10065","It's one of the better sequels to come out in years, and although it doesn't pack the emotional wallop of the first film, it's still head and shoulders (and punctured eyeballs) above most of what's out there.","67","120082"
"10066","Midway does a decent job of cramming in not only the eponymous three-day naval battle between the United States Navy and the Imperial Japanese Navy but also treats the audience to a wealth of other, related Greatest Generation’s greatest hits.","67","6924650"
"10067","Doesn't take advantage of its own possibilities, either as a hard-boiled gangland battle or as a soft-boiled, interracial Shakespearean love story.","67","165929"
"10068","It’s always a pleasure to be in the company of Potter, and when looking back at the just-competent first outings – well, baby, you’ve come a long way – but still: Where’s the magic, huh?","67","417741"
"10069","In any case, none of the gambles Jim makes over the course of the movie are as ballsy as the film’s casting strategy. Will audiences really buy Mark Wahlberg as a wordsmith too brilliant for academia? Smart money says no.","67","2039393"
"10070","It's all more lightweight-likable than exciting.","67","1446192"
"10071","With The Brave One, Jodie Foster and director Neil Jordan shift the genre to the murky left, where right and wrong are not so black and white. In doing so, they have taken away the very thing that makes a vigilante movie work.","67","476964"
"10072","Only Amy Adams, playing Mickey's tough-tender girlfriend Char­lene, manages to be convincingly working-class without seeming either dopey or rabid or strung-out.","67","964517"
"10073","Working with an explanatory script by Dean Georgaris, Reynolds is much more confident in scenes of realistic battle, or even muddy marketplace dailiness, than he is with scenes of desire.","67","375154"
"10074","Too in love with itself to ever totally go off the rails, Pacific Rim doesn't qualify as the first full-on dud of del Toro's career, but it's hard not to get the sense that something's missing.","67","1663662"
"10075","For a movie about happiness, Thirteen Conversations is terribly joyless. Thirteen Conversations tries hard and its ambitions are provocative, but its conversations often fall like that Zen tree in the forest.","67","268690"
"10076","The best parts of The Shape of Water, a fantasy fairy tale set in 1962 in a top-secret aerospace research center, are marvelously rhapsodic in ways that recall films like Jean Cocteau’s “Beauty and the Beast” without ever seeming slavish.","67","5580390"
"10077","Although the filmmakers try to avoid roteness, the conflicts tend to play out along circumscribed lines. This gives the film a seesaw sameness. It's all a bit too diagrammed.","67","935075"
"10078","The humor ranges from situational gags to wordplay both clever and juvenile. Despite routine lapses into gay panic and the kind of dick-stroking shadowplay that was exhausted a decade ago by the Austin Powers franchise, there are strong laughs sprinkled throughout, culminating in an unexpectedly inspired climactic car chase.","67","2170439"
"10079","For sheer craftsmanship, As Above, So Below is the type of horror film you should see theatrically. It's really well-made, even if it ends up feeling a little familiar by the end.","67","2870612"
"10080","A sunny ode to capitalism, the movie is a coy advertisement of its own. In that context, it's a whole lot better than one might expect, and loaded with talent unabashedly hawking their wares.","67","2446980"
"10081","Let Me In is a beautiful redundancy.","67","1228987"
"10082","The effect is to turn a brain-optional shoot-'em-up into a military recruiting commercial, which may not be an accident.","67","1217613"
"10083","Nothing near a modern vampire classic. Still, ""Queen"" is a great dose of vamp camp","67","238546"
"10084","The performances are solid and subtle, with Depardieu growing nicely into the brooding, smarter-than-he-looks roles his father tackled for years.","67","781435"
"10085","Is any of this, you know, fun? Just barely. But I'm sure I would have loved it at 6.","67","120738"
"10086","The story is too patterned and too contrived.","67","498399"
"10087","Salt is hooey, but in a medium in which hooey is the stock-in-trade, it's effective hooey, and hooey with admirable craft, and, most of all, breezy hooey.","67","944835"
"10088","Not to get all Dorothy about it, but when it comes to Cars, there's no place like home. The emotional punch of the original is inextricably rooted in the movie's appreciation of off-the-beaten-track America, and all that homegrown vintage car culture signifies.","67","1216475"
"10089","Low-voltage and forgettable.","67","140397"
"10090","As great as the film looks, the story, adapted from a novel by P.D. James, never quite comes into focus.","67","206634"
"10091","You may enjoy this complex, psychologically daring and visually stylish noir, which has been put together by director Bruce Evans (""Kuffs"") with few dull moments and virtually none of the black humor you might expect from the premise.","67","780571"
"10092","Banderas uses all his old wiles in this well-oiled, businesslike, quite clangingly violent sequel to ""The Mask of Zorro.""","67","386140"
"10093","Doesn't break any new ground in the baseball movie playbook. However, it does bring it all back home with the assurance of seasoned pro.","67","265662"
"10094","A host of A-list stars have been enlisted to play small roles in a bid for viewer engagement. See Mariah Carey in a blink-or-you’ll-miss-her role as Cecil Gaines’ maltreated mother.","67","1327773"
"10095","Its aesthetics alone are enough to sustain interest over its two-and-a-half hour runtime, but its hefty length also leaves a lot to be desired in its messaging, if only because Mitchell actually does begin to flirt with a grander purpose at a certain point in the film.","67","5691670"
"10096","Not quite funny enough, or serious enough, falls into the muddle middle.","67","1201167"
"10097","Even if you know what’s coming, it’s a neat bit of meta-thriller filmmaking, as much about the mechanics of storytelling as a reasonably satisfying example of it.","67","971209"
"10098","In the end, Walter Mitty is a film about acting out our dreams. But Stiller never quite shows us the soul of his dreamer.","67","359950"
"10099","It's a reserved, almost conservative performance, and in holding so much back so much of the time, Cumberbatch makes his few outward displays of emotion far more impactful.","67","2084970"
"10100","Returning director Ron Howard somewhat belabors the Botticelli-inspired hallucinations Langdon suffers from following a konk on the head – though you really can’t oversell the creepiness of a beaky plague mask – but he continues to have an inspired hand in casting his supporting players.","67","3062096"
"10101","Directed by Luis Llosa with all of the subtlety of a snake-oil salesman, is in the great tradition of cinematic cheese, as processed as Kraft Singles slices. [18 Apr 1997, p. 48]","67","118615"
"10102","Because of its subject matter, and because of the actors, it's impossible to watch this film without being moved. But a martinet is running the show.","67","1602620"
"10103","As a romantic comedy, the picture is pleasant, predictable, and utterly weightless.","67","120888"
"10104","The picture is nearly painstaking in its traditionalism, a tale of love, war, and valor in which nostalgia for ''simpler times'' gets mashed together, almost fetishistically, with nostalgia for old movies and for the spirit of knightly self sacrifice during World War II.","67","213149"
"10105","[Keaton's] lost none of the spunk, sass, and ditzbomb charm of her ""Annie Hall"" days. She, quite simply, is marvelous. Too bad her similarly iconic co-star is such a toad. Jack never stops being Jack, to great distraction.","67","337741"
"10106","The writing is zippy, the story spins like a top, and Bardem turns out to be the wittiest of leading men.","67","497465"
"10107","Brandon Lee's swan song is a kinetic, pounding, adrenalized feast for the senses, if not the psyche. Bursting with startling images, eclectic staging, and gorgeous neo-gothic set design.","67","109506"
"10108","Identifying the method behind the Coens’ madness takes some work, as the film moves at such a rat-a-tat-tat screwball speed that following along often feels like clinging for dear life to the side of a speeding train.","67","475290"
"10109","The Tourist is less likely to be remembered for its cat-and-mouse machinations than for the beautiful people carrying them out.","67","1243957"
"10110","Braveheart features some of the most enthralling combat sequences in years, and the excessive ferocity of the violence is part of the thrill.","67","112573"
"10111","It's a sympathomimetic monoamine that stimulates the central nervous system! Hooray epinephrine! And that's all I'm going to say about Crank.","67","479884"
"10112","Janney knows how to nail a line like few others in the business. It helps that, in this film, she has most of the best ones.","67","5580036"
"10113","Viewers hoping for a foray into ""Donnie Darko"" territory will be disappointed by this shift in tone. But those who like things sentimental and sweet – and there’s nothing wrong with that – will find comfort in the notion of leaving the past behind to allow the future to go forward.","67","5805752"
"10114","A wholly fictional tale, and while it has a few lovely, tender moments, there’s a definite feeling of “been there, drawn that.”","67","1990217"
"10115","Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy is boldly dull in protest to modern movie tastes, and that alone may earn it more praise than it deserves.","67","1340800"
"10116","A classic Sundance résumé movie -- texturally interesting, bubbling with ideas, and as structurally predictable as a cardboard box.","67","181984"
"10117","A big, loud, sometimes clever, often dumb behemoth of a movie.","67","160127"
"10118","It's a dirty, ugly, joyless world these fathers and sons live in, and for all the passion involved, of retribution and a father's fierce love, Perdition is as emotionally distant as Sullivan. The feelings are all there, just submerged.","67","257044"
"10119","The double role suits Rockwell perfectly -- in fact, it suits him a little too well.","67","1182345"
"10120","Little more than a lavish, art-directed slasher movie.","67","162661"
"10121","It’s [Depp's] first genuine “adult” role (not counting the tedious Nick of Time), and it allows him the freedom and emotional range to move, speak, and deal with issues more as an actor and less as a brat-packer.","67","119008"
"10122","Trainwreck can be furiously funny. It just goes down too easy. It’s scared of its own sharp edges. The sly raging against the machine of Inside Amy Schumer has gone missing. Here, the rage, curiously, is turned inward.","67","3152624"
"10123","Apted (""Gorillas in the Mist,"" ""Coal Miner's Daughter"") keeps things low-key and low-tech, which makes some of the cliched Bondisms a bit easier to swallow.","67","143145"
"10124","Without the steadfast intelligence of Clooney's performance, Michael Clayton wouldn't work half as well as it does.","67","465538"
"10125","Never shocks or even offends by ascribing fully adult cruelties and erotic activities to obnoxious kids; such harshness wouldn't flatter a cast this moussed and magazine-layout-ready.","67","139134"
"10126","One of the better aspects of Search is that with Spock out of the action, the rest of the crew gets a chance to fill up the vacuum of his absence, and we get a much stronger sense of Kirk, Uhura, Chekov, McCoy, Scotty, and Sulu as a family unit, and not just a bunch of people who work together.","67","88170"
"10127","Danny Boyle's glittering, deadpan, nihilistic little thriller.","67","111149"
"10128","At 2 1/2 hours, the film is too long in the telling and too short on suspense.","67","443706"
"10129","It's no myth: All play and no work makes Jackman, as Leopold, a doll of a boyfriend.","67","35423"
"10130","Compared with a superior potboiler like ""Salt,"" which messed with your brain in entertainingly far-fetched ways, Safe House is action-movie porridge gussied up into a less-clever-than-it-seems mystery.","67","1599348"
"10131","For all its surface dazzle, The Prestige shares with this year's earlier ""The Illusionist"" a certain core hollowness. Maybe that's a natural consequence of even the best magic shows: You can't help but feel duped.","67","482571"
"10132","It's good -- no, great -- to see Williams as a mean rat bastard.","67","266452"
"10133","It's not a question of Lucas' right to revamp his own work -- the movie simply was much better without these absurd additions.","67","66434"
"10134","It's not perfect King, but it is jarringly close, which these days remains pretty much all one could hope for.","67","118636"
"10135","The movie pretends to warn against such shallowness -- but flaunts its arousal at how exciting such a controllable world is for those with access to the software.","67","258153"
"10136","It's a little disappointing to see Van Sant dial back into mainstream respectability. Had he evoked Harvey Milk's life with the poetry that he did Kurt Cobain's, Milk might have been something special.","67","1013753"
"10137","Too much of Sunshine is like a cross between a middling ""Alien"" movie and ""Solaris"" (the woozy Steven Soderbergh version).","67","448134"
"10138","Nightmare’s macabre humor is very adult, yet the storytelling is woefully simplistic.","67","107688"
"10139","An engagingly whimsical, sporadically charming, frequently very funny Southern Gothic fantasy that somehow doesn't quite come together to be as magical or meaningful as it's intended to be.","67","319061"
"10140","As a piece of escapism, this deluxe, action-heavy, 2-hour-and-21-minute Robin Hood gets the job done. You’re carried along by plot, production values, and some choice supporting actors. Yet it’s a rouser without a rousing hero. Costner doesn’t disgrace himself — he has the star presence the role demands. What he’s not is an impassioned Robin Hood. And without the sense that Robin is on a humanistic mission (one that’s a pleasure to fulfill), the story has no charge.","67","102798"
"10141","As long as Sing Street stays on this sweet, sentimental path, the film is an agreeable toe-tapper. Scratch the surface too deeply and you’ll find some historical inconsistencies, idealized events, and a depressing environment roiling in Conor’s familial home and nation.","67","3544112"
"10142","The Cable Guy works best as a movie about how damn hard it is tell someone that you’re really not interested in getting to know them better.","67","115798"
"10143","It's Winslet who is the heart and soul of Little Children, and when she makes a desperate, final bid to reclaim her soul, it's both horrifying and heart-rending.","67","404203"
"10144","A charming, touching, and deeply compassionate depiction of modern middle-class motherhood.","67","5610554"
"10145","A great, bizarre, and ultimately very, very unique film.","67","270288"
"10146","It's a kinder, gentler ""Tales From the Crypt"" that, in the end, is neither kind nor gentle.","67","161081"
"10147","For Colored Girls is blessed with a Murderer's Row of black female actors, each tearing ferociously into Shange's words and gamely hanging on through Perry's.","67","1405500"
"10148","End of Watch is more than the sum of its parts, though; it ends on a downbeat note, but that's something I've come to expect from Ayer.","67","1855199"
"10149","Charming, funny, and sentimental, the film is exactly what you expect it to be, but very satisfying in achieving that goal.","67","1441951"
"10150","A heavy dose of corn syrup. Director Darren Aronofsky's herky-jerky, hand-held camera stylistics have a veneer of verity, but don't be fooled. This pastiche, written by Robert Siegel, is purest Hollywood.","67","1125849"
"10151","All herky-jerky camera movements and no pussyfooting around with the interior lives of these characters.","67","372183"
"10152","Manages to incorporate all these things into a moving yet unsentimental story about the beauty of maintaining one's wits while stumbling blindly in the insane no man's land that lies beyond wit's end.","67","118799"
"10153","There’s much to like, from Waltz’s performance to the typically rich production and costume design.","67","2333804"
"10154","Again, we know the beats by heart, but there’s a reason A Christmas Carol has been told every which way from Muppets to Disney. You can’t help getting swept up in it, even if you’ve heard it all before.","67","6225520"
"10155","Anyone merely hoping for more gravity-defying fight sequences will be reasonably satisfied by Sword Of Destiny, which chugs along amiably enough and never goes very long without a skirmish of some sort.","67","2652118"
"10156","What it does have is the laughs.","67","455967"
"10157","Cartoonishly violent and proudly profane, The Predator is like a Hollywood action movie pulled into our reality from an alternate timeline.","67","3829266"
"10158","For every moment that feels overly self-serious, there are two that promise this thing’s some kind of pop-schlock classic.","67","2140479"
"10159","The reveal is a bit predictable, but a couple of fake-outs keep things interesting along the way.","67","5308322"
"10160","With Infinitely Polar Bear, Forbes has created a warm family portrait, even though it sugarcoats the specter that mental illness casts on this group’s well-being.","67","1969062"
"10161","Batman Returns offers many jolts of pleasure, yet it’s also a mess — a gilded sketchbook of a movie that keeps falling open to random pages.","67","103776"
"10162","The endearing chemistry between these characters and the movie’s breezy tone often clashes with the subject at hand. That creates a peculiar dissonance whenever the movie attempts to dig deep on matters of faith, or the bleaker controversies involving the Catholic Church today.","67","8404614"
"10163","Dense, meandering, ambitious yet jarringly pulpy, this tale of big-city corruption in small-town America has competence without mood or power -- a design but not a vision.","67","118887"
"10164","The film's best moments are those focused on combat, and Ayer does a tremendous job of creating the details of daily life for a combat tank team in the waning days of WWII.","67","2713180"
"10165","Barry loses its way when it reduces itself to a tacky diorama of its protagonist’s inner turmoil, and it does so frequently enough to dismantle any sense of narrative momentum.","67","5477566"
"10166","The result is a monolithic slab of Biblical fan fiction, at once deeply serious and seriously silly. It’s a mess, but at least it’s the mess its creators wanted.","67","1959490"
"10167","Colette is a good primer for a wonderful author, and a reflection on how your life will never turn out as you think.","67","5437928"
"10168","There's no denying the kick you get from seeing Borgnine (forever lovelorn Marty to me, when he's not tooling around my head as Cabbie, from John Carpenter's Escape From New York) and company kick ass, take names, and go batshit crazy one last time.","67","1245526"
"10169","The Sorcerer's Apprentice is too long, and it's ersatz magic, but at least it casts an ersatz spell.","67","963966"
"10170","It may be an elevator pitch stretched to 90 minutes, and never aspires to more than that, but it's a fine and distinct funhouse ride designed to elicit cackles, then be forgotten about by the next ride.","67","7752126"
"10171","While it’s loaded with excellent ensemble performances and flashes of real poignancy, it can’t seem to help itself from occasionally jack-knifing into heavy-handed wrong turns that can play as clichéd or phony. It’s half of a great movie.","67","6662736"
"10172","Big Eyes has plenty of surface pleasures, but there was reason to expect more than that from it.","67","1126590"
"10173","The problem is that so little about Hooper's Les Misérables feels integrated. The cast feels like a grab bag of talented stage vets and garish stunt-casting choices, particularly Baron Cohen and Bonham Carter, who perform the fan-favorite comic number ""Master Of The House"" as a jerky, staccato series of show-off moves and attempted but inadequate scene-stealing.","67","1707386"
"10174","The film is an audience-pleaser, but very calculated and far from Curtis' best work: His script will go to any lengths to be cute, and his direction tends to be overly broad. In the end, he wears us out with the sheer volume of witty and endearing characters.","67","314331"
"10175","It’s at once an encore, a postscript, and a fresh start.","67","2848292"
"10176","Velvet Buzzsaw is a messy movie, and not just in the sense that Gilroy ends up painting a room with blood at one point.","67","7043012"
"10177","It's a daring failure that should delight many devotees of Classic Hollywood.","67","297884"
"10178","This can be pretty fun, but also tiring in stretches; Leitch’s fetishistic interest in clothes, scar tissue, furniture, and different shades of mood lighting and lens flare gives some of the action-less portions of Atomic Blonde a glazed-over, narcotic pace.","67","2406566"
"10179","Filled with energy and visual pizzazz and at least strives for something more than dumb entertainment.","67","811080"
"10180","Unlike King, Darabont ends this story with a drop kick to the cerebellum, a change from the original that shocks the viewer and leave little doubt that Darabont thinks we're all headed to hell in a hand basket.","67","884328"
"10181","It’s all fitfully sharp and amusing but hardly a masterpiece.","67","4048272"
"10182","A fitfully entertaining movie in an awkward position; too arty for the action crowd yet too unsubtle for more refined tastes.","67","993842"
"10183","These days it's going to take a pretty exceptional political thriller to top our political reality for sheer suspense and treachery, and though director Ray (Shattered Glass) provides a few choice moments of psychological tension, nothing in his film can hope to outpace the anxiety caused by the appearance of former Attorney General John Ashcroft in its opening scene.","67","401997"
"10184","If it's possible to be a rip-off with wit, Disturbia qualifies.","67","486822"
"10185","This is precisely the type of movie we expect to see at the summer box office; an incessantly entertaining and dangerous adventure that will leave you breathless.","67","8364368"
"10186","Never Look Away seems as self-satisfied with itself as its fictional artists are with the works they produce. Pardon my disgruntlement, but after three hours, my tendency is to desire a more resounding ending and something less solipsistic.","67","5311542"
"10187","Every actor gives their all, even when the material is insultingly thin.","67","3236120"
"10188","The fact Tomlin is so good also highlights the film's biggest problem. Too much of what works in Grandma comes from the subtle touches Tomlin, Elliott and Harden bring to their characters, not Weitz’s script.","67","4270516"
"10189","Ad Astra is, for all other intents and purposes, as straight faced as they come, a film that considers the big questions of interplanetary travel and contact but signposts its conclusions too early–and can’t help getting bogged down by them.","67","2935510"
"10190","Like The Flintstones and The Beverly Hillbillies before it, The Brady Bunch Movie is an amusing facsimile of a pop culture archetype. If only the script had been given such attention to detail. [17 Feb 1995, p.3]","67","112572"
"10191","The amiable and undemanding Meyerowitz evokes so many other media — television, short story, theater — that it’s a little unclear as to quite why it’s a film.","67","5536736"
"10192","Jones makes a fine Ginsburg – especially in the mouth, lips pursed expectantly – but something in Hammer’s resigned manner paints a Marty that is more ineffectual than stoic, and the chemistry between them is pretty middle-of-the-road.","67","4669788"
"10193","Shanghai Triad doesn't feel up to Zhang's usual standards.","67","115012"
"10194","The movie is written and directed by the British filmmaker Richard Curtis, who specializes in fantasies — the dozen intersecting rom-coms of ""Love Actually"" the fairy-tale courtship of ""Notting Hill"", the endless receptions of ""Four Weddings And A Funeral."" At a glance, About Time appears to be of a piece with those crowd-pleasers.","67","2194499"
"10195","The Purge clearly has a lot on its mind, but it never really manages to express it.","67","2184339"
"10196","Shouldering a laconic-good-guy, neo- Gary Cooper role, Robbins never quite makes emotional contact with the audience.","67","111161"
"10197","Has a sweaty, weary, often intimate feel, with the human aspect dominating the mechanistic. Donner can't help but push it over the top now and again, like a bodybuilder flexing his muscles when he spots a potential mate. But he contents himself with aiming for small virtues more often than grand impact.","67","450232"
"10198","It has a couple of nice reversals, two or three good laugh lines, and a caustic but not too acid skewering of cultural institutions. It goes down easy, it’s relatively unmemorable and it’s fine. Close, on the other hand, is exquisite.","67","3750872"
"10199","Jack Goes Boating tells a tender story reasonably well, but it rarely lets viewers feel the emotions instead of thoughtfully observing them.","67","1278379"
"10200","I'm not sure if this is a failing of the play, the actor, the director, or whatever, but it's a nagging perplexity at the center of this story. Yet there's so much else going on here, ideas and lines of thought that it engenders, that it's difficult not to enjoy the experiences. It's also bitingly funny.","67","108149"
"10201","As Sam, the wayward stepsister of Charlie's sardonic friend Patrick (Ezra Miller), Watson doesn't lose her cool, or her warmth, in a role that might easily have devolved into terminal sappiness.","67","1659337"
"10202","Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage inject tasty bits of personality into their roles.","67","117500"
"10203","French director Jean-Jacques Annaud, who brought his interest in self-discovery and untamed places to Quest for Fire, The Lover, and the IMAX 3-D film Wings of Courage, is at his best re-creating the serene exoticism of the Dalai Lama's Tibet. But the spark of the holy that the Dalai Lama lights in Harrer flickers only fitfully in all the wind in this production.","67","120102"
"10204","It's hard to imagine how anyone could remain dry-eyed while watching the scene in which John Q. tries to cram in a lifetime of fatherhood advice in a goodbye speech to his son.","67","251160"
"10205","It is ridiculous, cheesy popcorn fun. And Statham, God bless him, knows exactly what kind of guilty pleasure he’s signed on for — Sharknado with a bigger budget and a much bigger monster.","67","4779682"
"10206","Your Highness is awfully vulgar fun when it works, which is much of the time (although it could've benefited from a few judicious cuts here and there).","67","1240982"
"10207","It’s an enticing challenge for the writer-director to develop a stylish mood piece out this flimsy material, adapted from a Jonathan Ames novella as a series of textured moments. The movie is an elegant homage to a mold of scrappy detective stories that often collapses into a concise pileup of stylish possibilities.","67","5742374"
"10208","It’s as though Hill wrote a much longer script and decided to ultimately pare everything down without realizing just how hollow he was rendering supporting players in the process.","67","5613484"
"10209","A number of scenes have been staged with satisfying kinetic flair, and Willis once again makes an appealing superhero. Yet without that great big booby-trapped skyscraper to hold the action together, the suspense dissipates.","67","99423"
"10210","Seth Green is uproarious as an Amish farmer who speaks in sentences so passive-aggressive, they're like tiny slaps.","67","1135985"
"10211","What made “District 9” special was attention to details: You believed in the characters, their society and their surroundings. The big effects in Elysium work fine. But the people never become individuals, and the vagueness and coincidental nature of the storytelling undermine its structure.","67","1535108"
"10212","It’s shallow, it’s boring, it’s poignant, it’s clever, it’s poorly acted, it’s intentionally poorly acted, it has no story, it has marvelous scenes, it is artful, it is hallucinatory, it is shoddily put together. All response is valid.","67","2101441"
"10213","The recurring fight scenes had a campy quality that recalled the funniest flicks from Hong Kong. [30 June 1995, p.11]","67","113820"
"10214","Best when it's morphing into seriousness. Too often the comic bits seem like sops to the audience.","67","1341188"
"10215","Zach Braff has come up with a charming, funny, melancholy ode to twentysomething angst.","67","333766"
"10216","The fun of Wild Things -- and there's a lot of it -- is in its never-ending game of cross and double cross.","67","120890"
"10217","Warrior resists many opportunities to seal an easy resolution, and for this you remain with it until the final punch.","67","1291584"
"10218","For all its good performances and family values, it's a painful movie to endure. It consists of watching this poor guy suffer one agonizing setback after another for nearly two hours, and its modest emotional payoff comes only in the final moments.","67","454921"
"10219","This film is both too formulaic and too much a one-man vehicle to rate as a true masterpiece. But God strike me dead if I'm lying, this is one gut-busting funny movie.","67","119528"
"10220","Above the Law is action trash. But it's great action trash, running fast and furious from the first frame to the last. It's entirely possible - in fact, advisable - to forget the movie's right-to-left-wing political swings and just watch Seagal rage. [22 Apr 1988, p.7]","67","94602"
"10221","This movie purposely inspires viewers to think about serious topics, and then disregards the consequences of doing so, undermining the whole enterprise. The final physical sensation is not terror or relief, but disgust.","67","4786282"
"10222","Ok, I admit at first I was just laughing at the sheer gutsiness of South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. But after 10 minutes, I was laughing at the script.","67","158983"
"10223","By the end, 1917 has positioned itself as a salute to the sacrifices of those who died for their country. Mostly, though, it comes across as a monument to itself.","67","8579674"
"10224","As a whole, the film has too little character and/or plot development to sustain narrative interest. What A Scanner Darkly excels at is mood and tone.","67","405296"
"10225","Filmmakers Boden and Fleck don’t appear interested in eliciting your full-out sympathy for these low-rollers, though the happyish ending seems somewhat a sellout (albeit a satisfactory one). Who’s to blame them? After all, everybody loves a winner.","67","2349144"
"10226","The whole thing is a step above studio romantic comedies, but that's not saying much.","67","1405365"
"10227","A mortal movie about an immortal subject and the very fact that it succeeds as well as it does is a testament to Lee's skills as a filmmaker.","67","104797"
"10228","His performance in Gold, as Kenny Wells, isn’t quite up to his Oscar-winning work in ""Dallas Buyers Club,"" but it’s nevertheless a rousing feat without which this movie would have far less to recommend it.","67","1800302"
"10229","Midnight Express is at war with itself. Strong when it focuses on the psychological toll of prison, it falls apart when it turns the focus elsewhere, and its depictions of all Turks as swarthy, corrupt, and sadistic is pretty inexcusable.","67","77928"
"10230","What we get is more of the same from Ferrell – funny faces, goofy accents, pratfalls aplenty – and that ain't bad. It just could have been a lot better.","67","357413"
"10231","In the end, all the sorrow and horror and anger and angst just seem pointless despite Corbet’s stated intention to juxtapose the meaningless against the tragic.","67","5960374"
"10232","I rather like the whole mystic- crystal-revelations aspect of K-PAX, and the idea that even a psychiatrist of Jeff Bridges' handsome, American substantiality is open to notions of cosmic improbability.","67","272152"
"10233","Depp and Rush are still in there plugging away. They’re troupers, but the series is all used up. If there is to be another sequel it will have to be called ""Pirates of the Caribbean – At Wit's End.""","67","449088"
"10234","Even Helen Mirren, the Queen Midas of class acting, can’t fix this well-intentioned miss.","67","2404425"
"10235","After meandering for a while, the story kicks into gear in the third act, with a couple of legitimately shocking and well-executed developments that do pack a punch missing elsewhere in the film.","67","1646971"
"10236","Kendrick’s interplay with Lively’s big, alluringly langurous temptress is deliciously diverting, but the script could have used some judicious editing; a surfeit of credibility-straining, overly antic plot developments crowd the last third of the film, which until then had an intriguingly languid pace.","67","7040874"
"10237","Emily Bergl plays the misfit heroine -- pale Goth grrrl Rachel Lang -- with a nicely sulky empathy, equal parts hurt and hope.","67","144814"
"10238","The bad news in this kinder, gentler, more subtle performance is that, by playing the woman (Streep) as less of a devil, the dynamic that propels the story loses much of its drive and energy, and what's left is a kind of high-class ""Gidget"" movie.","67","458352"
"10239","Though told in broad strokes, its version of the story deserves credit for never buying into the hype and surreal pageantry of the Astrodome showdown. But its lack of interest in tennis as a sport leaves the narrative—plastered with hot-button issues and character crises—with an empty center.","67","4622512"
"10240","Øvredal is to be commended for simultaneously staying true to a beloved franchise and twisting its head around to face in an unexpected direction. Thanks to him, the film isn’t just a collection of scary stories. It’s a meditation on why the stories we tell ourselves shape us and why that’s the scary bit.","67","3387520"
"10241","The bromance often seems generic, too. Fishburne gives a highly nuanced performance, one of his best, as he allows us to see in this man of God flashes of the rogue he once was. But the movie ultimately must be defined by Doc, and we never really get inside his head.","67","6018306"
"10242","Green and Henson make an inspired comic team, Sawa has the befuddled stoner thing down pat, and Alba is, in a word, yummy.","67","138510"
"10243","You're guaranteed never to have seen anything like it; objectively speaking, it's a wonder.","67","372588"
"10244","So many oddities are thrown in our faces that The Frighteners becomes measured by its occasional imaginative moments, rather than as a complete entertainment. [19 July 1996, p.5]","67","116365"
"10245","There are certainly worse ways to spend the holiday season than in the company of two charming old actors, being reminded that human companionship makes life worth living, even as it makes dying a little tougher.","67","825232"
"10246","Now that it is at last on screen, my reaction is ... what's all the fuss?","67","294870"
"10247","The script, partly written by an uncredited Terry George (""Some Mother's Son,"" ""In the Name of the Father"") strains mightily for insight but never quite breaks through.","67","118972"
"10248","Allen (Raiders of the Lost Ark) is ideally cast as the mom, and as the step-dad, Leary gets a break from his bad boy of MTV image. The Sandlot is truly one about the boys of summer.","67","108037"
"10249","Deft and fast-moving, but shouldn’t a musical have at least a few songs you can hum on your way home?","67","875034"
"10250","Works more in your head than on the screen.","67","163988"
"10251","Rodriguez makes the same mistake as other first-time auteurs: The world of this movie exists only in relation to other movies, particularly the Sergio Leone-Clint Eastwood spaghetti Westerns of the early '60s.","67","104815"
"10252","Neither bloodthirsty enough to trigger the gag reflex of anyone but the most anemic viewer nor clever enough to yield much in the way of particularly engrossing insights.","67","144084"
"10253","Nowhere near the Hollywood disaster that was foretold, Waterworld is a near-model summer fantasy: two hours and 21 minutes of loud, expansive fun.","67","114898"
"10254","The new version of “Pet Sematary” is both darkly humorous and quite chilling, modernizing some of the cheesier emotional beats of that earlier adaptation. ... It’s in the third act that Kolsch and Widmyer’s ambitions get the best of them.","67","837563"
"10255","The darker stuff begs to be handled less delicately than this dance, and in that respect the director stumbles.","67","308383"
"10256","Despite some pacing troubles and myriad undeveloped characters, Motherless Brooklyn functions well enough as a throwback to the intelligent, atmospheric studio private investigator dramas to which it tips a velvety fedora, and shows evidence that this dormant genre still has legs.","67","385887"
"10257","The movie's biggest surprise may be that the story we think we know from modern scary cinema - that horror is a fun, cosmic game, not much else - here turns out to be pretty much the whole enchilada.","67","1259521"
"10258","May not be as successful as it is ambitious, but you could do worse than to spend a few hours there.","67","120789"
"10259","The most succinct evidence that Shakespeare was a fraud is offered by Derek Jacobi in prologue and epilogue, alone on a Broadway stage before a rapt audience. As usual in matters of the Bard, the play's the thing.","67","1521197"
"10260","Ridley Scott has made two iconic sci-fi films, ""Alien"" (1979) and ""Blade Runner"" (1982). Trying for a hat trick with Prometheus, he comes up short. I'll say this much for it – it's not boring.","67","1446714"
"10261","And yet, for all those weaknesses, this is a Steven Spielberg film, of the kind only Steven Spielberg can make. Big, raucous, heartfelt, referential, and unabashed in celebrating the culture he has always loved.","67","1677720"
"10262","I wouldn't call Catwoman incompetent, yet it has no visual grandeur, and very little surprise; you can tick off the story beats as if they'd been graphed.","67","327554"
"10263","The movie is creepy, but it has no texture or depth. It's like ""The Omen"" directed by Miranda July.","67","1242460"
"10264","Harriet doesn’t reinvent the biopic formula, but Erivo’s performance injects a palpable urgency to the material that makes up for missed time.","67","4648786"
"10265","Bana and McAdams are sweet together, with matching dimples and starry eyes, and we grow eager to see them remain in the same place. In the end, that's all there is to the movie, really. It's a time-travel fantasy in search of a cozy love seat.","67","452694"
"10266","Shrek, DreamWorks' big green cash machine, has finally run dry, perhaps not of box office power, but most assuredly of the caustic, fractured fairy tale-isms and the wry, snarky wit that made the first film, and to a lesser degree, the first sequel, so winning.","67","413267"
"10267","A Quiet Place is an entertaining and crowd-pleasing monster movie, one that leaves you wanting more—and once you get over wondering what a subtler and more accomplished director might have done with this material, it’s not hard to let yourself be won over by its charms.","67","6644200"
"10268","For the viewer, however, solving this mystery is not nearly as engrossing as watching the actors’ pas de deux.","67","2431286"
"10269","Invictus has an understated grace, but too often it comes across as hero-worshipy.","67","1057500"
"10270","Although this version of Beowulf (the script, ricocheting between thrilling, heroic, and hilarious, is by Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary) does take some liberties with certain heretofore undreamed of aspects of parentage, it's as faithful to the extant version as it needs to be.","67","442933"
"10271","Plenty of credit is due to Barbara Curry’s deranged script, set in a suburban fantasyland of doofus bullies, junior proms, and middle-class sex fears; it probably isn’t meant to be a Verhoeven satire, but it sure moves like one.","67","3181822"
"10272","It can be a grueling experience considering the heavy subject matter, but there’s enough optimism to stave off boredom.","67","5881892"
"10273","It’s likely to be enjoyed more by audiences unfamiliar with the original.","67","1034415"
"10274","This is high-quality work from a professional (Gibson) who, news reports have suggested, has recently sunk to terrible lows in his nonprofessional life.","67","1321860"
"10275","By the time Li enters the obligatory ''ring of fire'' to face his final opponent, you realize just how forthrightly rote and businesslike ''Cradle'' is. And you don't mind. Because business, it turns out, is good.","67","306685"
"10276","My only regret is that the film could not somehow take a leap forward to 1988. I would love to have seen what Lee and Will could do with ""Die Hard.""","67","845046"
"10277","When Cohen and Ferrell are eyeing each other, you never saw a loopier pair.","67","415306"
"10278","Aja's version, while a killer ride in its own right, never manages the nagging subtexts Craven so handily injected into the proceedings. It's a topnotch nightmare, but this time you wake up.","67","454841"
"10279","The film's greatest strength lies in its ability to view itself as a modern moral fable of sorts.","67","120903"
"10280","Slight but agreeable picture.","67","1321509"
"10281","Spielrein's name is less familiar than the others, but the film suggests she deserves to be more than a footnote in the history of psychoanalysis.","67","1571222"
"10282","It may be that the Hulk role was not made for sensitive method actors like Norton or Bana. When '70s TV-""Hulk"" Lou Ferrigno made his obligatory cameo, a palpable wave of affection swept through the Seattle preview audience.","67","800080"
"10283","It's just the kind of film that you'd expect a jury led by Quentin Tarantino to choose, a bloody and brutal revenge film immersed in madness and directed with operatic intensity.","67","364569"
"10284","For all its amazing high points (and this satirically minded takedown of the ludicrousness of the American racist right has many of those) BlacKkKlansman also shows Lee at his weakest. The slight running time drags, a sensation not helped by Terence Blanchard's underwhelming score.","67","7349662"
"10285","Upgrade is a welcome excuse to put Marshall-Green through some delightfully complex fight choreography.","67","6499752"
"10286","As is the norm for Ritchie, Rocknrolla is also too long, too coolly violent, and too populated by characters who all talk like they've been reading the same pulp novelist.","67","1032755"
"10287","Some of the riffs are really funny and/or expertly scary. Others have the feel of awfully snappy dialogue crafted by middleaged people trying a little too eagerly to sound like the young people from whose mouths the banter flows.","67","1262416"
"10288","It's not only light, it's thin. It's self-deprecating to a fault. Reynolds is required to practically wink at the audience, as if to say,""I know this looks silly.""","67","1133985"
"10289","The characters are not hugely compelling, the performances never completely grab us, and much of the story, while visually arresting, is dramatically tedious.","67","783233"
"10290","Director Henry Selick is all too effective at conjuring grody ghastliness. He's less effective at giving that ghastliness a human dimension, a resonance, a reason for being beyond cheap thrills.","67","327597"
"10291","Here and there an inspired shot makes the film come alive, and at least three of its sequences had me positioned well on the edge of my seat.","67","183523"
"10292","Even Watchmen fanatics may be doomed to a disappointment that results from trying to stay THIS faithful to a comic book.","67","409459"
"10293","Sadly, it’s hamstrung by a patchy script (by David Hare) and an oddly flat-footed performance by Rachel Weisz as Lipstadt.","67","4645330"
"10294","Reiner abandons his previous movie's sense of farce and satire for much broader and more innocuous comedy.","67","93779"
"10295","Equity is more nuanced, if not as ferociously confidant as that 1987 Oliver Stone film, here focusing on the nitty gritty of a market launch of a social media-style security company.","67","3958780"
"10296","For all the nimbleness of its first half and the chemical zing of Pitt and Jolie, the film devolves into a fractious and explosive mess, hitting the same note of ''ironic'' violence over and over.","67","356910"
"10297","De Palma's direction shines, but noir script doesn't match his gifts.","67","387877"
"10298","The old formula is showing its age. The movie just doesn't deliver the emotional highs that addicted millions to the Rocky cycle. For the first time, one does not leave the theater floating on air. [16 Nov 1990, p.8]","67","100507"
"10299","Just Mercy is incredibly effective at what it sets out to do: change hearts and minds about capital punishment, bring more awareness to the brutality of killing other human beings in the name of the law, and highlight the racism and other issues of structural inequality that lead to the high margin of error in death penalty convictions.","67","4916630"
"10300","A fascinating, masterly, frustrating film, it only passingly touches on the heart and sharpness of Anderson's previous work and rather brings to mind the famous complaint of the emperor in ""Amadeus"": ""too many notes.""","67","362270"
"10301","It's far from unenjoyable, but the dank shroud of the overfamiliar lies heavy over all, kind of like watching an Elvis concert circa 1976.","67","120347"
"10302","Belongs to that distinctly '90s genre of sadistic crime comedy whose time has clearly come and gone.","67","208092"
"10303","Subtitled “A Street Romance,” writer-director Singleton's sophomore effort touches the heart more when it's on the street than when it's making romance.","67","107840"
"10304","Grim, post-apocalyptic, special-effects extravaganza.","67","438488"
"10305","Despite its virtues and intriguingly complicated morality, Queen & Slim never rises above its initial premise which is so not credible that it hoovers all ensuing tension from the rest of the film. Ridiculous can’t sustain a two hour–plus running time, and the stronger the filmmakers stick with their fire-breathing idea, the more frustrating Queen & Slim becomes, stomping out any connection to a reality most of us would recognize.","67","8722346"
"10306","Hook is jam-packed with ''entertainment value,'' enough to give you your money's worth, and to guarantee (in all probability) that Spielberg earns his. Yet something has clouded this director's vision... The problem isn't that Spielberg has lost his gift for fantasy. It's that he no longer seems to know (or care) about anything else.","67","102057"
"10307","Banderas’ performance is so rich, in fact (he won Best Actor at Cannes), that it creates the illusion of a narrative with real depth and texture—he keeps us invested in Salvador even as the film repeatedly declines to complicate the man’s life any further.","67","8291806"
"10308","Gleeson is a wonderful actor and he keeps a lid on the blarney. He manages to convey a lot – fear, anger, compassion, rue – with only the slightest of squints and frowns. But he’s still the center of a cooked-up cavalcade of souls.","67","2234003"
"10309","If you've a mind to see a classic fairy tale rendered as an action movie, and if you want to see a sizeable handful of fine English actors have grand fun playing grizzled dwarves, there are worse ways to spend two hours than in the company of Snow White and the Huntsman.","67","1735898"
"10310","Possible unmet expectations aside, Color of Night remains compelling for a number of reasons. Foremost among them is Bruce Willis, who gives a quietly persuasive performance.","67","109456"
"10311","Rush, in other words, is a foursquare sportsmanship movie, offering little in the way of surprises but plenty of earnest, satisfying thrills.","67","1979320"
"10312","Overwritten and overcooked, Remember Me still manages a few explosive sequences between Pattinson and Pierce Brosnan.","67","1403981"
"10313","The story line is the typical M:I labyrinthine mess, made even more confusing by the always challenging Robert Towne as screenwriter, and by the continuation and overuse of the flawlessly lifelike ""mask"" device established in Part One.","67","120755"
"10314","This may be Iannucci’s weakest-written film, but it’s by far his best-directed one.","67","4686844"
"10315","It gives nothing of the plot away to say that there's a fine line between an ''Aha!'' and an ''Oh, brother!'' Whether you feel The Village crosses that line may hinge on whether you think Shyamalan's screenwriting ability is beginning to lag behind his skill as a director.","67","368447"
"10316","It may not sound like much of a storyline, but there’s a subtle beauty in the ability of human compassion to cure one’s shortcomings.","67","3722070"
"10317","An eminently watchable B-movie nightmare.","67","164052"
"10318","It's mad, bad nonsense of the summer, popcorn variety, disposable but oh-so-much fun to endure, a roller coaster on a wobbly cinematic track.","67","337921"
"10319","James Caan is excellent as the writer and Kathy Bates is brilliant as his captor. Unfortunately, what could have been a seamless psychological thriller is interrupted by violence that's as gratuitous as it is sadistic.","67","100157"
"10320","Coarser, more hectic, more cheaply written sequel.","67","266915"
"10321","Great effects and a nasty undercurrent drive this vehicle.","67","93870"
"10322","Assuming that rich human insight, great production values, and topnotch acting still count for something, Mrs. Brown should have no trouble finding an appreciative audience.","67","119280"
"10323","Which is more interesting: Vampires fighting over the potential long-term blowback of their Alaskan buffet, or a couple of exes bonding under duress? Seems like an easy decision, but 30 Days Of Night makes the wrong choice.","67","389722"
"10324","The fact that Ed's life has been channeled into entertainment never achieves much tension or comic zest. That's because Howard thinks in cookie-cutter ''situations'' to begin with.","67","131369"
"10325","At times, the movie excels at portraying the dread of children forced to confront a world indifferent to their concerns. But no matter how many times Pennywise leaps out from unexpected places, it’s impossible to shake the feeling that we’ve been here many times before.","67","1396484"
"10326","An unsteady mishmash of snot-nosed humor and treacly Hollywood sentimentality.","67","389860"
"10327","As expected, the real flexes come from the four principal stars. Winter seamlessly slides back into his flannel as Bill, wisely dialing things down to address the years. However, Reeves dials it down too much, coming off as nearly geriatric as he shuffles around as his buddy Ted.","67","1086064"
"10328","For all its novelty and craft, Joker is more of a stylish stunt than anything else.","67","7286456"
"10329","For all of the effort invested in limning the specific contours of Jared’s struggle, Boy Erased stops just short of its core.","67","7008872"
"10330","Marigold Hotel achieves what it sets out to do: Sell something safe and sweet, in a vivid foreign setting, to an underserved share of the moviegoing market.","67","1412386"
"10331","Get On Up too often plays it safe when it needs to be dangerous.","67","2473602"
"10332","An extended framing device set in the present day, with Kathy Bates as a put-upon housewife who becomes the fierce, confident, new-and-improved ”Tawanda,” is the sort of ghastly idea that gives feminism a bad name. The movie left me wishing its sterling cast — including a radiant Jessica Tandy — had been better served.","67","101921"
"10333","Has many affecting moments, but you may tire of the tugging on your heart strings.","67","124315"
"10334","Gross, sophomoric, offensive, nasty, cheap and mean -- and so funny again and again that you plumb near forget all that's reprehensible about it.","67","175142"
"10335","Lucy doesn't hold together, but with its flashy innovation, Besson's trying to freshen the formula. It's the kind of freewheeling mess of a movie you wish studios would try out more often.","67","2872732"
"10336","It's bound to be the love-it-or-hate-it movie of 2003.","67","266697"
"10337","Columbus' film version is fine, and it's bound to make kids happy while simultaneously generating untold box office, but if you haven't yet picked up a copy, don't let the film override the novel; set aside a weekend, dive in, and then head off to the cineplex to take in this well-done companion piece.","67","241527"
"10338","Eastwood gets all noirish for us but, like Jolie's performance, there's a rote quality to it all. Even the mournful little ditties that Eastwood composed for the soundtrack seem canned.","67","824747"
"10339","Despite not breaking any new cinematic ground. The Rover plays like a taut spellbinder.","67","2345737"
"10340","The movie shifts awkwardly from slapstick firearms training sessions to tender campfire kisses to straightforward suspense (who are those mysterious trench-coated figures?). Combined with unconvincing behavior from all of its characters, that's enough to leave this a disappointing realization of a potentially fascinating idea.","67","1862079"
"10341","It doesn't, as they say, really work -- but it's enjoyable enough in spots to leave one feeling passably entertained.","67","203009"
"10342","Life of Pi, ironically, soars when it confines itself to land and sea; when it grasps for the celestial, the film goes beyond its reach.","67","454876"
"10343","Like the character of Rocky, it's got heart to spare, and is by turns one of the sweetest of the sweet-science pictures as well as one of the most doleful. Fighters fight, it's what they do. And Balboa, god bless him, fights on.","67","479143"
"10344","A constant movement unmoored from all but the present moment (however porously “present” is defined here) pushes Nolan forward as a visual stylist and suspense-crafter — lots of portent in the images of armies and crafts, plenty of faith in his actors to look concerned or outright distressed — as it stalls out Dunkirk in most other respects.","67","5013056"
"10345","A traffic map of calls and responses, lessons and homework, wishes and fulfillment. All roads lead to acting-award nominations, but none lead to truth.","67","285742"
"10346","If ""The Others"" is this year's paean to “quiet” horror, then Jeepers Creepers is its down 'n' dirty, punk rock, rip-your-throat-out-and-feed-it-to-you bastard child.","67","263488"
"10347","The next step in Matthew McConaughey's inevitable march to network television is The Lincoln Lawyer, a pilot disguised as a feature-length movie, with an entire season's arc crammed into two hours.","67","1189340"
"10348","Unlike the polished universe of Pixar's ""Brave"" or countless other recent CGI efforts, ParaNorman maintains a delicate, handcrafted look that underscores its ideas.","67","1623288"
"10349","A little bit obsessed with replication.","67","253754"
"10350","The film itself doesn’t practice what it preaches: From the typically blocky DreamWorks CGI to the emphasis on bruising slapstick over verbal wit, The Croods takes the low road at every opportunity, giving lip service to enlightenment while following a Flintstonian instinct to keep punching the clock at the quarry.","67","481499"
"10351","Honeydripper’s story isn’t anything you haven’t seen a dozen times before, but where Sayles succeeds (where Sayles always succeeds) is in his ability to dramatize the psychological and linguistic details that give identity to a subculture struggling for survival.","67","829193"
"10352","There's more than a trace of James Dean in Gosling, except that he's a rebel with a cause.","67","488120"

"10354","The filmmakers don’t endorse Michael’s solipsism, but we’re stuck with it anyway – the film is entirely from his point of view, save a lovely, pacifying final shot.","67","2401878"
"10355","What saves I Love You, Man, at least partially, is the relaxed chemistry between Paul Rudd and Jason Segel, both very funny men who are genuine enough to push back against a premise that's often maddeningly artificial.","67","1155056"
"10356","It's an energetic stunt of a movie, and it wants to make us sweat like it's 1974.","67","183649"
"10357","Apart from the movie's moments of flesh and fantasy, it lacks the lyric impulse that would make the swank fantasy take flight.","67","401445"
"10358","Unfortunately, once the ""be yourself"" story line is resolved (singing and dancing go together, who would have guessed?), the film is only half over.","67","366548"
"10359","Director Richard Ayoade (Submarine) gets a huge impact from minimal expressionist sets, but the thin story — loosely based on Dostoyevsky’s 1846 novella — plays like a pale reflection of a more exciting tale.","67","1825157"
"10360","Hall Pass would like to be as dunked in reality as Judd Apatow's best comedies, but the movie is thin. The Farrellys can't quite nudge the characters from two dimensions to three.","67","480687"
"10361","It's by far the most violent, most clinical and most sumptuously atmospheric.","67","120681"
"10362","An engaging if not riveting film based on David Benioff's adaptation of his own novel. It's not nearly Lee's best picture, and it's guilty of a few wrong turns that only a confident filmmaker could make, but it's assured and, perhaps more importantly, reassuring.","67","307901"
"10363","There are wonders here, but there are as many things that just plain make you wonder. By the end you're too addled to be truly moved.","67","368709"
"10364","Save for the thrilling opening sequence, there's not much to remember about the film beyond Staunton (Vera Drake), who masks her bottomless malevolence behind a pasted-on patrician smile.","67","373889"
"10365","Wanted is a queasily unapologetic power fantasy about becoming a better person through violence.","67","493464"
"10366","Ultimately more bleak and furious than most Hollywood tales of this sort. Man on Fire plays it out to the bloody end, like there’s no fire extinguisher in Mexico but for the oceans that hold its borders.","67","328107"
"10367","Chills to the bone -- and beyond, but for pure excitement it's best not to look far beneath the surface.","67","264616"
"10368","It's gory, really gory, gratuitously and often inelegantly.","67","212985"
"10369","The film never conveys that something larger is at work - like, say, the hand of fate. And without that, there's more busyness than beauty to Brontë.","67","1229822"
"10370","Sausage Party is a mixed bag of comedy, but when it finally has the gusto to ratchet things up on a visual level, the surrealistic vulgarity is something to be appreciated, even if you may feel assaulted once the lights come up.","67","1700841"
"10371","Little more than a gilded trifle, though it offers its share of light enjoyments.","67","824758"
"10372","As enjoyable as it is, it's hard to escape a sense of Analyze This being the work of competent talents who knew exactly where the good-enough line was and didn't feel particularly inspired to push far beyond it.","67","122933"
"10373","The film's lures, while undeniable, are synthetic, and we never do learn what fuels all the greed besides pints of beer.","67","120735"
"10374","But the movie's vital signs improve remarkably in the second half, and especially in the last act. The proceedings suddenly pick up some screwball charm, the writing improves (with several truly inspired one-liners tossed in here and there) and the secondary characters begin to click.","67","163187"
"10375","Wants to be both a hot-button, ripped-from-the-headlines statement movie and a crowd-pleasing, rip-roaring action thriller. It ends up meeting each goal about halfway.","67","431197"
"10376","Just when you're about to give up on this seemingly sorry excuse for an action movie, the picture does an about-face in a matter of minutes, and pushes the tension level way into overdrive and transforms suddenly into a solidly entertaining thriller.","67","116253"
"10377","It's big, it's stupid, it's pretty kick-ass.","67","120591"
"10378","Demme's filmmaking makes up in sincerity what it lacks in originality, and he gets a remarkable amount of emotional mileage from simple close-ups of expressive faces. [24 Dec 1993]","67","107818"
"10379","At its best, The Good Girl is a refreshingly adult take on adultery, where the dark humor and offbeat fringe characters don't get in the way of the consequences or the quiet declarations of devotion slipped between the words.","67","279113"
"10380","Garland is great at setting a tone of creepy ominousness, and the women’s foray into the swampy terrain is an unnerving blend of lustrous loveliness and split-second horror. But the visual effects throughout the film are often disconcertingly cheesy, and the pulp elements pile up with an extra serving of gore.","67","2798920"
"10381","The new Alfie is so irresistible that he hardly requires contempt. Without it, the movie is little more than a feature-length roll in the hay.","67","375173"
"10382","Vikander is a beautifully effective avatar for the American Ninja Warrior version of Lara Croft. Stripping down the bombast of the original games (and films) allows Uthaug’s reboot to feel comparatively grounded and immediate, without dragging itself down with unnecessary pathos.","67","1365519"
"10383","Despite the all-too-harrowing familiarity of these scenes, they seem more like illustrations than dramatizations of trauma.","67","1172991"
"10384","The saving grace of Kill Your Darlings is its sordid romantic angle, a narrative thread that pulls the film away from wink-wink allusions and into more serious emotional territory.","67","1311071"
"10385","The movie is a lot of fun if you don't think about it too much, the stuntwork should satisfy the genre fanatics in the crowd even though it doesn't set any new plateaus, and the rapport between Davis and Jackson is enough to keep the sticklers for realism in abeyance at least until the final credits roll.","67","116908"
"10386","A pleasantly vicarious slice of summertime falderol, innocuous in its presentation and often genuinely fun.","67","120746"
"10387","A Haneke who’s treading water is still a bizarrely entertaining filmmaker, but the fun is tinged with a hint of disappointment and a certain feeling of lost opportunity.","67","5304464"
"10388","It's as agreeably sweet as advertised, with a particularly yummy performance by Juliette Binoche.","67","241303"
"10389","Too bad the bulk of Rowling's humor goes down a black-magic drain.","67","330373"
"10390","It's certainly not a ""breakthrough"" comedy, unless the breakthrough is that women will flock to slobby, heartfelt romps starring Kristin Wiig instead of Seth Rogen. It's progress, sort of.","67","1478338"
"10391","This is a war film with precious little war, which was also the crux of Swofford's book.","67","418763"
"10392","Better in theory than in practice.","67","120910"
"10393","The subdued characters I can abide, intellectually speaking, but subdued filmmaking with material this fundamentally gut-punching is a lot less easy to swallow.","67","1334260"
"10394","A slick and exciting film","67","443274"
"10395","It's Besson's stunning visual fluency that takes center stage, and in the end, that's not quite enough.","67","151137"
"10396","Funny is funny, and it would be truly dishonest to deny the big laughs—the spikes of gut-busting inspiration—that the film sporadically delivers.","67","1245492"
"10397","Just as this series focuses on survival instincts, it seems that Scott has found a way to exercise his own, keeping the “Alien” series relevant by resurrecting the same old scares.","67","2316204"
"10398","You're set up for when director Richard Donner -- who worked with Gibson on all three audience-pleasing Weapons -- switches the movie from a really interesting, jittery, literate, and witty tone poem about justified contemporary paranoia (and the creatively unhinged dark side of New York City) to an overloaded, meandering iteration of a Lethal Weapon project that bears the not-so-secret stamp of audience testing and tinkering.","67","118883"
"10399","Actually, there's one other way to approach Matchstick Men, and that's to forget all about neuroses and con artistry and admire the movie instead for the unsettlingly beautiful directorial study in geographical mood that it is.","67","325805"
"10400","The lion’s share of the work then is on Bening and Bell’s shoulders to flesh out dramatically thin characters. That they do.","67","5711148"
"10401","By comparison with the other Rings movies - the extremely high bar Jackson has already set for himself - Unexpected Journey falls short and feels muddled, yet too eager to please its fan base with an obligatory swordfight every few scenes.","67","903624"
"10402","The cast is strong, though, and demonstrates yet again how good acting can carry audiences through movies that otherwise would not be worth the trip.","67","4971344"
"10403","Tom Hanks' appearances come across like scene changes between unfunny sketches on 'Saturday Night Live.'","67","1371111"
"10404","Whether intentionally intended or not, this earnest endeavor does wonders to enact sympathy and overturn any negative public perception of his outbursts, even if it can feel more like self-therapy than a fully-formed film.","67","8151874"
"10405","After a while, the director of the more perceptive ""Frances Ha"" and ""The Squid and the Whale"" tips his hand, painting the aging Xers as guardians of integrity and the millennials as opportunists. It’s a cheap shot, and it feels like he’s telling the kids to get off his lawn. It’s not Stiller’s character who’s the curmudgeon, it’s Baumbach.","67","1791682"
"10406","The best thing about Wonder Woman, the overlong and intermittently enjoyable new DC superhero spectacular, is Wonder Woman herself.","67","451279"
"10407","The whole thing is piffle, but it moves fast enough to stay entertaining.","67","814255"
"10408","It’s arguably Tarantino’s ugliest and most political film, but not his best by some distance.","67","3460252"
"10409","Victoria & Abdul is a movie that flirts with exploring prejudice, cultural tension, power, and religion, but never really consummates the ideas. At best, it tries to humorously dismantle the absurdity of empires and royalty, but that’s about as subversive as it gets.","67","5816682"
"10410","With beauty and talent to spare, Portman is something to behold: It's as if Elizabeth Taylor and Jodie Foster were somehow genetically melded at an early age. She's definitely a beautiful girl to watch for.","67","115639"
"10411","Leder establishes a syncopated rhythm unlike anything we're used to in a catastrophe spectacle.","67","120647"
"10412","It's not the most flattering depiction of Jews I've seen. Still, The Passion of the Christ is something of a masterpiece, terrible to behold, unfit for children, certainly, but very much the work of a director in the throes of his own distinct passion.","67","335345"
"10413","Watching the teen romance The Sun Is Also a Star, starring the splendid-looking young couple Yara Shahidi (Blackish) and Charles Melton (Riverdale’s Reggie)), is something like wading through fields of pink candy floss and suddenly finding a speck of grit.","67","6423362"
"10414","The Jerk‘s threadbare plot follows the brilliantly convoluted story.","67","79367"
"10415","This Life may not be everlasting, but it sure gives us a good run for our money.","67","123964"
"10416","The movie is zippier than Tim Burton's oddly lifeless 2001 ""Planet of the Apes"" remake, but unlike good sci-fi, it doesn't signify anything, or really even try to.","67","1318514"
"10417","Though hampered at times by Rock's limitations as an actor and a director, I Think I Love My Wife stays faithful to the spirit of Rohmer's original, grappling honestly with the uncertainties of settling down and the temptations that lurk outside even the most stable marriages.","67","770772"
"10418","It’s reasonably good, creepy fun, provided you’re not troubled by fleeting, uncomfortable thoughts like “Hey, that screaming bloodthirsty mutant monster could theoretically be a reanimated Anne Frank.”","67","4530422"
"10419","It’s a triumph of style over substance. But what style!","67","6241872"
"10420","While Red Sparrow ultimately doesn’t earn its all-consuming, grueling dourness, there are a few thrills to be had, and following the best performance of her career last fall, it’s certainly another fearless step forward for Jennifer Lawrence.","67","2873282"
"10421","There are limits to how much comic irony can be wrung out of the sight of two grown men acting like complete cretins.","67","109686"
"10422","Relentless and mercurial, this new outing by ""Swingers"" director Liman takes off somewhere around Mach 3 and never lets up, leaving you with either a pounding headache or a wicked grin, or perhaps both.","67","139239"
"10423","It's exhausting, impressionistic, and ultimately hollow, extraordinarily well-acted but not nearly as relevant as ""The Social Network.""","67","2080374"
"10424","It's nonstop chaos, and the everything-and-the-kitchen-sink style of comedy is taxing despite the frequent moments of pure comic genius.","67","371724"
"10425","A dumb film with a great conceptual hook from a director who visualizes better than he dramatizes.","67","467197"
"10426","Here's hoping that younger members of the audience will seek out Conan Doyle's original stories to further explore Holmes' official amanuensis, Dr. John Watson, whose brilliant case studies regarding his friend, roommate, and fellow rationalist are the stuff dreams are made of.","67","988045"
"10427","There's enough here for a nice little movie, anyway, even if Al Pacino didn't think so. He was hired to voice the movie's arch villain but dropped out due to ""creative differences.""","67","1690953"
"10428","Worse still, all that introspection adds up to a disappointingly shallow accumulation of regrets and life lessons, none of them surprising. After the adrenaline rush, 127 Hours turns to vapor.","67","1542344"
"10429","Interstellar, his (Nolan) sci-fi spectaculorama helixed around a father-daughter love story, is a gamble like no other in his career. It's his longest film, his headiest, his most personal. And, in its square-peg-in-a-round-wormhole stab at being the weepy motion-picture event of the year, it's also his sappiest.","67","816692"
"10430","For his first shot at feature filmmaking, Longo does an admirable job of keeping the story line rocketing along, though his seeming attempts to out-Blade Runner Ridley Scott in the decaying cityscape department grow wearisome and the occasional wooden drivel that Reeves spouts adds a bit of unintentional humor to the proceedings.","67","113481"
"10431","It’s a dirgelike odyssey sparked by Julianne Moore’s overheated turn as George’s best friend – a welcome respite from Firth’s clenched emoting.","67","1315981"
"10432","While slight, the film’s genuine feeling and overall comedic consistency has enough breezy charm to make it go down easy and pleasurably.","67","4501454"
"10433","A live-action Hammacher Schlemmer catalog of pseudo-retro novelties, spiced up with self-aware asides and over-the-top violence — slick entertainment, provided the viewer turns off whatever part of their brain is responsible for recognizing and parsing subtext.","67","2802144"
"10434","Still, this is recent and public history, and Fair Game, which both fascinates and infuriates, comes across as little more than a footnote in an ever-lengthening list (thanks, Wikileaks!) of the Bush White House's sordid, potentially treasonous actions leading up to and beyond the invasion of Iraq.","67","977855"
"10435","As is often the case with such violence, it eventually becomes numbing. By its midpoint, once the novelty of a superhero movie showing super levels of violence wears off, the thinness and lack of spark in the fight scenes becomes more readily apparent. By the film's end, they are hard to distinguish from any other superhero fare. Similarly, lack of imagination keep the film's prodigious swearing and occasional nudity from feeling like anything original.","67","1431045"
"10436","While Sanctum is frustratingly familiar, it's easy to get caught up in the action.","67","881320"
"10437","Night at the Museum ends up being a pretty fun all-ages comedy -- if you can survive its first 20 minutes.","67","477347"
"10438","Goldberg, for all her character's tough bluster, is sweet too: Her performance here is contained, modulated, dignified without cushioning the Whoopi edge that makes her work so interesting and uncategorizable.","67","112571"
"10439","Trash, but always just a little creepier than you expect.","67","185371"
"10440","Where drag is concerned, though, the film does anything but drag; Elliott has no compunction about restraint, and Priscilla gushes with bitchy repartee, campy comedy, sappy Seventies pop (Abba! “Billy, Don't Be a Hero”! “Take a Letter, Maria”!), and production numbers so outrageous, they make the Divine Miss M's excess look like the efforts of a Baptist boys' camp.","67","109045"
"10441","A sweet little comedy, as easygoing and warmly innocuous as the benign irony of the title.","67","805564"
"10442","The film is tense and engrossing. But it lacks exactly what the title advertises: the sense of inexplicable familiarity that should haunt you as the story unfolds and leave you all a-tingle when it ends.","67","453467"
"10443","The result, as might be expected, is strong on acting and overly stagey.","67","2671706"
"10444","Towers head and hairpiece above much of what passes for urban comedy these days.","67","303714"
"10445","10 Cloverfield Lane is a cinematic puzzle box that rewards your patience with three standout performances; a memorable, nerve-jangling score by composer Bear McCreary; and an escalating sense of disorienting confusion.","67","1179933"
"10446","Unsurprisingly for a Del Toro film, the production design is the real star of Crimson Peak.","67","2554274"
"10447","Isn't quite a home run: The visually flat film leans on a pop culture crutch that probably won't age very well, and the finale – while terrifically funny – feels piped in from another, far sillier movie.","67","405422"
"10448","A pleasant surprise. It's not without its problems, but it's character-driven, funny and, if not dark, then at least a pleasant shade of gray -- with tremendous performances by Hirsch and Olyphant.","67","265208"
"10449","Yet for a film so affectingly steeped in loss, resignation and the ghosts of memory, the revelation that pulls it all together, while satisfying and even touching, lacks emotional resonance.","67","371257"
"10450","Plenty of fun while it lasts, but its aftereffects are mighty fleeting.","67","185014"
"10451","It’s the kind of film that ultimately makes you count your blessings, root for the good guys, and maybe even shed a tear or two at the sight of the press kicking ass.","67","6294822"
"10452","A suspenseful breath of fresh air following on the heels of one of the dumbest Hollywood summers in recent memory.","67","146309"
"10453","While we can admire their attractive exteriors, we don't know anything about the interior lives of the three women so vibrantly miserable in their unhappiness.","67","274558"
"10454","At its height, Summer of ’84 sings like a sandy page-turner you end up finishing in the fall, with the wind swirling and mischief night just around the corner.","67","5774450"
"10455","An OK action film, but only the humorless will find it heretical – or educational.","67","808151"
"10456","Baker indulges just a little too much time shooting his young hyperactive actors in off-key locations and perhaps not enough on their character development or narrative arcs.","67","5649144"
"10457","Despite its predictability and sappiness, this conventional comedy about a worldly lounge singer who masquerades as a nun as part of a witness protection program busts loose as one of the funniest -- and happiest -- films in a long time.","67","105417"
"10458","Good, manic fun plus a heavy dose of political intrigue adding up to two hours of clamorous, mind-numbing nonsense.","67","1059786"
"10459","There are laughs to be had, yet the movie is, if anything, more strenuous than it is funny.","67","185431"
"10460","Saw is a gristle-cut B psycho thriller that would like to tap the sickest corners of your imagination. It has a few moments of nightmare creepiness, but it's also derivative and messy and too nonsensical for its own good.","67","387564"
"10461","Sandler and Watson make something out of their underwritten roles, and that they do is testament to their talents: They make this punchy romantic comedy more engaging than it should be.","67","272338"
"10462","His (Spielberg) is an old-fashioned style of moviemaking that can produce soaring entertainment or, alternately, a fussed-over theatricality. Minute to minute, Lincoln moves between these extremes.","67","443272"
"10463","As the movie moves through its murder mystery mode and begins racking up political points, Hank becomes a stand-in for all those Americans bewildered and beleaguered by the war. He becomes a Symbol.","67","478134"
"10464","Does Apatow understand his heroes are assholes?","67","1758830"
"10465","White Squall is lovely to look at, but frustrating to behold.","67","118158"
"10466","Boone’s unobtrusive style takes cues from the subdued nature of the material, but there’s little about the movie that makes the filmmaking stand out. Instead, it derives its chief strengths from a series of efforts to take the drama seriously, mainly embodied by Woodley’s onscreen investment in it.","67","2582846"
"10467","Rust and Bone is made by filmmakers and actors who are capable of much more – and they know it. The result is a true oddity: an orgy of hokum dressed up as an art film.","67","2053425"
"10468","The fact is that both actors are very good, even if trapped in the amber of Hooper's overweeningly tasteful direction.","67","810819"
"10469","The film is notable for its nice performances, its handsome photography, and its very active music. If the preceding praise sounds generic, so is the movie.","67","976051"
"10470","There's fun to be had in the re-creation of indelible screen moments, including several with Scarlett Johansson as Janet Leigh and James D'Arcy as Anthony Perkins.","67","975645"
"10471","Director Kay Cannon‘s perspective is the film’s biggest asset, as it freshens up the traditional formula’s inevitable focus on love, consent, and orientation in ways that maintain the sub-genre’s trademark raunch.","67","2531344"
"10472","The biggest problem with Crystal Skull is one that's lately plagued Spielberg in otherwise excellent films like ""Munich"" and ""War Of The Worlds"": He fails to stick the landing. And for an entertainment with nothing much on its mind, that hurts.","67","367882"
"10473","It is, however, a very satisfying film, and surely the first in a long franchise (it does, after all, bear the subtitle The Vampire Chronicles).","67","110148"
"10474","While certainly imperfect, there is something to admire about the film’s attempt to present the tangled logistics of a single military operation, where it seems everyone wants success but none of the responsibility of the tough decision making involved.","67","2057392"
"10475","Kon-Tiki directors Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg are at the helm this time around, proving capable captains even if the script they’re working from isn’t always seaworthy.","67","1790809"
"10476","Improves on the original in at least one key way: Its lead characters appear to have souls.","67","472399"
"10477","Could have used a lot more grit. Without it, we're left with a crime movie fantasia that slips all too easily into the ether.","67","1152836"
"10478","Strictly texture, a romp over the surfaces of Andy Kaufman's life with not much insight into its core.","67","125664"
"10479","In the end, the movie says that the President's private life matters, all right -- that Shepherd should get the girl and reestablish his leadership by giving in to the noble liberal he always was inside. Even for a modern Capra fable, that's a bit much to swallow.","67","112346"
"10480","While never as dynamically involving as Christopher Nolan's ""Inception,"" for which longtime Nolan director of photography Pfister justifiably won an Oscar, Transcendence still grapples with provocative existential concepts in similarly thoughtful terms.","67","2209764"
"10481","It’s a hard film to shake, and there’s an awful lot to be said for that.","67","838221"

"10483","Consistently entertaining.","67","108399"
"10484","Columbus never quite captures the depth, the rich complexities of Rowling's novels. She's written four Harry Potter books for kids that adults swoon for, too. Columbus has made two Harry Potter movies for kids … and we'll leave it at that. That isn't bad. But I suspect there's something better just around the bend.","67","295297"
"10485","My Friend Dahmer becomes one of the year’s most chilling true-life dramas.","67","2291540"
"10486","The ludicrous action-flick plot slows to a crawl whenever Kendrick and Rockwell aren’t on screen.","67","2091935"
"10487","Everyone knows that the villains are usually the most interesting characters in any movie. So the makers of Despicable Me were wise to cut to the chase and make the megalomaniacal Gru (voiced by Carell) the central character in this animated film.","67","1323594"
"10488","For the most part, Spielberg appears content to allow the story (admittedly, a tad bit long) to do the talking, though he goes badly off-track in the sappy ending reminiscent of a Fifties sitcom’s notions of hierarchy within the American family. Given the Spielberg film canon, it was inevitable. The guy just can’t help himself.","67","3682448"
"10489","For all her chops as a dramatic actor, she's our new Judy Holliday and Goldie Hawn, only even sharper.","67","852713"
"10490","Director John Maybury has a feel for shock rhythms, and he's skillful at keeping you guessing, but after a while you want your questions to cohere into compelling answers, and in The Jacket they don't, quite.","67","366627"
"10491","It makes for a compelling viewing experience, thanks to Villeneuve’s formal chops and the uniformly strong performances.","67","1392214"
"10492","The Ides Of March goes down easily, with a sophisticated bustle and a strong third act twist to test the hero's mettle. But it all feels a bit inconsequential - perhaps by design.","67","1124035"
"10493","He's (Affleck) vaguely likable, but he's outshone by his co-stars and never particularly believable in his role.","67","184858"
"10494","At times, the movie resembled nothing so much as Kabuki with Cosmos.","67","1000774"
"10495","It's the strangest comic-book superhero movie you're likely to see this year. For anyone looking for something totally different in this most overworked of Hollywood genres, this is it.","67","434409"
"10496","The loner has to learn to put someone else first. It’s both as manipulative and hokey as that sounds, but occasionally it works well enough that you might find yourself getting choked up against your better judgment.","67","3315342"
"10497","Skip it, and you'll be depriving yourself of one of the summer's most satisfyingly stupid pleasures.","67","2334879"
"10498","The fact that the blatantly thumbtacked-on happy ending plays as unvarnished fairy tale adds a definite bittersweet tang of irony.","67","199725"
"10499","Red Eye's no classic, but with its smart, twisty little script and those two killer performances, it is a helluva lot of fun.","67","421239"
"10500","It's got some great action sequences and is peppered with genuinely dazzling images. It's also subtly infused with Mann's favored themes of men-at-work and the high price of loyalty to duty. But it hasn't got sufficient meat to warrant its draggy length.","67","430357"
"10501","One of those late-summer releases that’s just good enough to make you wish it were better, The Spy Who Dumped Me aims to please every step of the way, but it never earns the nearly two-hour running time.","67","6663582"
"10502","It's more consistently amusing and inspired than an adaptation of an '80s TV show has any right to be.","67","1232829"
"10503","What is not debatable, however, is that Cruise is an actor of limited emotional resources, one who lacks the presence required for the film’s protagonist, a character intended to inhabit more than one dimension.","67","325710"
"10504","Easily the smartest, snarkiest, and most honest depiction of that tweenage wasteland known as the ""middle school years"" that this former wimpy freak and geek has come across since having survived the daily derision afforded those of us who chose to spend our lunch periods perusing J.R.R. Tolkien, playing Dungeons & Dragons, or just hiding out in the boys' room.","67","1196141"
"10505","The Front Runner spends too much time involved in the glare of the situation rather than examining its intricacies or characters. Like many of Reitman’s films, particularly Men, Women & Children, The Front Runner is interested in the subject of privacy as mitigated by the TMI era. The character of Gary Hart, unfortunately, becomes only a means to this end.","67","7074886"
"10506","Enjoys the weird distinction of being one of the year's funniest comedies and one of the best zombie movies ever made.","67","365748"
"10507","Its violence is right out of a ""Road Runner"" cartoon and, despite the R-rating, relatively benign; its special effects and camera movements are often quite imaginative; and, at less than 90 minutes, it's mercifully short. [19 Feb 1993]","67","106308"
"10508","Something is going on all the time, even if that something is oftentimes clumsy, nonsensical, or flat. But the sheer whoosh of the story line keeps you watching anyway.","67","473075"
"10509","Definitely still beating a dead dinosaur here, but the film is leaner, more exciting and superior in every way to the last outing.","67","163025"
"10510","Here's a movie that's jam-packed with bizarre sci-fi concepts, political allegory, a fascinating international cast and some truly over the top set pieces. But for just about everything maniacally cool in the movie, there's a flaw, sometimes a near-fatal one.","67","1706620"
"10511","Pablo Larraín's Jackie is an elegy to two slandered traits: self-consciousness and superficiality.","67","1619029"
"10512","Unquestionably stands above the market standard for middlebrow comedies, but it repeatedly approaches greatness and stands down, beholden to forces quite possibly beyond the directors' control.","67","1570728"
"10513","Even though Macaulay Culkin's alternately muggy and inexpressive lead performance hasn't worn well, the supporting turns by Catherine O'Hara and John Candy are especially crackerjack, as is John Williams' buoyantly cartoony score.","67","99785"
"10514","McDormand is a bit too spartan and sealed off in the role. Her steeliness doesn’t have enough emotional levels.","67","5027774"
"10515","Because we know almost from the get-go that things will turn out bad-to-bittersweet for them, the movie is like one long autopsy of what went wrong, starting with Day No. 488.","67","1022603"
"10516","While a splendidly acted and worthily grown-up movie, too often has the feel of a potboiling soap opera, with twists and turns that range from the grimly ironic to the absurdly sensational.","67","315733"
"10517","The film constantly plays against expectations. Reitman’s skilled direction of the superb cast allows the ridiculous to become poetic, the artificial to unfold naturally, the absurd to achieve a deep romantic resonance.","67","1967545"
"10518","Lost Highway has scattered moments of Lynch's poetry, but the film's ultimate shock is that it isn't shocking at all.","67","116922"
"10519","This a film where men on both sides of the line are seasoned and efficient. Men after Mamet's own heart.","67","360009"
"10520","Moves like a bat out of hell from frame one, though if you’re looking for any kind of emotion you might be barking up the wrong tree.","67","2709768"
"10521","Dragon Emperor succeeds largely through sheer excess: It's doubtful that any idea was thrown out for being too implausible.","67","859163"
"10522","Solid, workmanlike stuff, and enough to keep the legions of X-philes sated until next September. And since I realize some of you are dying to know, no, Mulder's butt remains, as always, fully clothed.","67","120902"
"10523","Nearly everything in The Big Lebowski is a put-on, but all that leaves you with is the Coens' bizarrely over-deliberate, almost Teutonic form of rib nudging.","67","118715"
"10524","Makes the case that Fischer's chess prowess and his mental illness were inextricable. The chess fed the paranoia which supported the chess which drove Fischer deeper into madness, and so on.","67","1596345"
"10525","The standout in Win Win is Alex Shaffer, a former New Jersey state champion cast as Kyle.","67","1606392"
"10526","It does a nice job of balancing stillness and action, but it hits weakly when it hits at all and falls short of the small grandness to which it aspires.","67","1440728"
"10527","Writer-director Martin McDonagh's followup to his more cohesive ""In Bruges"" is a middle finger to cliches ""Pulp Fiction"" wrought, while garishly reveling in the same hyper-ironic, pop referenced ultraviolence it lampoons.","67","1931533"
"10528","The film, though sleek and easy to sit through, replaces genuine dramatic involvement with a superficial, rock & roll empathy-it's as though we were watching Cruise's character and playing air guitar to his emotions. There are plenty of soulless movies around. What's special about Days of Thunder is that it works overtime trying to convince you it's not one of them.","67","99371"
"10529","""Interview With the Vampire"" it's not, but marginally thrilling nonetheless, and besides, any film that features a house party in which the ceiling-mounted fire extinguishers expel freshets of crimson goo in place of H2O gets my vote.","67","120611"
"10530","Proyas does a jaw-dropping job, particularly in the opening scenes, of depicting Chicago in the year 2035.","67","343818"
"10531","At its best, it’s a moody, scary, post-Peckinpah meditation on masculinity — and an all too rare opportunity to see Mr. Wright fronting a feature.","67","5057140"
"10532","Somewhere in the middle of After The Wedding it becomes clear as day: Michelle Williams is one of a kind. Not that we didn’t know this already. Still, it’s nice to be reminded.","67","7985692"
"10533","You won’t be upset you saw it, you’ll have some fun, you’ll see Wolvie beat the living hell out of a helicopter. These are good things, and it’s why studios are provided huge budgets to play with in the first place.","67","458525"
"10534","Despite the don't-look-down Olympian settings, Cliffhanger's spirit is brutal and earthbound.","67","106582"
"10535","It's less of a showcase for Bateman's ability to direct comedic storytelling than simply to make people laugh, which makes Bad Words a sufficiently vulgar playground.","67","2170299"
"10536","Indeed, Goyer has penned many scripts superior to this one (he co-wrote cult gem Dark City), but he does make sure you're never far away from a big ""Boo!""","67","1139668"
"10537","Banter and bullets is the action-movie MO, and the duo at the center of it hardly seem to have to stretch to spread their bickering charm on thick. By the shock-and-awe climax, though — when everything but the goatee pretty much goes up in flames — other things have worn thin.","67","1502397"
"10538","While this flinty and forever relevant medieval drama perfectly embodies the struggles of its heroines, it also shares their fatal inability to reconcile personal strife with political strategy.","67","2328900"
"10539","Paramount prefers to think of Star Trek: Generations as the first of a new film series, rather than the seventh act of the old, but prior knowledge of the saga definitely is a necessity. It's a movie filled with punchlines that depend on the audience knowing the set-ups. [18 Nov. 1994, p.3]","67","111280"
"10540","Beneath its heavy-breathing fripperies, though, Basic Instinct is mechanical and routine, a muddle of Hitchcockian red herrings and standard cop-thriller ballistics.","67","103772"
"10541","Daniel Radcliffe cleans up nicely as Igor, the man behind the madman who makes the monster in this, the 60th (thereabouts) film to adapt or riff on Mary Shelley’s prescient 1818 sci-fi/horror novel. Happily, director Paul McGuigan, working from a script by Max Landis, takes the story in some new directions by choosing to retell the tale from the perspective of the famed hunchback.","67","1976009"
"10542","Somewhere in that chirpy half-pint frame dwell some meaty comic chops. Goldie Hawn may have found her successor.","67","250494"
"10543","When Shults soars under this structure, he composes some brilliant moments. When he falters, it seems like the movie doesn’t know where to go or when to end (if it even wants to).","67","8652728"
"10544","There are times when even its subtleties seem predictable, when it questions dramatic conventions that indie films have already questioned, like the temperament of movie-parents whose children fear coming out of the closet. Yet the film has an abiding sweetness that's ultimately irresistible.","67","1233334"
"10545","A strangely passive film, dutifully ladling out its bits of filmic wizardry and expanding Lewis Carroll’s fantastical mythos in a promising new direction without any palpable sense of glee or verve.","67","1014759"
"10546","An upper-tier addition to a long running horror franchise that arguably deserves better than a January release.","67","3612126"
"10547","As pleasantly plastic as its retro-chic sets.","67","124298"
"10548","In a film like this, timing is everything, and everyone from the stunt coordinators to the crew-at-large seems to have gotten it right the first time.","67","111257"
"10549","The casting is solid, with an even more pumped-up Jordan once again anchoring the movie as the conflicted young boxer in the title. But it’s the underdeveloped villains of the piece who ultimately prove more intriguing, despite their one-dimensionality.","67","6343314"
"10550","It’s most definitely not for the squeamish nor the easily offended -- the death scenes in Final Destination 2, of which there are many, are immensely bloody and imaginative affairs, full of exploding limbs, squashed bodies, and graphic, gory ultra-violence.","67","309593"
"10551","This tame but fitfully funny goof on suspense cinema at least assembles an agreeable guest list.... As with any real game night, the company is more important than the game.","67","2704998"
"10552","Haynes fails to impart Wonderstruck with the sort of zip that gives young persons’ capers like these the pacing they require.","67","5208216"
"10553","The movie, starring Rogen as a mall cop with anger management issues, is essentially a goony romp flecked with disturbing eruptions of violence.","67","1197628"
"10554","What is notable, though, is the amount of compassion invested in the film by Cameron and co-screenwriter William Wisher. There's a fairly well-drawn moral message in T2 that was more or less absent in the first film.","67","103064"
"10555","Lonergan's dialogue can sweep you up in a whoosh of personality and ideas, but it's hard to see what, apart from ego, convinced him that this story was so epic.","67","466893"
"10556","It's such an accomplished, beguiling film in its details that you almost don't notice that the story is scattershot, arbitrary, and thin -- almost.","67","165854"
"10557","No matter how good-natured, The Holiday ends up a glutted farce.","67","457939"
"10558","Sweet and wise and often laugh-out-loud funny (just like Grogan's book), Marley & Me isn't just for dog people; it's just not for Cruella De Vil.","67","822832"
"10559","Downsizing is rife with witty visual touches and inspired comic premises but never quite comes together as fully successful whole.","67","1389072"
"10560","No matter how much The Theory of Everything showcases the incredible process through which Hawking maintains a connection to the rest of the world, it falls short of burrowing inside his head.","67","2980516"
"10561","Hall, one of our least appreciated great actors, is mesmerizing as Sydney.","67","119256"
"10562","An engaging spectacle of energy and special effects built around a doomy mood and an ensemble cast vigorously pursuing a story line that isn't nearly as snazzy as the dressing.","67","290334"
"10563","The beats of Fighting With My Family are comfortingly familiar, and the soap opera pomp of the wrestling world is eye-popping to both fans and neophytes alike, but it’s Pugh that is always fresh, surprising, and wily. The film might not hit hard, but Pugh never stops doing just that.","67","6513120"
"10564","The story is so sure-fire that it surmounts these obstacles to be passable entertainment, getting frequent infusions of excitement from the performances of Charlie Sheen, who is likably ironic and deadpan as Aramis; Kiefer Sutherland, who is splendidly charismatic and appealing as the world-weary Athos; and Oliver Platt, who confidently steals the movie as the comic Porthos. [12 Nov 1993]","67","108333"
"10565","It's a thriller, and a large one, and it's got a couple of terrific performers in the center.","67","373926"
"10566","Sets, music, and imagery are rigorously controlled and undeniably stunning, but after a while flaws creep into the plot's double helix.","67","119177"
"10567","An epic aestheticization of World War II, a movie at once bold and baffling, immediate and abstract.","67","120863"
"10568","It's a brisk, though laugh-imbalanced, B-comedy with a hard R.","67","1622547"
"10569","If Get Out isn’t half as scary as the ideas that inspired it, Jordan Peele’s directorial debut is almost certain to be the boldest — and most important — studio genre release of the year. What it lacks in fear, it nearly makes up for in fearlessness.","67","5052448"
"10570","While Midsommar never bores or truly overstays its welcome, its languor wobbles into meandering tonal shifts, with unlikely intrusions of absurdist humor.","67","8772262"
"10571","The movie is propulsive and, if you aren’t nauseated by the ethics, quite engaging.","67","1355644"
"10572","The film in the end seems more of an expertly orchestrated blood bath than a full-scale tragedy.","67","1365050"
"10573","What's more, they toss a few original twists into a familiar generic set-up and thereby create a thoroughly entertaining and stylish thriller.","67","115736"
"10574","A cute premise that, upon closer inspection, rings falser rather than truer. It's pretty good, but not nearly as good as Brooks gets.","67","119822"
"10575","It’s Complicated is the sort of “mature” character piece the French do regularly and better (and without the need for quotation marks around “mature”), but the cast at least helps relieve some of the tidiness that belies the title.","67","1230414"
"10576","Roeg's points about the contrasts between noble savages and civilized effetes don't stand up terribly well over time.","67","67959"
"10577","Pure, unadulterated teen exploitation filmmaking at its best -- a heady, rocketing blast of fast cars, loud hip-hop, and a script so cheesy it might as well have “Made in Wisconsin” stamped on it.","67","232500"
"10578","Part 1 of Harry Potter's long goodbye is technically impressive as usual, especially an animated shadow play explaining the whole Deathly Hallows myth.","67","926084"
"10579","In a movie that likens passing legislation to pulling off a massive heist, eventually departing from reality altogether in a series of late-game twists so intricate they would make Danny Ocean blush, the sheer velocity of Chastain’s performance holds it all together.","67","4540710"
"10580","Galifianakis' magnetic performance suggests murky psychological depths the film doesn't have the substance to plumb.","67","804497"
"10581","A total guilty pleasure.","67","134847"
"10582","All that director Kenneth Branagh must do with Thor is not mess it up, and he succeeds. But that isn't enough. The results aren't as exhilarating as the first ""Iron Man,"" but Downey can't play every superhero.","67","800369"
"10583","The filmmakers may be just as clueless as Buddy when it comes to Mavis, who resembles nothing so much as a snooty stalker.","67","1625346"
"10584","The leads’ prolonged, puffed-feathers sparring is entertaining while it lasts, but the sensation of something sizable is only fleeting.","67","2582802"
"10585","There is much to look at--it's like spending two hours in Michael Jackson's Undead Neverland--but not a lot at stake.","67","120616"
"10586","In a film marketplace where even the best superhero movies tend to do a lot of the same stuff, I really admire Will Smith and bad-boy director Peter Berg for trying something different.","67","448157"
"10587","It's a carefully manicured, almost genteel piece of moviemaking. The film is paradoxically both rousing and lulling.","67","1454029"
"10588","Unlike the first ''Back to the Future,'' though, the sequel doesn't stay fresh and surprising all the way through. After a few good scenes, the plot gets too tricky, and the filmmakers keep walloping us with one chase scene after another. [4 Dec. 1989, p.10]","67","96874"
"10589","Perhaps the discrete delegation of the thrills to the 1966 story and the moral quandaries to the 1997 story is what prevents The Debt from congealing as well as it might have. Life is rarely that neat.","67","1226753"
"10590","It’s fine and funny and sweet and lush and some of the songs are infectious, but I still don’t completely understand why it exists — and why they couldn’t do more with it.","67","2771200"
"10591","At Lonergan's best, he turns the sounds of Patrick's home into its own claustrophobic, percussive sympathy.","67","4034228"
"10592","The Beguiled is a slow-burn tale of repressed sexuality and duplicitous doings. Its final twist, though, steals it from the realm of male-gaze fantasies into sheer nightmare territory.","67","5592248"
"10593","It's unusually provocative and challenging for a Hollywood movie and, surprisingly, allows the audience to piece things together without too much external direction.","67","120382"
"10594","As a romantic comedy, The Back-up Plan is friendly but also a bit drab.","67","1212436"
"10595","Denying Scorsese's raw talent and experience as a filmmaker would be insanity – although the decision to digitally de-age his actors proves the technology is still spotty, and works best in long shots. But that the only major film made in America this year about unions dredges up Hoffa again, and the Italian American community is yet again made synonymous with organized crime, seems tone deaf and self-indulgent.","67","1302006"
"10596","Alien is the most artful entry in the drool-beast series. It gets serious points for cinematography, editing and design. But it hardly generates the requisite shocks its predecessors have so skillfully delivered. [22 May 1992, p.8]","67","103644"
"10597","Hudsucker Proxy works more like a fairy tale in which all implausibilities are acceptable and none of it has to play by real-world rules. But it's a fairy tale without any lessons, a satire without any targets.","67","110074"
"10598","Schrader’s chief influence here, as in many of his other films, is the great French director Robert Bresson, especially his “Diary of a Country Priest.” But Bresson’s spare stylistics achieved a sublimity while Schrader’s, though intermittently powerful, too often feel schematic.","67","6053438"
"10599","Meticulous and abstruse, Shane Carruth’s Upstream Color is an idiosyncratic film that invites explication but defies total understanding.","67","2084989"
"10600","It’s a narratively audacious, ultra-stylish, and at times queasily violent film that’s likely to polarize audiences even as they find themselves unable to tear their eyes from the screen.","67","4550098"
"10601","Carrey isn't afraid to go happily psycho, like Peter Sellers or Eminem on his funniest tracks, and that's his edge.","67","315327"
"10602","Bouncy animation and catchy songs keep the film from tasting too much like spinach.","67","298388"
"10603","In trying to tell the whole of this nearly implausible tale, the film can’t figure out whether it’s more invested in young Saroo’s harrowing journey or older Saroo’s feeling of displacement.","67","3741834"
"10604","The film looks terrific, all Vermeer-style light/dark interplay and sleek design. And Portman is fantastic as the tempestuous Anne.","67","467200"
"10605","Goes down easy enough at first. But even at a svelte 81 minutes, this meal drags on too long.","67","844471"
"10606","Marvelous not in its evocation of horror but in the way it slowly chips away at the mundanities of day-to-day urban living.","67","164181"
"10607","The political angle is gratuitous, even foolish, and certainly a distraction from the movie's visual strengths.","67","1462758"
"10608","It’s muddy, bloody, and studded with amputated limbs, yet still rather generic-feeling; it lacks the visceral impact of Joe Wright’s version of Western Front atrocities in ""Atonement.""","67","1441953"
"10609","Fresh and stale in equal measure, Coco represents the best of what Pixar can be, and the worst of what they’ve become.","67","2380307"
"10610","If The Founder comes up short of providing a satisfactory dramatization of its main storyline, at least it peels back the veil with sufficient intrigue. Yet it still leaves the sour impression that Kroc got the last laugh. Even in this less-than-flattering portrait, he remains its brightest star.","67","4276820"
"10611","If it’s all more than a bit silly, not to mention derivative, Krull manages to cast a fantastical spell courtesy of Peter Yates’ direction.","67","85811"
"10612","In trying to make Kalmen's story unique, the film inadvertently exposes him as the most typical sufferer of midlife crises you could imagine.","67","1294213"
"10613","Connelly, in particular, soars as the nail-biting mother trying desperately to put on a brave face and keep her family together, while Ruffalo and Phoenix, two of Hollywood’s best brooders, are excellent as wounded young fathers.","67","831884"
"10614","The story is patently implausible and unnecessarily confusing, and it works to a moral dilemma for its hero -- and a trick ending for the audience -- that resolves the action with so little satisfaction that you wish they hadn't bothered.","67","452623"
"10615","Anyone looking for a full-bodied account of the woman, her deeds, and her place in history shouldn't be encouraged to linger too long with The Iron Lady.","67","1007029"
"10616","Full of small, weird moments.","67","340163"
"10617","A solid contemporary crime drama.","67","421073"
"10618","Melissa Leo has some standout scenes as the secretary of defense, who gets pretty well beaten up for defying her captors, but others, such as Angela Bassett and Morgan Freeman, have little to do but bite their lips and look tense from the confines of their command posts.","67","2302755"
"10619","Fails to completely engage the viewer at the basic level of story.","67","120834"
"10620","Has its lewd funniness, though not often enough to make it worthy of not only ""Bad Santa"" but, more to the point, ""School of Rock.""","67","1284575"
"10621","It’s brassy, breezy and gut-bustingly fun; unfortunately, it’s at the expense of the film’s drama and pathos.","67","3501632"
"10622","It is certainly the best button-pushing movie of the year.","67","929632"
"10623","The music is lively, loud, often powerful, sometimes raunchy, yet full of unexpected subtleties and nuances. The staging is frenetic but as perfect as the machines of the art can produce. This is first class music video.","67","87957"
"10624","For all his directorial shortcomings, Berg has a knack for capturing men at work; his depiction of special-ops maneuvering—of silently casing the enemy base, of planning the attack—is as compelling as the chaotic violence he orchestrates later.","67","1091191"
"10625","Of all the roles where the star has played a character transformed from ordinary to goofy (""The Mask,"" ""Me, Myself & Irene,"" ""Liar Liar""), this is the one where he seems the most human, achieving that elusive quality in a Carrey film: tolerability.","67","1068680"
"10626","Without the music, the movie might have been painful, but the songs, Auto-Tuned and processed as they are, generate a hooky bliss. They're the chewy center of this ultra-synthetic hard candy.","67","1981677"
"10627","Brand can seem simultaneously randy and strung-out and is often very funny. Hill is surprisingly touching.","67","1226229"
"10628","Unlike any other film released this past year, be it from the aspect of its storylines, of which there are many, or its emotional clarity, which is, quite frankly, brutal.","67","175880"
"10629","Horror fans should still seek the film out for Dren -- one of the most striking abominations to hit the big screen in a while.","67","1017460"
"10630","Rabid is a suitable entry into the science-fiction/horror genre that occasionally slants towards the promise of offering something more. And while the film’s science-fiction/horror elements don’t disappoint, the promise of something more doesn’t quite pull through.","67","5628902"
"10631","Only when you look closer do you realize that While You Were Sleeping exhibits precious few genuine feelings. It's a movie cranked out by machine, about supposedly delightfully idiosyncratic characters who only do what they do because the highly structured plot requires it.","67","114924"
"10632","Fails to recapture the elemental magic of Star Wars, and that, ironically, is because it represents the coarse culmination of the original film's adrenaline aesthetic.","67","120915"
"10633","The senseless violence of a Jean-Claude Van Dammer, no point to that, but this, this has purpose. This is an ass-kicking a girl can get into. So why do I feel like crying mea culpa?","67","278435"
"10634","Event Horizon could have used a decent script, but the director, Paul Anderson, is a stylist to watch.","67","119081"
"10635","This hip send-up of the superhero lifestyle has a bunch of great comic bits from a group of great, eccentric talents, but not enough bourgeois discipline to see the story through.","67","132347"
"10636","Really, the whole series would be unthinkable without the films of George Romero. In that respect, Anderson has taken another page from the Corman playbook for his superior B-movie: If you're going to steal, at least steal well.","67","1220634"
"10637","In Sidney Lumet's ""Dog Day Afternoon,"" which only looks better with the years, New York was as much a character in that film as its people. It was a movie that took its cue from the energy of the city. The Inside Man takes its cue mostly from other movies.","67","454848"
"10638","Withnail And I works as a comedy, but it's a comedy of desperation, and the ever-present specter of failure, overdose, and addiction haunting its leads lends it an aura of lyrical sadness.","67","94336"
"10639","It feels longer than 90 minute because, despite changing locations frequently enough, Ilya Naishuller‘s debut feature never really has a strong sense of structure nor escalation to make it as truly kinetic as it wants. Yet, at least to some degree, the right spirit is there to lift it through some of the deadening stretches.","67","3072482"
"10640","The movie is admirable in its ambitions; in its execution, less so. The difficulty in making an “intimate” epic is that the characters have to fill out the frame in ways that are both highly individualized and symbolic. They have to be both lifelike and larger-than-life. In Mudbound, this combination works only fitfully.","67","2396589"
"10641","A breezy, dumb and lightweight film that has the benefit of not trying terribly hard to be about much of anything and succeeding (bravo?).","67","480255"
"10642","Is it style over substance? Absolutely. But as with ""Ocean's Eleven,"" style wins -- only just barely this time around.","67","349903"
"10643","A credible action spectacular.","67","146675"
"10644","Henson's characters maintained an essential innocence while sending up the very idea of entertainment. They put on a show with quotation marks around it, but the irony never felt cynical. When it isn't getting bogged down in unearned sentiment, The Muppets gets that right.","67","1204342"
"10645","Because there’s some genuinely great ideas in the film, and some terrific character work, but it’s given such uneven attention, alternately languished upon and glossed over, that the portrait Burger creates feels complete without, well, making us feel a whole lot else.","67","1840309"
"10646","Younger viewers who've cut their teeth on the instant horrors of modern ""torture porn"" may find The Stranger's pace and psychological upsets more slow-going than they might like. Yet a film like this may be just the bracing corrective the modern horror film needs.","67","482606"
"10647","Wholesome, warm and energetic -- if predictable.","67","243585"
"10648","While the account of Walden's heroics doesn't necessarily move from legend to fact, it does push the bounds of truth and raise interesting questions about the function of truth for the survivors of war.","67","115956"
"10649","While it loses the charm of Romero’s low-budget clunkiness, it is in all other regards superior. Unfortunately, it’s not better than “28 Days Later...,” which is close enough to count as an unofficial remake.","67","455407"
"10650","Rolling Thunder is a bloody, nasty, complicated action movie for a bloody, nasty, complicated moment in American history.","67","76637"
"10651","In his directorial debut, Matt Spicer gets right what so many other films commenting on today’s technology obsession fail to capture: the aesthetic appeal of the technology.","67","5962210"
"10652","It has warmth, it has flashes of insight, it even has moments of wit, all it really lacks is edge — which it lacks in large, whopping, huge amounts.","67","3062976"
"10653","Doesn't have much new to offer in either style or substance. It's got the same glossy-gritty urban warfare sheen as ""Black Hawk Down"" and every other Third-World geopolitical action thriller of the last few years.","67","758774"
"10654","Easy A has some agreeable fast banter, but it's so self-consciously stylized that it wears you out.","67","1282140"
"10655","No one else in Inglourious Basterds comes close to Landa for sheer charisma.","67","361748"
"10656","Offers nothing new. It's actually one of Polanski's more conventional films and, ultimately, it's hard to recommend it with a clear conscience.","67","253474"
"10657","There’s enough potential with the balloon’s feats to justify an entire feature-length experience set within its basket, but The Aeronauts constantly interrupts the journey to shoehorn random tangents on the ground, and busies up the drama with underdeveloped side characters.","67","6141246"
"10658","Instead of a thrilling climax, he chooses to let the story evaporate into the Amazon fog. Yet this odd film left a chill in my bones that I'll be thinking about all summer.","67","1212428"
"10659","It's a death-wish revenge thriller posing as a lavishly pastoral historical epic.","67","187393"
"10660","Bacon's mature performance serves a story that's considerably less sophisticated than he is, making The Woodsman less ""brave"" and more a slightly better-made movie of the week.","67","361127"
"10661","It’s 85 minutes of grim abyss-gazing with no hope of salvation. If Silverman’s going to bare her soul this nakedly, she deserves a better film to do it in.","67","3640682"
"10662","Part character study, part redemptive drama, and all cheesy heart, it's Boston-baked melodrama, a little too gooey at times, but still pretty delicious.","67","119217"
"10663","Scott, working from a script by William Monahan, is so busy balancing our sympathies, making sure no one gets offended, that he has made a pageant of war that would have gotten a thumbs-up from Eleanor Roosevelt.","67","320661"
"10664","It’s biopic syndrome, this impulse to condense events to hit the high notes, to provide fans with recognizable stories, to essentially act as a greatest hits album, and it sinks the second half of an otherwise compelling, funny and extremely entertaining film with a beat all its own.","67","1398426"
"10665","It's more fun than a poke in the heart with a sharp stick.","67","450405"
"10666","Green has made a slavish, sharply executed bit of fan service elevated by Jamie Lee Curtis’ transformation into a badass grandmother back to finish the job.","67","1502407"
"10667","""The only thing that matters is the ending,"" says Rainey toward the end of the movie. He's talking about the writers' craft. Koepp, despite the best efforts of his cast, sends this comment soaring into the ether of irony.","67","363988"
"10668","Simply put, Burton's film lacks the social and political gravitas of the original, a film that was wholly of its time.","67","133152"
"10669","A blast to watch if for nothing more than the performances. They hit the proverbial jackpot.","67","318374"
"10670","The Boss, without quite reaching the heights of McCarthy’s work with Paul Feig, establishes its star as sort of a comic auteur — which is not the same as repeating herself.","67","2702724"
"10671","Mann's film is beautiful to watch. Cinematogrpaher Emmanuel Lubezki employs a washed-out, harshly lit style that makes everything look vaguely menacing and hyper-real, which is complemented by Lisa Gerrard and Pieter Bourke's Africanized score.","67","248667"
"10672","It is overlong, and familiar, and never quite hits top gear -- it's never especially bad, but neither is it especially excellent, beyond the visual wow factor. But there's still a lot to admire in the film, not least that it's engaging from the first moment to the last.","67","1483013"
"10673","Much of the material gets rehashed with slight variations...and many of the space battles have a redundant quality.","67","3896198"
"10674","A stunningly impassioned and articulate study of a writer's life and the censorial demons that can strangle that voice.","67","180073"
"10675","It’s not an altogether convincing portrait, but it is an entertaining, even moving one, and the forcefulness of Bullock's presence goes a long way in pulling the film back from the brink of cuddliness.","67","878804"
"10676","Though Villeneuve magnifies the pervasive dread surrounding the modern drug war, he's better at conveying the thrill of creeping through that battlefield than the complex set of interests sustaining it.","67","3397884"
"10677","Washington is always superb when playing characters with a surface calm, but a boiling-over interior. Here, as the protagonist, he steers a vivid course through a seamy world.","67","455944"
"10678","While the story attempts the moves that a Pixar film typically makes—nonverbal storytelling, death, a bittersweet ending—most of The Good Dinosaur’s punches land soft, made worse by the disconnect that exists between the overly cartoonish style of the characters and the photorealistic landscapes.","67","1979388"
"10679","Putting a human face on a public tragedy that already had a human face, Fruitvale Station plays like an uncomplicated eulogy, with little more to say on its subject than “what a shame this bad thing happened.”","67","2334649"
"10680","It's not just the crack stunt driving that makes Ronin such a welcome throwback; it's also the existential hardness of this thriller's motley band of mercenaries.","67","122690"
"10681","Let it be known that The Way Back – in which Ben Affleck plays a drunk who once walked away from basketball glory and is offered a chance at redemption when his old coach has a heart attack – is possibly the most melancholy sports movie ever made.","67","8544498"
"10682","So much of the movies is the right kind of entertaining, with the right kind of actors playing the right kind of second-tier blockbuster roles, that Bloodshot cannot help but be a cult classic in the making. This is Hollywood escapism at its finest at a time when we need it the most.","67","1634106"
"10683","Unlikely to be either the tea party or Occupy America's first pick for best film of the year, Margin Call is nevertheless a surprisingly adroit effort to A) explain the birth pains of our current financial woes, and B) show what it might have been like, in these first few hours within the confines of an early investment trading firm casualty.","67","1615147"
"10684","No Strings Attached isn't a BAD piece of formulaic product.","67","1411238"
"10685","Easy on the eyes, intermittently amusing and never downright awful.","67","1334512"
"10686","The delivery in Idiocracy is frequently flat, but it's vision is dead-on.","67","387808"
"10687","Visually, the film’s technique is thrilling. There’s hardly a camera setup anywhere that doesn’t look like it could be a frame ripped from a comic book or graphic novel.","67","458481"
"10688","Director Chad Stahelski — Reeves' stunt double for Point Break and The Matrix — aims only for a kinetic revenge yarn with wrinkles drive-in movie critic Joe Bob Briggs might appreciate, like martial arts moves at point blank bullet range; what he'd call gun fu.","67","2911666"
"10689","A handsome work of impressive sweep dotted with fine performances. It offers a few fine moments of wit, fear and emotional intimacy. But it rarely pulses with vital life.","67","159365"
"10690","Less and less a skillfully creepy B-movie and more and more a plea for ecumenical reform.","67","145531"
"10691","""Buster Scruggs” is a singular illustration of what makes the Coen formula so appealing, and a reminder of so many better examples.","67","6412452"
"10692","As Levinson swings wildly for the fences, Assassination Nation yields a modicum of payoff.","67","6205872"
"10693","Surprisingly flabby, with lazy writing and some final-act lurches into unironic rom-com that seem at odds with the bizarro premise.","67","396269"
"10694","You either think it's dementedly wild at heart or a lost highway to nowhere.","67","90756"
"10695","A nutty, awkward, oddly impassioned parable that mashes together so many different genres that calling it “unclassifiable” doesn’t really explain very much.","67","3967856"
"10696","A surprisingly large number of the laughs work, although, understandably, a good number of them also fall flat. You can bet that whenever the story slows down to advance the plot concerning its paper-thin characters, the film takes a noticeable dip.","67","129387"
"10697","This pleasantly rote movie will rouse you.","67","1028576"
"10698","This is just silliness run mildly wild.","67","1045778"
"10699","Though the film is not more than sum of its parts, well, those parts are pretty great. You just wish they belonged to a slightly deeper film.","67","2543164"
"10700","It’s an impressive closing to the cycle, and, frankly, one that arrives not a moment too soon.","67","242653"
"10701","Despite a cool backdrop and a daring idea, the heist itself feels like a third-tier Soderbergh joint, one that’s temporarily bolstered by the same jazzy music and quick cuts that marked the filmmaker’s trilogy, though carried out with considerably less energy.","67","5164214"
"10702","The highbrow intentions of Barney's Version suffer from a constant pile up of dead ends.","67","1423894"
"10703","Bridget Jones’s Baby is not a game-changer, but that’s not what it sets out to be. It’s a goodnatured, accessible, persistently endearing matinee, and sometimes it’s nice to be won over by simple sincerity and commercial likeability.","67","1473832"
"10704","Star Trek VI is just pleasantly diverting, business-as-usual hokum.","67","102975"
"10705","When the fadeout comes, viewers may feel as unsatisfied with the movie as these characters are with their lives.","67","878835"
"10706","Writer/director James Vanderbilt...sticks to Mapes’ version of the truth, and the film serves as a valedictory for Mapes and Rather. Still, the movie never negates the truth’s other strands, while also showing what a human profession journalism is.","67","3859076"
"10707","Parcels out information like a triage medic doling out morphine; every tiny bit is carefully considered and then rationed out as though he were terrified he might exhaust his supply before the closing credits.","67","286106"
"10708","The script lacks the wit of ""Wallace & Gromit.""","67","787474"
"10709","Were women put on earth to be warriors? Demi Moore certainly was. The role of Jordan fits her as snugly as a new layer of muscle.","67","119173"
"10710","Christopher Plummer is delightful as this movie’s master magician and impresario of the rickety Imaginarium.","67","1054606"
"10711","Taken together, the film is kaleidoscopic, sober, and also a bit glib. 22 July is exceptionally choreographed and tough to sit through, but it also leaves an uneasy, bitter aftertaste knowing that the movie is probably exactly the kind of continued attention a deranged narcissist like Breivik would have wanted.","67","7280898"
"10712","Del Toro lays on the operatic head-trip gore, but his heavy-handed embrace of the ''Blade'' mythology allows Wesley Snipes to give more of a performance than he did in the first film.","67","187738"
"10713","Is Gary Winick atoning for his sins? If “Bride Wars” was an acid spill -- and that’s putting it generously -- then Letters to Juliet is like the safety shower in your high school chemistry class, delivering an unsubtle blast of sanitized sentimentality.","67","892318"
"10714","Jean-Stephane Sauvaire’s film is not so much the story of a fighter as it is a story that wants to fight you.","67","4080956"
"10715","The story is tender and heartbreaking.","67","3385524"
"10716","Trumbo’s writing was so terrific, the film emphasizes, that it outweighed his caustic personality, his unfashionable politics, and the career-threatening dangers of working with him.","67","3203606"
"10717","The best thing this film has going for it are the outstanding performances of Pitt and Lewis as a sort of white trash Romeo and Juliet cum Henry Lee and Becky. Pitt is especially believable, so much so that he eerily captures the sociopathic persona of a real-life killer from a true-crime book: the thin, easy-going veneer that masks an evil sense of an absent conscience.","67","107302"
"10718","Taken as a whole -- and it kills me to write this -- it just doesn't add up to much.","67","399295"
"10719","Shamelessly familiar and profoundly alien in equal measure, The Greatest Showman takes a billion of the world’s oldest story beats and refashions their prefab emotions into something that feels like it’s being projected from another planet.","67","1485796"
"10720","It's gory, it's bleak, it's shamelessly tricky -- and it's also a good deal more fun than it had any right to be.","67","309698"
"10721","What About Bob? is just funny enough to make you wish it had been wilder and less predictable.","67","103241"
"10722","Very surprisingly, Meryl Streep is not wonderful as Schreiber's scheming, incestuously possessive mother. She gobbles up all the scenery but, for whatever reason, she's just not half as chilling a portrait of demented mother love as the original's Angela Lansbury.","67","368008"
"10723","Yes, it's Meet the Parents time again but flipped and filthier, in a good way. Why Him? had me laughing louder, more often than most smutcoms do, a NSFW blusher delivered by a keenly comical cast.","67","4501244"
"10724","An unassuming wisp of a movie, Midnight In Paris finds Woody Allen penning a love letter to the City Of Lights, albeit one whose sentiments could easily fit on a postcard.","67","1605783"
"10725","Flight's pat closing sequences are at odds with the complexities presented earlier on. They travel the conventional route and threaten to vastly simplify this story into one of an addict's redemption. Perhaps it was inevitable that the drama on the ground could never equal the excitement of the action that occupies the movie's beginning sequences.","67","1907668"
"10726","Genndy Tartakovsky returns as director, and the creator of ""Samurai Jack and Dexter’s Laboratory"" has somehow managed to kick up the energy even more for the sequel.","67","2510894"
"10727","Burlesque is a terrible film that will delight nearly everyone who sees it, whether they're 12-year-old Christina Aguilera fans or bad-movie buffs angling for a guilty pleasure.","67","1126591"
"10728","There are moments of pleasure, humor and, yes, terror to be had here all the same.","67","229260"
"10729","It's all a little silly, and silly in a way that's less fun than the original—due in part to an obvious subplot involving a poacher played by a hammy Peter Firth—but its kid-friendly B-movie charm and the peerless Mr. Young make it worthwhile, undemanding entertainment.","67","120751"
"10730","If the film was less than satisfying as a big-screen event, it's still worth renting for Pfeiffer, who valiantly portrays the devastating complexities of grief and guilt.","67","120646"
"10731","The movie at times resembles a screenwriting workshop, with Delpy and Hawke trying to shoehorn every shade of this shifting relationship into a single scene. It doesn't feel genuine; certainly these two would know each other better by now.","67","2209418"
"10732","As the pushback to Gerwig’s force field, Kirke may at times be too mousy for her own (or the film’s) good, but her stillnesses are often a welcome respite in this whirligig.","67","2872462"
"10733","Peterson's film is a huge, loud beast of a film, filled with gunfire, explosions, and not a few tears. It's all grounded, however, in Ford's gritted-teeth performance as President Marshall.","67","118571"
"10734","Much of it is funny and endearing, and its toned-down star, Adam Sandler, is as winning as he's ever been.","67","371246"
"10735","[The Kings of Summer] is a wonderful mix of innocence, laughter and beauty that is enjoyable in the moment, yet it’s almost entirely forgettable. With too many odd asides and complications, what should have been a straightforward journey into self-discovery and the difficulties of growing up is waylaid by unnecessary moments and slightly self-indulgent filmmaking.","67","2179116"
"10736","For all its flaws, or rather for all the magnitude of its one massive flaw, it is more sincere than arch, and more earnest, certainly in its desire to get its makers onto the radar, than glib.","67","5112578"
"10737","Wall to wall blood 'n' guts laced with surprisingly keen social satire, much of it targeting the fatuousness of media culture.","67","120201"
"10738","Despite the best of intentions, an actress who makes her own headlines gets in the way of the big picture.","67","829459"
"10739","Bay, at heart, isn't a fantasist; he's a literal-minded maestro of demolition.","67","418279"
"10740","The movie swings back and forth from awesome to awful so regularly and rapidly that it's like a jai alai match.","67","416449"
"10741","A pretty dreadful affair -- ludicrous as history and a veritable gallery of visual cliches.","67","244000"
"10742","Comes across as more willfully clever than profound, leaving us to applaud the message while pondering why the messenger had to strain so hard to get it across.","67","449467"

"10744","Feast isn't quite demented enough to reach Raimi-an heights, but Gulager uses parts of the monster-movie buffalo even the buffalo didn't know existed.","67","426459"
"10745","It's also a mistake, I think, to have Oliver and Jordana be so emotionally flat. No doubt Ayoade was reaching for a hipper-than-thou vibe here, but their inexpressiveness is more annoying than cool.","67","1440292"
"10746","Never achieves the satisfaction of a real crackerjack con movie.","67","844286"
"10747","Downhill brings its characters to the brink of somewhere exciting but never commits to a full descent.","67","4558376"
"10748","With Brad’s Status, Mike White (best known for writing School Of Rock and creating Enlightened) has chosen an alternate route: Make the movie you want to, but sheepishly apologize for its existence — not via interviews or post-screening Q&As, but within the context of the film itself.","67","5884230"
"10749","It all sort of plays out like ""Law and Order: Spiritual Victims Unit,"" but the movie's stuffed (some might say overstuffed) with wonderfully staged moments and set pieces.","67","360486"
"10750","A vast improvement over the previous two outings, but still and all, it's no ""Star Wars.""","67","121766"
"10751","Like Jim Carrey, Ferrell seems to think that the way to be taken seriously as a dramatic actor is to drain himself of everything that audiences love about him.","67","420223"
"10752","Essentially The Conspirator is a courtroom drama with occasional bulletins from the outside world. It plays out to its predictable end with the doggedness, if not the verve, of a ""Law and Order"" episode.","67","968264"
"10753","Like so many of the works of Eastwood’s long late period, Jewell offers a story without much of an endpoint, with an uplifting coda that feels almost as jarring as the ending of ""American Sniper."" But somewhere within its surprisingly pacey two-plus hours is a compelling group portrait of ordinary oddballs in cruel circumstances; it relays Eastwood’s appreciation for individuals over masses better than any speech ever could.","67","3513548"
"10754","Gilroy has fashioned a character study that has moments that are incredibly well written.... What’s extremely disappointing is that the screenplay’s through line is simply not that interesting.","67","6000478"
"10755","Once the battle is joined in earnest, what began as sharp-edged parody starts to feel more like a cheap imitation, even if it’s still shot through with a few priceless zingers. The tough thing about genre hybrids is that they have to fulfill both genres, and Grabbers only nails one of them.","67","1525366"
"10756","When a filmmaker heavy-handedly imposes his contemporary values on a classic of popular art, it's devilishly hard not to destroy or invalidate the very thing that made it a classic.","67","240510"
"10757","Although the movie's ecological message is dominant, it's not heavy-handed. Rather, the ecological warnings are tossed out with the same joie de vivre the Once-ler displays when tossing marshmallows to the bears.","67","1482459"
"10758","I’m not sure I’ve laughed harder all year than at Gosling in a bathroom stall, accidentally dropping a lit cigarette down his pants leg.","67","3799694"
"10759","Shot in vivid black and white, the movie is like ""Village of the Damned"" directed by Ingmar Bergman, only without Bergman's intensity.","67","1149362"
"10760","Junger has a deft touch with light comedy such as this; he manages to keep the film's convoluted plot spinning without resorting to too much gimmickry or descending to the level of so many teen comedies.","67","147800"
"10761","It's a cautionary tale about the excesses of jingoist paranoia, and the folly of it all is that the more the film descends into somber liberal chest thumping, the less engrossing it becomes.","67","133952"
"10762","It's a good movie, mind you, with great bits in it, but it still falls short of rapture.","67","198781"
"10763","While the film ably thrusts longtime fans of Mignola’s highly stylized artwork and newcomers alike into the world of that ol' debbil Hellboy, the film suffers from both scattershot character development and a serious case of H.P. Lovecraft overdose.","67","167190"
"10764","The result bears so little resemblance to the original that you have to wonder what happened. It seems more a remake of ""How the West Was Won"" than 3:10 to Yuma.","67","381849"
"10765","Promised Land can't help but preach its cause in obvious ways that continually hold back an otherwise well-acted, swiftly paced drama.","67","2091473"
"10766","It IS a film that deflates you too often, despite its efforts to impart a sense of soaring. In the end, where the Wild Things are is in your imagination and in Sendak’s pages, not in this big-hearted but ultimately faint simulation.","67","386117"
"10767","Indeed, the film is altogether too much like Sayuri: trying to overwhelm with surface beauty and unspoken emotion, it never hits deeper than the skin.","67","397535"
"10768","Jurassic World, a goofy and fitfully entertaining summer movie, understands and even winks at its place in the pecking order of blockbuster sequels.","67","369610"
"10769","Much has been made of the film's ending, vis-à-vis whether or not it's a pro- or anti-organized religion commentary of some sort. The Hughes Brothers, for two, say they just wanted to make a kickass piece of contemporary entertainment, and I, for one, believe them.","67","1037705"
"10770","The movie keeps you occupied, but in a processed, unexciting way.","67","109446"
"10771","The Descendants is beautifully shot (by Phedon Papamichael) and compellingly performed, especially by its young stars, and it has moments of startling tenderness. If only it didn't feel phony to its bones.","67","1033575"
"10772","Nichols succeeds in spinning an entertaining yarn, but the cautionary aspects feel fatally undernourished.","67","472062"
"10773","Still, it's worth checking out if only to see Kidman immolate everything else on screen through sheer sexy charisma. Tom who?","67","188453"
"10774","As far as the chase genre goes, there have been worse films (better ones, too).","67","106977"
"10775","Maybe Soderbergh felt as though he already did a straight-ahead version of this story with ""Erin Brockovich"" and therefore decided to revamp the tune in the key of Richard Lester.","67","1130080"
"10776","The final third...is so overblown and anticlimactic that it finally gets you thinking about empty profundity and loose ends.","67","399201"
"10777","DiCaprio, having a blast, makes Candie the equivalent of Waltz's Nazi in ""Inglourious Basterds"": a racist villain who mesmerizes us by elevating his ideology into a puckishly thought-out vision of the world. Yet Django isn't nearly the film that Inglourious was.","67","1853728"
"10778","Strange Days - on and off screen - should be a lesson to filmmakers not to use virulent, touchy subjects for entertainment shortcuts. Bigelow has created a state-of-the-art movie machine, with all the moral and political complexity of an Etch-a-Sketch. [13 Oct 1995, p.10]","67","114558"
"10779","I would rather have seen a documentary about the real women instead of this workmanlike dramatic rendition.","67","1371155"
"10780","The mayhem is presented sparingly enough to be suspenseful, some of the sequences are genuinely terrifying and, compared with Hollywood's last zombie movie, the Robert Rodriguez half of ""Grindhouse,"" it's a masterpiece.","67","463854"
"10781","Syriana falls down at the most basic storytelling level, and this incoherence damages even the good parts.","67","365737"
"10782","While it's being sold as ""an effervescent comedy,"" Happy-Go-Lucky is nothing of the sort. It's rather grim, the laughs are few.","67","1045670"
"10783","A fanciful spiral of mythology, madness, cynicism and salvation.","67","101889"
"10784","So gleefully abandons any semblance of sanity that it's virtually impossible not to enjoy the sheer breadth of nonsensical fun taking place on screen.","67","209163"
"10785","It’s derivative and drowning in stagnant machismo, but stark enough to work.","67","1259528"
"10786","Hollywood has been showing people hanging off of things for over 100 years, and if that’s something you enjoy, Skyscraper is the pinnacle of this trope, forcing The Rock to dangle, hang, and swing at insane heights above the street time and time again. This is the MO of the whole movie, taking things that have worked before and pumping them up to The Rock-sized spectacle; it’s not too original but it provides what it promises.","67","5758778"
"10787","Whatever your perspective, there’s one thing for sure: The Red Turtle is unlike anything else you’ve seen in a while.","67","3666024"
"10788","Still, as a nostalgia trip that knows exactly what die-hard Star Wars fans want and then layers in some memorable new characters, The Force Awakens is exactly what it needs to be: an old-school Saturday afternoon sci-fi matinee writ big.","67","2488496"
"10789","Those moments, as affecting as they are, can't surmount the overworkshopped feel of the whole film.","67","1120985"
"10790","There aren’t thrilling dramatic insights to be found here, but Wright’s showboating is unflaggingly watchable.","67","4555426"
"10791","There's a touch of Hitchcockian flavor to the Arbitrage's cat-and-mouse thrills, yet the film clearly announces that there's now a third gifted Jarecki brother (in addition to Eugene and Andrew) to contend with in the moviemaking business.","67","1764183"
"10792","Segel, scripting himself, injects regular bursts of comic genius into the proceedings.","67","800039"
"10793","The first two-thirds of The Maze Runner are a clever feat of fantasy world building. It's thrilling, twisty, and as mysterious as the mammoth Skinner Box environment the film takes place in. But the promising set-up raises so many puzzle-piece questions that when it's all finally explained in the final reel, you can't help feeling a bit gypped.","67","1790864"
"10794","Don't go in expecting much and you'll have fun. Consider it The Rock's ""Raw Deal.""","67","351977"
"10795","The story has more holes than the bodies do, but the shocks are efficient, and Party of Five's Jennifer Love Hewitt knows how to scream with soul.","67","119345"
"10796","The plot is only semi-comprehensible, but the nearly non-stop musical numbers-brilliant conflations of glam-rock and showtunes-and transgressive sexual energy keep things moving.","67","73629"
"10797","If you find the film's xenophobic undercurrents distasteful, take solace in this: Taken was co-written and directed by the Frenchmen responsible for ""District B13,"" so at least the xenophobia is imported.","67","936501"
"10798","Though it can’t overcome the source material’s problematic themes — namely, Card’s intentionalist morality, which prizes a character’s ideals over their actions — or its all-too-convenient characterizations, the film manages a sustained sense of momentum and tone that is rare for a contemporary, big-budget movie.","67","1731141"
"10799","All of this has its value, but Plummer, in rollicking good form, without a shred of sentimentality, is primed for greatness, and Mills keeps cutting away from him just when things are getting interesting.","67","1532503"
"10800","Eastwood never manages to bring the past to life, even as DiCaprio and company dive gamely into the material.","67","1616195"
"10801","There are hints lately that De Niro is trying to build a fourth, restorative act to his wayward film career, and he brings some real fire, without which Stone would be helpless.","67","1423995"
"10802","It's Teen Witch for the Nineties: dark, brooding, dangerous, and, come to think of it, a lot like high school.","67","115963"
"10803","No doubt some of it is charming enough to induce giggles in its preteen target audience.","67","1001526"
"10804","Miles Ahead is well-intentioned and ambitious, but ultimately uneven, as it cannot redefine the structures its so desperately wants to break down.","67","790770"
"10805","While it's focused on the people -- on men who never had mentors struggling to mentor themselves and each other -- the movie works as a smart B film.","67","417217"
"10806","The future-shock details are witty, the sets and skyscapes spectacular. Besson may not be a good director, exactly, but he's a wizard at retrofitting cliches.","67","119116"
"10807","There is a glee to the filmmaking that is matched by a greater sense of control than I've seen from Smith before, and while I think the film is wildly uneven at times, I think that's also the point.","67","3099498"
"10808","Ultimately, it's the period and character details in Super 8 that provide the grist for its winning formula, rather than its emotional arc and monster jolts.","67","1650062"
"10809","Anastasia has the Disney house style down cold, yet the magic is missing. Perhaps that's because the story's somber emotional hook--Anastasia's thwarted desire for home--is asserted rather than dramatized.","67","118617"
"10810","Director John Lee Hancock and screenwriters Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith spend about a third of the film exploring Travers’ childhood in Australia, and there the film succeeds.","67","2140373"
"10811","A stronger character investment up front would have led to a fuller character study as we watch Cathleen walk through the fire.","67","4513316"
"10812","The problem here is we never get much more than the pretty, the quaint and the comfortingly familiar. There's a place for such stuff in the world, yes, but that doesn't make it art.","67","414387"
"10813","Superior in every way to 1995's ""Die Hard With a Vengeance,"" Live Free or Die Hard's goofy generation-gap gambit pays off decently and proves, again, that nattily dressed terrorists are no match for Willis, the once and future Patron Saint of Bang.","67","337978"
"10814","A violent, sober cautionary tale, strictly middle-of-the-road when it comes to its much-ballyhooed politics and grimly obvious in its telling.","67","120586"
"10815","If anything, The Invention of Lying is too soft for the satirical promise of its premise.","67","1058017"
"10816","Shannon is monstrously good – unpredictable where the other actors are clipped and careful – and he steals the whole picture in two short, shattering scenes. When Shannon exits the film, the air gets sucked out again, and you realize the pretty artifice extends to more than just the Wheelers.","67","959337"
"10817","As Endgame sputters to the finish line, it leaves the impression of witnessing a Marvel Movie Marathon compressed to three hours — and 58 seconds, but trust me, they’re disposable — of unbridled fan service.","67","4154796"
"10818","The movie is surprisingly smart about the politics of the glass ceiling, which keeps Tomlin in a pink-collar supervisor position while every man she trains gets promoted past her. The way Coleman asserts his masculinity with phrases like ""cut the balls off the competition,"" and the way our heroic trio works together to sculpt a worker's paradise—complete with flex-time and day-care facilities—serves as an effective summary of the era's hot-button issues.","67","80319"
"10819","It's a one-note gag, but a superior gag performed with a minimum of cheese and a surplus of laugh-out-loud moments.","67","177789"
"10820","This is a movie that cries out for more than the too-cool-for-school Coppola’s trademark hipster anomie. She may be too much a part of the celebrity-mongering world she portrays to do justice to its injustices.","67","2132285"
"10821","The film is meandering and highly uneven, but Robert Downey Jr. is truly oddball as a venomous drama critic, and watching that ball once again roll through Bill Buckner's legs is torture (for Red Sox fans anyway).","67","425055"
"10822","A mangy-looking mongrel with a lot of familiar markings and a little more on the ball than you'd expect at first glance.","67","452702"
"10823","There’s something genuine and more than a little sad at the core of Levy’s poorly staged, modestly amusing comedy, but it isn’t the part that involves flash drives, blackmail, and glowering, gun-toting bad guys.","67","1279935"
"10824","Po (Black) may be an animated panda bear, but make no mistake: Deep down he's really just a nerd with a pop-culture obsession.","67","441773"
"10825","Loud, rollicking, alternately ultra-violent and hilarious, Escape from L.A. is Snake redux, and what more do you need, really?","67","116225"
"10826","We're not watching McCauley and Hanna anymore; we're watching De Niro and Pacino trying to out-insinuate each other. For a few moments, Heat truly has some.","67","113277"
"10827","Focus only works if the balance of ingredients is right, and from the cast, Ficarra and Requa get everything they need.","67","2381941"
"10828","Frisky and oddball in ways that are sometimes annoying and more often ingratiating.","67","4925292"
"10829","Meaney’s Flintstone-ian brute makes a terrific foil to Sheen’s prissy arrogance, but the other supporting players don’t make much of an impression. Ditto for this slice of history itself, though mileage may vary for soccer fans.","67","1226271"
"10830","The film weaves comedy, horror, and romance without delving too deeply into any of them. The humor is rather dry (and completely dialogue-driven), and the horror only alluded to: There’s something chilling about certain things writer Mike Makowsky leaves to the imagination.","67","6169694"
"10831","Even with Gere’s standout work, a little of Norman goes a long way, and this film offers up a lot of Norman.","67","4191702"
"10832","It feels disingenuous to celebrate Doss' moral code by vividly pretending to demolish it. Nobody disputes the notion that war is hell. But maybe this particular war movie didn't need that.","67","2119532"
"10833","The first two-thirds of the film, which are like the Brothers Grimm's Greatest Hits on laughing gas, have a fizzy, fairy-dust energy. But as soon as the baker couple's scavenger hunt is over and a rampaging giant appears, Woods loses its magic and momentum and sags like an airless balloon.","67","2180411"
"10834","Burn After Reading, the new film from the Coen Brothers, won't be mistaken for ""Fargo"" anytime soon. Or ""Barton Fink,"" or ""The Man Who Wasn' There."" Those films were black comedy done to perfection.","67","887883"
"10835","All three leads give subtly wrenching performances that wouldn’t have been out of place in Ingmar Bergman’s oeuvre.","67","6304162"
"10836","If you’re looking for a thrilling whodunit, there’s nothing in this film that hasn’t been done – and done better – a dozen times before.","67","6628394"
"10837","I continually found myself longing for the sheer intensity of the director's past glories, like Jaws, or even Duel. Spielberg seems to be trying so very hard for that elusive “Gosh, Wow, Sense of Wonder!” that it all looks strained in spots.","67","107290"
"10838","Payback is a thriller so mean and degraded it carries a low-down, vicious charge. Sadism is its only real subject, and its only real life as well.","67","120784"
"10839","Boseman as Jackie Robinson and Beharie as Rachel Robinson both deliver terrific performances, and the cast of managers and ballplayers – are excellent. Harrison Ford plays Brooklyn Dodgers General Manager Branch Rickey as a larger-than-life eccentric, seeming almost like a demented Orville Redenbacher at times.","67","453562"
"10840","For all its faults, is a solid piece of dirty work.","67","235737"
"10841","I call Piranha 3D ''exploitation,'' rather than a quality scare movie, because it serves up well-timed gross-outs instead of genuine suspense and because the movie has no pretense of providing character, plot, acting, or dialogue that's anything more than boilerplate.","67","464154"
"10842","When it comes to this particular story, I find myself unconvinced in the end. Unbroken looks like the real thing, but evaporates upon closer scrutiny.","67","1809398"
"10843","Long on style and technique, short on substance and plot.","67","1060277"
"10844","While the quality of the film’s craft is up for little debate, though, it’s overall appeal and impact are far more polarizing.","67","5715874"
"10845","The middle of a movie is often where filmmakers lose their way, but Friends With Benefits nails this stretch, in which nothing very remarkable happens as two people talk, in bed and out of bed. There's a fine line between fun-dirty and ick-dirty – sometimes you can't identify the line until it's been crossed – and this film keeps its toes on the right side of raunch.","67","1632708"
"10846","In its final half-hour, all the stops are pulled. The movie is still wildly implausible but at least it's hurtling forward. The only thing missing from the proceedings is a windmill for John to tilt at.","67","1458175"
"10847","Meet Joe Black flows nicely, and the whole of the film is bathed in some of the most sumptuous cinematography (courtesy of ""Like Water for Chocolate's"" Emmanuel Lubezki) of the year.","67","119643"
"10848","How could someone so frail and terrified at the mere thought of acting in front of the camera become the biggest movie star in the world? And how could someone so unknowable become so familiar? Then the film makes the mistake of trying to answer these questions.","67","1655420"
"10849","The Road deviates from McCarthy's original text via a series of flashbacks to the man's pre-apocalyptic life with the woman (Theron) who both leaves her family behind and is in turn left behind by them.","67","898367"
"10850","For the most part, it works well at this level with the added bonus of some unexpected intellectual twists. The predominant thing that bogs down SWF is the script. It has too many plot holes to be fully believable and too little psychological background on our unbalanced roomie (and when it is revealed, it's revealed all in one stroke).","67","105414"
"10851","The pleasant surprises in Larry Crowne come from its side characters.","67","1583420"
"10852","Shyamalan's premise is a lulu, to be sure, but if you can manage that precious, tentative suspension of disbelief, you'll find Unbreakable a rewarding meditation on the nature of heroes, both comic book and otherwise.","67","217869"
"10853","Me and Earl is smart and appealing, but it spends way too much effort saying ""I'm not like that"" when it really is.","67","2582496"
"10854","In making the radical artistic choice to tell the story as if it were being enacted by players on a stage, Wright falls passionately in love with his own fanciful artifices.","67","1781769"
"10855","Cronenberg has a distinctive style – deadpan absurdism laced with fright and all executed with slow deliberation. But too much of Eastern Promises is cultish and silly.","67","765443"
"10856","Gordon-Levitt already proved in last year's ""Mysterious Skin"" his captivating command as a dramatic actor; with Brick he further demonstrates his remarkable dexterity and range.","67","393109"
"10857","The film lays on its politics-as-chess-game metaphor a little thick, however, and its refusal to leave the corridors of power to see the impact of its developments on the country at large makes it feel stuffy after a while.","67","962736"
"10858","Scene for scene, the duo are in good form. Yet this is one case where more turns out to be less.","67","115641"
"10859","It does effectively recall those bygone days when impossibly attractive, charming, and endearingly flawed characters dressed to kill, smoked like creosote plants, and behaved atrociously on the way to rapturous romantic consummation.","67","119738"
"10860","There’s a joy to the film’s ornate beauty, a loving craftsmanship that rescues Aquaman from the branded synergy that so haunts and chokes it elsewhere.","67","1477834"
"10861","Armie Hammer slyly steals the show as Ord, a very chill American arms dealer.","67","4158096"
"10862","Driven by another of Nick Cave and Warren Ellis’ murmuring folk soundtracks, Wind River turns out to be the weakest of Sheridan’s loose trilogy — the one with the thinnest characterizations and the toughest time disguising its subtext as plainspoken townsfolk rapport.","67","5362988"
"10863","The Descent may not be everything you've heard, but man, it's also a lot of things you haven't.","67","435625"
"10864","Triple Frontier lands a handful of thrilling sequences in a sea of familiar riffs on greed, masculinity, and the lingering traumas of war.","67","1488606"
"10865","Edge of Tomorrow is slick, but once its fancy plot dressing takes form, it has little more to offer aside from a few impressive action sequences and the infallible grin of its nimble lead.","67","1631867"
"10866","There are moments of levity throughout the film, but it’s made with pedestrian craft and feels more like a set-up and a series of vignettes than a compelling yarn. Chiefly, it demonstrates just how accomplished the Coens are even when their films seem offhanded and easy.","67","1234548"
"10867","Even an audience moved to tender patriotism might wonder how Scott, a proven master of ''Gladiator''-size visual showmanship, could have bombed away the personality of every man fighting until he's left with nothing more than pure combat.","67","265086"
"10868","It's a dazzling time capsule of a shimmering era and a devastating look into the dark side of the American dream. Too bad Luhrmann, the caffeinated conductor, doesn't trust that story enough. He'd rather blast your retinas into sugar-shock submission. Uncle, old sport! Uncle!","67","1343092"
"10869","Yes, this stuff is cool. It is also massively complex, presented with a straight face via a script that nevertheless winks at The Protagonist’s — and our — utter confusion as Tenet's byzantine plot unfolds.","67","6723592"
"10870","The movie's exterior is solid, but it's hollow inside, like a safe filled with air.","67","840361"
"10871","Hit-and-miss horror auteur Alexandre Aja knows how to deliver lean, mean horror action. Crawl is far less tongue-in-cheek than his Piranha remake, but it doesn’t build to a fever pitch or deliver dynamite setpieces.","68","8364368"
"10872","Ad Astra is grand but, rather frustratingly, it's not great. James Gray’s film is a most impressive technical achievement, and the first half is exciting and flirts with profundity. The second half, however, slows to a maddeningly sluggish pace, and the film ultimate leaves you worn out and disengaged.","68","2935510"
"10873","There’s gold in the premise of “The Purge” and its dismissal of subtlety. But like the residents of its world, when given the opportunity, it drops restraint and goes for blood.","68","2184339"
"10874","You Were Never Really Here feels remote and somnambulant—a bad dream viewers know will end after 90 minutes, never to disquiet them again. Its emotional stakes are inflated so overzealously that they scarcely register as stakes at all.","68","5742374"
"10875","Though far from a sophomore slump, Snatch, like ""Smoking Barrels,"" is such a grab bag of other influences that it's tough to figure out what, if anything, about Ritchie's style is uniquely his own.","68","208092"
"10876","A raunchy, scattershot, but often hilarious spoof.","68","175142"
"10877","A movie that feels like a series of beautifully and meticulously crafted tiles in a half-finished mosaic; you can admire the pieces but still come away feeling like you’ve been deprived of the whole.","68","2080374"
"10878","Writer-director Rian Johnson assembles the makings of a great whodunnit for Knives Out and winds up making a good one. It’s a perfectly entertaining film, but its attributes and apparent ambitions make the results just a bit disappointing.","68","8946378"
"10879","Where Stranger Things goes for subtle, Summer goes for on-the-nose. Where the Netflix show offers nuanced, empathetic characters, this film gives us cardboard cutouts with performances to match.","68","5774450"
"10880","While Bad Words is a little too dopey to take seriously, this is compensated for with a handful of truly amusing sequences.","68","2170299"
"10881","Elevates the horror genre with a refreshing intelligence and humor -- too bad it's not half as good at generating scares.","68","164181"
"10882","Ultimately seems at war with itself, torn between its duties as an entertaining, engaging movie and a somber, sincere memorial, and in splitting the difference, the film effectively assaults its audience almost as aggressively as its subjects.","68","1091191"
"10883","The right people have been hired, and everyone is where they’re supposed to be. That level of planning makes the heist in Ocean’s 8 run fairly smoothly. As for the film itself, similarly curated with care, it gets the job done without ever being one for the record books.","68","5164214"
"10884","Gilroy isn’t a drudge, of course, and Washington is Washington. If nothing else, the film rides on his mesmerizing performance and on Gilroy’s talent for character study. But after Nightcrawler, seeing Roman J. Israel, Esq. coast on craft rather than on transgression is nothing short of a letdown.","68","6000478"
"10885","Date Night isn't great; it's not really going for ""great."" But it's a well-executed comedy with a warm but not cloying center.","68","1279935"
"10886","A sequel of rare sincerity, Bill & Ted Face the Music avoids feeling like a craven reviving of a hollowed-out IP or a cynical reboot, mostly because its ambition is the stuff of affection—for what the filmmakers are doing, made with sympathy for their audience and a genuine desire to explore these characters in a new context. Maybe that’s the despair talking. Or maybe it’s just the relief of for once confronting the past and finding that it’s aged considerably well.","69","1086064"
"10887","Birth Of A Nation is powerful and effective, but it's spectacle that can't humanize or define its subject.","69","4196450"
"10888","This movie is all about sensation, about grooving on the very specific but unquestionably catchy hook Wright has laid down for you.","69","3890160"
"10889","For the most part, the DCEU just can’t square its admittedly exciting set pieces with solid storytelling. In turn, whenever Aquaman pops a squat to unload exposition, it grinds to an interminable halt. Those action scenes, though. Revolutionary at best, innovative at worst.","69","1477834"
"10890","There's no doubt that Eminem has the talent and presence of a star. It's just a shame that the filmmakers didn't capture his power with mad skillz of their own.","70","298203"
"10891","Director Andrew Stanton's Disney extravaganza is a rather charming pastiche.","70","401729"
"10892","The movie, directed by Simon West isn't bad, although the repeated shots of Campbell lying spread-eagled on the ground, and the amount of detail we're forced to swallow about the horrors she underwent border on the offensive.","70","144214"
"10893","The freshest and most stimulating aspect of the film is the visual style, which unites the expected Marvel mix of “universes” (it used to be assumed there was only one universe in creation) with animation that looks both computer-driven and hand-drawn, boasts futuristic as well as funky urban elements, moves the “camera” a lot and brings together a melting pot of mostly amusing new characters.","70","4633694"
"10894","Eastwood is a more forceful actor than he was twenty years ago--less opaque, less stylized, and altogether more idiosyncratic. He's too old and unsuited by temperament to play the tough city newspaper reporter in this film, but he still has an authority that few younger actors could match.","70","139668"
"10895","Bill Murray as FDR? It takes a few minutes to get used to, but once he settles into the role of the 32nd president, the idiosyncratic comic actor does a wonderfully jaunty job of it in Hyde Park on Hudson.","70","1477855"
"10896","Ishtar is an unabashed vamp for a pair of household names, and as such it works, often hilariously.","70","93278"
"10897","Distinctive and amusing turns by Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali make Peter Farrelly’s first solo feature outing a lively and likable diversion.","70","6966692"
"10898","Maggie's Plan is a fun light comedy with memorable characters, from a writer-director who lives up to her lineage (Arthur Miller's her dad), but it relies heavily on Gerwig's predictable charm and sometimes seems more Woody Allen than Rebecca Miller.","70","3471098"
"10899","Director Anne Fletcher delivers more bite and brisker pacing than she did with ""27 Dresses.""","70","1041829"
"10900","This tertiary adventure delivers welcome yet nonessential fun, landing well after its creators have grown up and succeeded toying with more sophisticated stories.","70","435761"
"10901","This film is vital in uncovering a hazard that was kept hidden for far too long. At last the secret is out, and Landesman and his fine cast will help to keep the conversation going.","70","3322364"
"10902","Moonrise Kingdom represents a sort of non-magical Neverland -- that momentous instant when the world can seem so small and a naive crush can feel all-consuming.","70","1748122"
"10903","Works as a heart-warming, involving experience.","70","264796"
"10904","Scott and Plummer may deserve a standing ovation for taking a powerful stand amid the #metoo movement. If only the rest of All the Money the World was as powerful.","70","5294550"
"10905","A collection of swashbuckling set pieces with the hustle of a vaudeville show.","70","383574"
"10906","As much as it's open about its paranoia of the new, Skyfall's fatal misstep is its slavish hewing to event-movie trends. Like this summer's Spider-Man, Batman, and Avengers movies, Skyfall seems to exist primarily to set up the events of subsequent films.","70","1074638"
"10907","From ""Beavis and Butt-Head"" to ""King of the Hill"" to ""Office Space,"" Mike Judge has become our most dogged examiner of middle-American foolishness; no other comedy filmmaker more skillfully exploits that nagging sense that you’re surrounded by idiots.","70","1225822"
"10908","A surreal, demented delight.","70","94721"
"10909","The film offers us Mel Gibson as a new Bret Maverick, the Western gambler, as well as the old TV Maverick, James Garner, now playing a wry frontier sheriff. These two guys can make you smile contentedly even when the script is wandering and they're just sort of standing around waiting for its next good part to develop.","70","110478"
"10910","Pic's happiest surprise is Tobey Maguire in the title role, as the young actor provides an emotional openness and vulnerability that gives this $120 million production its most distinctive flavor.","70","145487"
"10911","It may not be great but you're guaranteed to feel great walking out the theater door.","70","362227"
"10912","On the whole, the eek-for-yuks trade-off is more than fair--hip without being campy or condescending to one of the better movie franchises. [1 Dec 1997, p. 84]","70","118583"
"10913","This ambitious debut features flashes of imaginative visuals, quirky dialogue, and well-meaning messages about gentrification and disenfranchisement.","70","4353250"
"10914","Predators is sometimes silly and hardly original, but it delivers the thrills.","70","1424381"
"10915","A subtle and often surprising study of the relationship between damaged adult siblings, full of mordant humor and dramatic invention.","70","203230"
"10916","For those who take Mr. King seriously, this is high-proof King corn, which is to say it has a kick to it even though it hasn't much taste.","70","87050"
"10917","As formula films go, The Bounty Hunter is more enjoyable than most, even if it packs in as many cliches as any.","70","1038919"
"10918","With his snowy white hair and moustache to match, Hanks conveys a man confident in his abilities, yet humble in his actions, which could also be said of Eastwood as a director.","70","3263904"
"10919","A popcorn movie that reaches back to the fantasy epics of old and forward into the digital future, where the word ""unimaginable"" no longer exists.","70","800320"
"10920","If Dick Wolf is interested in doing a ""Law & Order: Cyber Crimes,"" he could do worse than to follow the lead of Untraceable, a diverting police procedural about an FBI unit tasked with sleuthing the Internet for mouse-wielding bad guys.","70","880578"
"10921","Sean Penn delivers a compelling, ambitious work that will satisfy most admirers of the book.","70","758758"
"10922","Seeing it once is fine, but seeing it every day for the rest of your life is not recommended.","70","107048"
"10923","This spirited and often very funny lark accomplishes something that most films in the bygone Hollywood studio era used to do but is remarkably rare in today's world of niche markets: It offers entertainment equally to viewers from 4 to 104.","70","126029"
"10924","The over-all production is very handsome, and the performances fine, especially Newman, Redford, and Miss Ross, who must be broadly funny and straight, almost simultaneously.","70","64115"
"10925","[Craven's] stroke of genius is to offer the horror movie in an ironic mode. He's winking at viewers and inviting them to share a clever conspiracy that we on the cholesterol-clogged side of 30 cannot begin to understand.","70","120082"
"10926","The film’s drama is B-movie basic. But the destructive colliding metal-on-metal inferno of what war is makes Midway a picture worth seeing.","70","6924650"
"10927","A canny, ingeniously crafted guilty pleasure.","70","165929"
"10928","Despite the preponderance of (PG-rated) snogging, there are pleasures to be found along this movie's meandering path.","70","417741"
"10929","Batman Begins summons up moments of great eloquence and power. If only its cast of characters was as fully inhabited as its turbulent city.","70","372784"
"10930","In nearly every scene, Wahlberg carries off the central role with what could be called determined elan.","70","2039393"
"10931","At times, it approaches some of Pixar's best.","70","1446192"
"10932","There's a lot to admire in The Brave One. It just doesn't cut as deeply as it needs to.","70","476964"
"10933","If The Fighter feels like kind of a mess, lurching from one scene to the next as if the film itself has taken a few hits to the head, that's not entirely a bad thing.","70","964517"
"10934","This understated period drama may lack sufficient star power and emotional wallop to score breakthrough success with mainstream auds during its domestic theatrical run, but pic could find a warmer response in the same international markets where ""Kingdom of Heaven"" redeemed itself last year.","70","375154"
"10935","To kill time between action set-pieces, del Toro has done an above-average job of avoiding tedium via some flavorsome casting, passably interesting plot contrivances and, above all, by maintaining strong forward momentum. Unlike so many similar crash-bang action spectaculars, this one feels lean and muscular rather than bloated or padded; the combat is almost always coherent and dramatically pointed rather than just splashed on the screen for its own sake.","70","1663662"
"10936","Encircles the viewer in a comforting, open-hearted humanism. It’s a quiet, modest piece of work, but no less lovely for it.","70","268690"
"10937","Rabbit Hole could easily have been maudlin, grim or exploitative, and it is none of those things. It is sensitive, considerate, and, in the end, not entirely persuasive.","70","935075"
"10938","Mathis and Bullock are especially good, and Phoenix and Mulroney, playing out a jealousy-prone friendship as if they were Jeff Bridges and Timothy Bottoms in Bogdanovich's The Last Picture Show, do a fair job with their roles.","70","108327"
"10939","Romero's fourth entry, turns out to be his most conventional as an action thriller--though it's every bit as gory as the others and more clearly class-conscious.","70","418819"
"10940","The icy reserve that sometimes stands in the way of Kidman's expressive gifts here becomes the foundation of her most emotionally layered performance to date.","70","230600"
"10941","Unfolds with a patient intelligence. The Sixth Sense might not scare you out of your wits, but it could reward them.","70","167404"
"10942","That the film itself is nearly as chaotic as the clan it examines can either be regarded as an admirable artistic correlative or a crippling defect, but the splendidly dextrous cast ensures that this goofy success story, which could just easily be titled American Hustle 2, keeps firing on all cylinders in the manner of the writer-director's previous few outings.","70","2446980"
"10943","The language has been changed to English, of course, which is the only real reason this movie exists; the story development, desolate tone, and key set pieces are mostly copied from the original movie, which in turn was based on a novel by John Ajvide Lindqvist.","70","1228987"
"10944","It would be nice, for instance, to meet some white man, other than Dunbar [Costner], who is not a brutish lout. And it would not harm the film if there were one or two bad-natured Sioux visible in it. [12 Nov 1990, p.102]","70","99348"
"10945","This follow-up is faster and campier than its mostly somber predecessor, but the basic grim tenets of British horror author Clive Barker's supernatural worldview are still intact: a universe with a senseless hell but no heaven, without a god but with plenty of demons, without real good but oozing evil to spare.","70","95294"
"10946","Honey, I Shrunk the Kids pulls some familiar plot - and emotional strings. It's a tad too predictable. But it's resourceful and well-crafted. It's the type of movie that works on one level for parents and another for kids. Both will be pleased. [23 June 1989, p.12]","70","97523"
"10947","Scorsese is exceptionally good at guiding his largely unknown cast to near-flawless recreations of types. Outstanding in this regard is De Niro.","70","70379"
"10948","Masterfully charted and adeptly played, but also rather minimalist.","70","781435"
"10949","Phoenix is an arresting presence on screen, but don't expect any ""Departed""-esque fast talk from Wahlberg, who is oddly inert in a role that should crackle with brotherly ambivalence.","70","498399"
"10950","Considering how firmly the image of Popeye is fixed in the minds of all spinach-bred Americans, it's daring of the film to open by showing the character in its familiar cartoon form. But Robin Williams so utterly captures the Popeye idea as to justify this, and Shelley Duvall is such a perfect Olive Oyl that it will always be difficult to imagine her impersonating a human being. [19 Dec 1980, p.20]","70","81353"
"10951","From the start, this character plays to the star's strengths, merging subject and object, warrior and victim, ass-kicker and damsel-in-distress. And hero and villain.","70","944835"
"10952","It's sweet-spirited, visually delightful (if aurally cacophonous), and it will make for a pleasant enough family afternoon at the movies. But we've come to expect so much more than mere pleasantness from Pixar that Cars 2 feels almost like a betrayal.","70","1216475"
"10953","At heart a Frank Capra-style social fable for the '90s.","70","140397"
"10954","The problem with the film, despite the genius of craftmanship and cinematography, is that the film doesn't really have anything new to say.","70","206634"
"10955","So well made, and so compelling as a portrait of a man at war with himself, that, right up until the end, many people will probably be entertained by its intricately preposterous story.","70","780571"
"10956","The material is consistently clever and funny.","70","88258"
"10957","What lifts the production above the run-of-the-mill is swift direction by Martha Coolidge, who has a firm grasp over the manic material.","70","89886"
"10958","One would have to be totally tone-deaf not to notice that the director, Andrew Davis, has inflicted a broad cartoon style on adult performers who are distinctly uncomfortable with it.","70","311289"
"10959","Reitman deserves credit for going through with a bitterly ironic ending, but the movie is marred by its warm condescension toward flyover country.","70","1193138"
"10960","Good as it is, The Legend of Zorro would be a hollow feat without leads who are drop-dead-gorgeous movie stars and spectacular clowns.","70","386140"
"10961","Quaid's effortlessly compelling and engagingly earnest performance keeps pic grounded in down-to-earth reality.","70","265662"
"10962","Director Jeannot Szwarc could have done more with the action scenes, but he has a snappy sense of pace and comic timing. Blond, blue-eyed Slater brings an engaging sweetness to Supergirl; and she plays Linda with an awkward, gawky girlishness, subtly different from her Supergirl role.","70","88206"
"10963","The black/white duality isn't terribly interesting, but as in most of Aronofsky's films, an intense horror of the body and its uncontrollability fuels the rhapsodic psychodrama.","70","947798"
"10964","There’s no denying, though, that Daniels knows how to push an audience’s buttons, and as crudely obvious as The Butler can be...it’s also genuinely rousing. By the end, it’s hard not to feel moved, if also more than a bit manhandled.","70","1327773"
"10965","Under the Silver Lake isn’t an homage so much as a remix of classic Hollywood tropes, which positions itself and its contemporary hipster characters less as the continuation of history than the end of it.","70","5691670"
"10966","Apatow is on the right track. In moving his adolescent male comedies into more adult realms, the humor sharpens and characters deepen.","70","1201167"
"10967","Writer-director David Twohy (Pitch Black) serves up mechanical thrills culminating in a bogus twist ending.","70","971209"
"10968","Stiller's sensibility creates a movie that's smarter than you think it will be.","70","359950"
"10969","It is impressive enough that Paltrow holds your eye as a parade of lovelies and virtuoso actresses (Greta Scacchi, Polly Walker, Juliet Stevenson) march past. But her finest trick is to provide a comic subtext to Emma.","70","116191"
"10970","With a refreshing absence of earnestness, the movie mainly spins out many variations on a theme: Easy Street begins and ends on Capitol Hill. [03 Dec 1992]","70","104114"
"10971","What stays with you finally is not the mystery's byzantine twists and turns, which are fun but don't resonate very deeply. It's the time, the place, the palpable feel of community. [2 Oct 1995, p.85]","70","112857"
"10972","Dominating it all is Cumberbatch, whose charisma, tellingly modulated and naturalistic array of eccentricities, Sherlockian talent at indicating a mind never at rest and knack for simultaneously portraying physical oddness and attractiveness combine to create an entirely credible portrait of genius at work.","70","2084970"
"10973","Although some of the film’s many twists are not that surprising, they’re satisfyingly delivered, and with a strong supporting cast ...plus striking dream imagery, this adds up to arguably the best in the franchise so far.","70","3062096"
"10974","A trashily entertaining reptilian version of ''Jaws'' set in the steaming heart of the Amazon rain forest.","70","118615"
"10975","The second version of The Man Who Knew Too Much, which Hitchcock made in 1956, is a curious film. Some of it doesn't really work.","70","49470"
"10976","For all that it is, as promised, about love, it's also a subtly punishing affair that grinds you into the ground as you watch an elderly couple deal with one member's slow deterioration of health and sanity.","70","1602620"
"10977","In the musical numbers, where by rights Mr. Travolta should shine, he's almost out-danced and certainly out-charmed by Edna's better half, Wilbur (Christopher Walken), who is one of the movie's great assets, an oasis of calm amid the twisting and shouting.","70","427327"
"10978","Steve Guttenberg, Daniel Stern, Mickey Rourke, Kevin Bacon, Paul Reiser and Timothy Daly are terrific as the friends as are Ellen Barkin and Kathryn Dowling as the two females involved with different group members.","70","83833"
"10979","Half the film is an ingenuous love story, but the better half consists of pop culture time-warp jokes set in 1985.","70","120888"
"10980","It's a film with a number of strengths, not the least of them its fierce, agile, hollow-eyed hero.","70","83944"
"10981","Parts of this three-hour World War II epic are brilliant -- especially the 40-minute sequence in which the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor is stunningly re-created.","70","213149"
"10982","Genuinely disturbing in its vision of fearless students and powerless teachers locked in struggle.","70","118531"
"10983","Richardson, who gracefully sways through a memorable drunk scene, and Quaid, whose megawatt smile has never been more dazzling, are disarmingly charming as the parents. And that's important; if the actors were any less engaging, the audience might not be so forgiving of their characters.","70","120783"
"10984","It is a well written, nicely acted and smoothly directed battle of the sexes.","70","337741"
"10985","While there's nothing original in Rush Hour, it runs through its well-worn paces with both wit and excitement.","70","120812"
"10986","Let's not kid ourselves: There's something about Javi.","70","497465"
"10987","It's hard to wholeheartedly recommend The Hitcher. Sadistic and graphically, pointlessly violent, it may leave most sickened. But it is also a distressingly effective thriller, with plenty of scalp-tingling, seat- clutching squeals on wheels. And here's betting you'll check the back seat of your car after you leave.","70","91209"
"10988","Three hours and 20 minutes of Al Pacino suffering openly, Robert Duvall suffering silently, Diane Keaton suffering noisily, and (every so often) Robert De Niro suffering good-naturedly is almost too much, but Francis Ford Coppola pulls it off in grand style.","70","71562"
"10989","It is a dark, lurid revenge fantasy and not the breakthrough, star-making movie some people have claimed. But it is a genre film of a high order, stylish and smooth.","70","109506"
"10990","Star-studded and stylish, this addition to the brothers’ acclaimed canon is a looker with laughs and, alas, dull stretches. It’s fun and entertaining — no more, no less, no exclamation point.","70","475290"
"10991","Hidden Figures is empowerment cinema at its most populist, and one only wishes that the film had existed at the time it depicts — though ongoing racial tensions and gender double-standards suggest that perhaps we haven’t come such a long way, baby.","70","4846340"
"10992","As much as I enjoyed its cheap thrills and its exquisite craft, Dressed to Kill left me wanting something more from De Palma.He has begun to borrow from himself -- one crucial twist is lifted shamelessly from ""Carrie"" -- and his jokey disregard for psychological plausibility (most evident in his disastrous ""Obsession"") is beginning to seem just lazy. It may seem unfair to ask for more depth from De Palma when his surfaces give so much pleasure, but from a director this prodigiously talented one expects miracles. Dressed to Kill takes his series of Hitchcockian homages about as far as they can go. It's exhilarating dead-end moviemaking, and one eagerly awaits his next move. [4 Aug 1980, p.61]","70","80661"
"10993","A completely adequate modern facsimile of the classic romantic epic.","70","112573"
"10994","The plot, directed by Michael Curtiz, is thin but warm-hearted. [22 Dec 2014]","70","47673"
"10995","This heavy-hitting fist lands with calculated deliberation. Despite Spielberg's obviously genuine commitment, ""Schindler's List"" feels strangely controlled -- more than impassioned. It's officially artistic, an engineered project of pride, Little Stevie's growing-up project, rather than an organically brilliant masterpiece.","70","108052"
"10996","This is one of those movies whose empty-headed premise is so pure it's witty: with his insatiable need for excitement, the hero is a perfect stand-in for the fanboys in the audience.","70","479884"
"10997","I, Tonya is not by any means a weeper. It’s a black comedy, and parts of it are too broad, like a second-rate Coen brothers movie.","70","5580036"
"10998","A gloriously sentimental true-life drama","70","166943"
"10999","Although the film flies off the rails in its climax, the rest of Brigsby Bear is an outrageous concept that’s pulled off quite well.","70","5805752"
"11000","The social comment of the original has been historically refined to encompass such plausible eventualities as the physical manifestation of atomic war weapons. But the basic spirit of Wells' work has not been lost.","70","54387"
"11001","Visually spectacular and consistently entertaining, Ridley Scott’s space rescue procedural The Martian suffers only from a failure to hit its emotional beats with the amount of force and feeling usually required to make this kind of life-and-death adventure really take off.","70","3659388"
"11002","It is up to young English thesp Bale to engage the viewer's interest, which he does superbly.","70","92965"
"11003","You come away from Boiler Room eager to see what Younger will do next.","70","181984"
"11004","Something rare: a mess of a movie that is somehow infectious, and infectious not despite the mess, but because of it.","70","160127"
"11005","There's something impressive and yet lacking about everything.","70","257044"
"11006","The action at the center of Chris Columbus' script occasionally falters and generally feels manufactured, but the kids go about their chores as if convinced that all their make-believe is true.","70","89218"
"11007","I won't pretend to understand the movie's deep meaning--if it has one--but I can say three things for sure: Mr. Rockwell gives a brilliant performance, the physical production is impressive and Moon made me think. Four things: It made me smile.","70","1182345"
"11008","Smith has fashioned a complex, contemporary Bible epic on his own terms. By turns crafty and clunky, pious and profane, it's clearly a labor of love.","70","120655"
"11009","More creepy and flesh-crawling than overwhelmingly gory, it nevertheless takes pride in characters who get splattered with blood as often as take-out fries get doused with catsup.","70","162661"
"11010","Depp's tight, guarded performance is almost painful to watch, and Newell seems to have reined in the flamboyant Pacino, whose portrait of the mobster as a grumpy old woman may be his best work in years.","70","119008"
"11011","The War of the Worlds is one of those movies that many who grew up in the '50s remember fondly as a mix of science-fiction melodrama and crashingly good mayhem. Nostalgia goes a long way toward appreciating it today. [13 Aug 1992, p.15]","70","46534"
"11012","In the way of most Apatow films, Trainwreck is a little too long, a little too shaggy and a little too conservative in insisting that all’s square in love and war.","70","3152624"
"11013","The formula, with its comforting arrangement of familiar elements, is what we're after, and The World Is Not Enough certainly comes through on that front.","70","143145"
"11014","Joel Schumacher's Twelve, the latest expose of self-indulgence among privileged teens, is sleek, giddy fun.","70","1407084"
"11015","The screenplay represents recycling at its best. The material has been successfully refurbished with new jokes and new attitudes, but the earlier film's most memorable moments have been preserved.","70","101862"
"11016","Like ""The Verdict,"" this is a big, crowd-pleasing Hollywood redemption drama in which the lonely hero not only thwarts the corporate villains in the end but silences them with a killer riposte.","70","465538"
"11017","Suburbicon is a solid, pleasing piece, even if it never quite reaches the bleak heights its set-up promises.","70","491175"
"11018","A ""guilty pleasure"" -- only it's the sort of film that would mock anyone who felt guilt in pleasure.","70","139134"
"11019","OK, the plot is inane, Val-gal-speak is a clichT, and Heckerling was more incisive covering similar hormonal ground 13 years ago in ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High."" But there's still wicked good fun to be had.","70","112697"
"11020","Star Trek III has a genuine spirituality, and, at its end, you may be surprised, especially if you're not really a Trekkie, to realize how moved you've been.","70","88170"
"11021","A polished, engrossing procedural, Spotlight offers plenty of old-fashioned pleasures — chiefly, the sight of smart, scrappy muckraking journalists stopping at nothing to uncover systematic corruption.","70","1895587"
"11022","Honest curiosity and observation are what make this work, and in this respect Christina Ricci (as Wuornos's lover, Selby Wall) is almost as good as Theron.","70","340855"
"11023","The picture tries hard for addictive mystery, but it is full of scenes that promise insight and don't deliver.","70","443706"
"11024","This winning confection, from a director (Heavy, Cop Land) not known for the lightness of his material or his touch, shows a fine understanding of what the screenwriters of the '40s instinctively grasped, that good screwball is about dialogue and chemistry.","70","35423"
"11025","Essentially and very effectively a rollicking smash-and-crash chase movie that happens to be surprisingly well acted.","70","1599348"
"11026","Perhaps the most formally ravishing-as well as the most morally and ideologically problematic-film ever directed by Martin Scorsese.","70","75314"
"11027","Missing lacks the streamlined tension of the dynamically paced, left-wing political thrillers -- Z, The Confession and State of Siege -- that made Costa-Gavras' reputation a few years back. Nevertheless, it's an expertly acted and suggestive impression of battered American innocence and good will in the explosive, political environment of a South American country (obviously Chile, 1973) during a military coup. [12 Feb 1982, p.C1]","70","84335"
"11028","Distinguishes itself with three-dimensional characters and an engaging storyline.","70","889573"
"11029","The result is a lopsided yet absorbing movie in which the director is less drawn to his main characters than to those on the periphery.","70","482571"
"11030","Enough Said may be her cleanest, most polished and broadly funny effort to date; its emotional generosity is undeniable, but so is its tendency to smooth over some of the hard, brittle edges that have been the more interesting hallmarks of Holofcener’s work.","70","2390361"
"11031","Death to Smoochy is often very funny, but what's even more remarkable is the integrity of DeVito's misanthropic vision.","70","266452"
"11032","The surprising thing about George Lucas's first feature (1971), a dystopian SF parable now digitally enhanced and expanded by five minutes, is how arty it seems compared to his later movies.","70","66434"
"11033","Largely free of generic horror-movie elements, such as exploitative torture and murder scenes. Those it does contain draw attention to the difference between the conventions of psychological drama and those of pulp horror.","70","118636"
"11034","Although a touch too precious and slight, 20th Century Women is lit from within by its endless curiosity about its evolving characters.","70","4385888"
"11035","Hackman works with a joyous authority that seems to come out of the experience of the character he's playing. He liberates David Mamet from David Mamet. [12 Nov 2001, p. 139]","70","252503"
"11036","Niccol gives audiences a very amusing puzzle about authenticity, fraud, and the uses and abuses of technology. That is a fine and funny feat. The very folks responsible for our obsession with celebrity will likely love it. And in loving it, they will no doubt let themselves off the hook.","70","258153"
"11037","A fine character study and a solid look at a specific political movement and a certain time and place.","70","1013753"
"11038","Sunshine does for sci-fi what ""28 Days Later"" . . . did for the zombie movie -- its tale about a manned space mission to the sun preys on our growing fear of obliteration as we confront global warming.","70","448134"
"11039","Stingy with details and dialogue, but more than generous with atmosphere, this seductively photographed thriller (written and directed by Jeremy Saulnier, who also wielded the camera) sells its empty calories with great skill.","70","2359024"
"11040","There's delight to be had from watching Burton conjure up one fantastical Edward-inspired scenario after another.","70","319061"
"11041","One expects more from writer-director Wes Anderson (and his co-scribbler, Owen Wilson) than such frivolous fun that bears no lingering effect.","70","265666"
"11042","While we do get a bit of gore, the movie is really about this wacky bunch of people jumping on each other's nerves, kind of a zany hero's journey.","70","139414"
"11043","You cheer the good guys, gasp at the cliffhangers, hiss the villains and leave the theater with an old-fashioned sense of satisfaction. It may not be great filmmaking -- it's certainly not for purists -- but it's definitely good fun. [24 June 1991, p.60]","70","102798"
"11044","John Carney’s 1980s-set Sing Street is like a barnstorming tribute group. It’s crowd-pleasing, heart-warming, hits all the right notes, and is eager to please.","70","3544112"
"11045","A bit of advice: Get to ""The Naked Gun 2½"" on time and plan to stay till they turn the lights back on. The opening and closing credits alone are almost worth the price of admission.","70","102510"
"11046","The weight of the film rests on the shoulders of Hawke and Delpy, and they're both remarkable.","70","112471"
"11047","Wild Tales opens and closes with a bang, and at its best is a riotously funny and cathartic exorcism of the frustrations of contemporary life.","70","3011894"
"11048","Jon Amiel, who previously directed ""Sommersby,"" delivers a taut, gripping thriller and, with the help of his accomplished leads, succeeds in camouflaging some of the mammoth holes in Ann Biderman and David Madsen's otherwise intelligent and inventive screenplay.","70","112722"
"11049","The Madame Bovary-in-suburbia motif may sound familiar, yet the unusual mix of satire and melodrama feels fresh. Not everything works (beware the football scenes), but this adaptation of Tom Perrotta's novel is hard to shake off.","70","404203"
"11050","Much like Pakula's ""Presumed Innocent"", this is a solid and intelligent, if unspectacular adaptation, and just a tad tighter than The Firm to give it the edge that's needed.","70","107798"
"11051","The film is not a classic of the genre, but it definitely falls into the upper echelon of the “worthy entry” category, and Steinfeld and Harrelson worthier still.","70","1878870"
"11052","Tully has its heart (and many other things) in the right place, but by the end you wish it had an imagination finely executed enough to match its empathy.","70","5610554"
"11053","Assume that viewers are too hungry for mindless thrills to care whether dead characters spring back to life or live ones change their personalities according to the needs of the moment.","70","161081"
"11054","Perry benefits from the fire, heft, velocity, and lyricism of the language, but he also updates the material and makes it work onscreen, eliciting powerhouse performances from an ensemble of actresses.","70","1405500"
"11055","Fortunately, the movie is studded with performances that demonstrate the cast's skills, such as Kristen Wiig's soggy white-bread delusional Christian Ruth.","70","1092026"
"11056","It's not without moments of wit and powerful emotion, but somehow Stepmom never feels either real enough to move us deeply or bubbly enough to make us forget our woes.","70","120686"
"11057","Tailored to a point rather than to comprehensive biography, its triumph is its touch upon the public nerve of our most private inhibition. [30 Dec 1974, p.86]","70","71746"
"11058","In the last 15 minutes of the film, he burns up some of the credibility he established by not pushing extreme situations too far earlier on.","70","1855199"
"11059","In the middle of this confident retread, the director, Peter Hewitt, and the writers, Chris Matheson and Ed Solomon, sandwich something far more free and funny--a slapstick version of ""The Seventh Seal"" in which Bill and Ted play games with Death.","70","101452"
"11060","Quartet is very much a performance piece, which plays to Hoffman's strength - as an actor he knows when to allow this excellent ensemble breathing room and when to tighten the belt.","70","1441951"
"11061","With an arsenal of cool f/x at their disposal, the Wachowskis have come up with a dizzyingly enjoyable junk movie that has just enough on its mind to keep the pleasure from being a guilty one.","70","133093"
"11062","As good as Rourke is, and as willingly as he throws himself on the figurative hand grenade, his performance constantly begs the question of whether the story would be worth telling without him. Marisa Tomei, as Cassidy the pole dancer, delivers a courageous performance, one nearly as ego-battering as Rourke's.","70","1125849"
"11063","Putting it mildly, this style of shallow, panting composition isn't the way I’d like movies to go, but, of its kind, The Bourne Supremacy is incredibly skilled--much more exciting than its predecessor.","70","372183"
"11064","A movie that's dazzling as you watch it and immediately unsatisfying afterward.","70","120891"
"11065","Thanks largely to the dexterity of director John Badham and the irresistibly fresh attractiveness of the young leads, Matthew Broderick and Ally Sheedy, WarGames contains enough entertaining suspense and more than enough personality appeal to finesse many of its implausible plot twists. [3 June 1983, p.B1]","70","86567"
"11066","It takes place in an artificial world constructed largely from the mythology of other movies, and, though it's both seamless and stylish, some find it a little too self-conscious for its own good.","70","100150"
"11067","Highly entertaining, but that’s about all.","70","88763"
"11068","While it celebrates the triumph of humor, invention and the human spirit, Life Is Beautiful is not the transporting experience it might have been. Benigni knows how to make us laugh, but he has not yet figured out how to make us cry.","70","118799"
"11069","Lelio, whose A Fantastic Woman won the Oscar this year for Best Foreign Language Film, has a knack for observing small moments as well as huge dilemmas.","70","6108178"
"11070","The Zero Theorem is a spectacle that demands to be cherished — as long as the society Gilliam portrays is a satire, not a prophesy.","70","2333804"
"11071","In addition to being a rather fine addition to the Christmas-movie canon, the film marks a useful teaching tool — a better option for classroom screenings than any of the previous “Carol” adaptations, once students have finished reading the novella.","70","6225520"
"11072","Betty Thomas, directing a script by TV veteran Jeff Lowell, seems uncertain whether to sympathize with her three heroines or with the title cad, but there's something mildly charming about this cheerful revenge comedy's lack of any straightforward moral agenda.","70","455967"
"11073","While the other Predator films tried to remain dark and tense, tossing in a decent one-liner here or there, Black’s movie is so cleverly over-the-top that it’s easy and pleasurable enough to watch, though never exactly scary or suspenseful.","70","3829266"
"11074","Tombstone is a tough-talking but soft-hearted tale that is entertaining in a sprawling, old-fashioned manner.","70","108358"
"11075","The old hands still seem to be having a good time, so why the hell shouldnít we?","70","122151"
"11076","Bizarre, utterly original and truly indescribable comedy...You just have to see it for yourself.","70","120601"
"11077","So why does Eight Legged Freaks make one laugh out loud even though there is nothing revolutionary about its approach to the giant bug genre? -- the movie is so unapologetic in its crassness that it disarms even the fussiest connoisseur of throwaway disaster flicks.","70","271367"
"11078","Only fitfully does the film manage the kind of lift-off as that achieved by Pynchon's often riotous 2009 novel and, most disappointingly, it offers only a pale and narrow physical recreation of such a vibrant place and time.","70","1791528"
"11079","Audiences willing to just go with the movie’s outlandish lead character will find laughs and thrills along the way, as well as that rarest of studio properties: a tentpole that actually leaves you enthusiastic about the prospect of a sequel.","70","2140479"
"11080","Pleasingly glossy, refreshingly snarky and startlingly sexy.","70","1142988"
"11081","Beverly Hills Cop is no masterpiece, but it uses Murphy to maximum effect. At its best, the movie is exactly as brazen, charming and mercurial as Murphy himself, which is to say it is unimaginable without him. [3 Dec. 1984, p.81]","70","86960"
"11082","Happy Death Day is “Groundhog Day” dipped in blood, and if the movie isn’t all that clever, it’s just clever enough to get by.","70","5308322"
"11083","Forbes' story and her direction of it may seem too sunny for some. But she keeps us refreshingly off-balance throughout, by letting us in on her memories the way she recalls them.","70","1969062"
"11084","Inevitably softened by hints of self-congratulation concerning the success of Woodward and Bernstein's uncovering of the Watergate affair, Pakula's film is nevertheless remarkably intelligent, working both as an effective thriller (even though we know the outcome of their investigations) and as a virtually abstract charting of the dark corridors of corruption and power.","70","74119"
"11085","Mr. Burton's new Batman Returns is as sprightly as its predecessor was sluggish, and it succeeds in banishing much of the dourness and tedium that made the first film such an ordeal.","70","103776"
"11086","Towards the end of the ride you are ready to get off... but if ride films are your thing, you'll be surprised at how much you enjoy this, even if you don't remember much about it afterwards.","70","101272"
"11087","See The Two Popes for its fine performances, but don’t be tempted by its naïveté.","70","8404614"
"11088","Unfolding and sounding like a novel, Hartley's ensemble of lower-class losers clash and repel in a startlingly, unpreachy lesson about the importance and danger of influences.","70","122529"
"11089","Chronicle plays like an extended episode of ""The X-Files"" might; DeHaan in particular comes off like one of the series' more-memorable characters. That's a compliment. It isn't a great movie, but one could imagine -- and hope -- that it becomes a cult favorite, outlasting other films of its ilk.","70","1706593"
"11090","Willis O'Brien did the stop-action animation for this 1933 feature, which is richer in character than most of the human cast.","70","24216"
"11091","The increasingly broad strokes with which the story is painted serve to simplify rather than deepen it, and to make it seem more artificially constructed than need be.","70","118887"
"11092","Ultimately Fury is a good, conventional war movie that might have become something more.","70","2713180"
"11093","It hasn’t always been easy trying to figure out what’s going through the mind of the 44th president of the United States, but Barry is a satisfyingly curious, honest attempt to make his inner struggle a beautiful part of this groundbreaking statesman’s biography.","70","5477566"
"11094","Although Mr. Chayefsky has written a very contemporary melodramatic farce, his political sympathies have their roots in the liberalism of 20 years ago.","70","67217"
"11095","Blanchett's quietly radiant performance anchors even the most outrageous plot developments, and she's well-supported on all sides.","70","219699"
"11096","It’s an unwieldy, sometimes overreaching effort, but the laudable ambition makes it easy to forgive some rough patches.","70","1959490"
"11097","Politeness may be the film’s weakest point, whether with its characters or bedroom scenes. But it’s hardly something to complain about, especially when the company is this lively.","70","5437928"
"11098","To underestimate actors of this caliber -- even in a popcorn action flick -- would be dangerous indeed.","70","1245526"
"11099","A nifty little war movie that defies convenient categorization.","70","120188"
"11100","There's a huge change that turns the nihilistic carnage of Craven's original into something suffused with old-fashioned family values, so that we can relax and enjoy watching the bad guys get beaten, skewered, dismembered by garbage disposals, and tortured with microwave ovens.","70","844708"
"11101","This always enjoyable tale of mysterious magic, imperiled princesses and square-jawed men of action proves longer on striking visuals than on truly engaging or memorable characters.","70","2294629"
"11102","The tone is both goofier and darker than the Potter pictures, and some of the magic battles built around New York City landmarks are eye-popping; there's also a genuinely affecting romance between Baruchel and fetching newcomer Teresa Palmer.","70","963966"
"11103","There’s some truly nasty stuff here — both violence-wise and in its outlook on evil — but it still somehow manages to be fun amid all the carnage.","70","7752126"
"11104","Chomko mitigates a fairly heavy narrative agenda with a great deal of humor, sometimes threatening to make things a little too seriocomic, but never quite crossing the line into pat dramedy.","70","6662736"
"11105","Fortunately for Burton, Big Eyes is actually good. Not great, but good enough -- the perfect middlebrow portrait of the ultimate middlebrow artist.","70","1126590"
"11106","For fans, this is exactly how the story of Jean Valjean's transformation from thief to saint should be delivered: smothered in bombast.","70","1707386"
"11107","So though it takes important steps in that direction, the film pulls back from what seems to be its own logical conclusion.","70","181865"
"11108","The film is in one sense lifelike: in order to get the good, we have to endure the lesser.","70","314331"
"11109","Will Ferrell graduates to his first solo leading role with flying colors in Elf, a disarming holiday comedy about a clueless innocent who saves Christmas and fosters a renewed sense of family in his reluctant father.","70","319343"
"11110","Lipsticked, mascaraed and tilting at a precarious angle (""How do they walk in these things?""), Actor Lemmon digs out most of the laughs in the script. As for Marilyn, she's been trimmer, slimmer and sexier in earlier pictures.","70","53291"
"11111","We've been down this road before. But Pitch Perfect 2, goofier than the original, makes it an enjoyable trip.","70","2848292"
"11112","In her capacity as a film critic — and the sort of populist who was allergic to snobs like Morf — Pauline Kael famously quipped, “Movies are so rarely great art that if we cannot appreciate great trash we have very little reason to be interested in them.” Gilroy doesn’t even aspire to making great art, but he’s getting better at delivering the latter.","70","7043012"
"11113","That American Ultra works as well as it does is a testament to its two lead performances.","70","3316948"
"11114","Once again, though -- almost in spite of Haynes' rigorous post-ironic efforts to bring Sirk back from the dead in any and every way he can -- it ultimately comes down to Moore -- and Moore is simply...wonderful.","70","297884"
"11115","It's no rival for le Carré when it comes to the old cross/double-cross stuff; but a surfeit of style and a tasty supporting turn by James McAvoy help fill the time between fight scenes, which — this being a film by the stuntman/codirector behind John Wick — are pretty much the whole point.","70","2406566"
"11116","The Cincinnati Kid is one of the definitions of what made Steve McQueen who he was. Through the roles he chose, he fit snugly in them, using his calm wits and all else of him to turn himself into the ultimately cool actor.","70","59037"
"11117","Speed Racer creates a timeless, visually seductive world suspended somewhere between the pop '60s and the sci-fi future.","70","811080"
"11118","Surprisingly funny and expectedly rude, this first starring vehicle by vilified standup comic Andrew Dice Clay has a decidedly lowbrow humor that is a sort of modern equivalent of that of the Three Stooges.","70","98987"
"11119","Darabont doesn't match the sly cultural commentary of ""The Host,"" a recent Korean import that also revamped the giant-monster genre, but his grocery-store survival drama, dominated by Marcia Gay Harden as a shrill fundamentalist, serves as a crude but effective allegory for post-9/11 America.","70","884328"
"11120","Despite amply funded f/x, including some spectacular muscle-car stunts, the movie motors to the grindhouse with squealing tires and guitars, gratuitous nudity and gore, and a scantily clad greasy-spoon waitress endearingly played by Amber Heard.","70","1502404"
"11121","An accomplished thriller that's nasty, brutish and relatively short.","70","114369"
"11122","Despite its handsome presentation and cinematic ingenuity, the film never really goes beyond superficial pleasures.","70","993842"
"11123","Just as somber as ""The Good Shepherd,"" the most recent domestic spy drama, but more tightly focused, Breach absorbingly zeroes in on how the FBI nailed the most damaging turncoat in American history.","70","401997"
"11124","It's a smooth, proficient, somewhat languorous thriller, handsomely shot with some showy long takes. It's quite watchable, but the script is clever in a shallow way; the people need more dimensions.","70","38991"
"11125","Squirmingly fun suspenser that brings Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"" into the era of vidcams and cell phones, serving up hearty, youth-skewing portions of PG-13 violence and bikini-bait along the way.","70","486822"
"11126","An Education is perceptive and entertaining, but it doesn’t have the jolting vitality of, say, “Notes on a Scandal,” which dramatized an even more unconventional liaison--older woman, fifteen-year-old boy.","70","1174732"
"11127","Director Jon M. Chu (“Step Up 2: The Streets”) has crafted a broadly appealing charmer in which practically anyone can identify with Wu’s character as she’s whisked into this elite milieu.","70","3104988"
"11128","De Palma actually has the gall to combine the plots from both Vertigo and Rear Window in one big voyeur-fest and pull it off with a certain sly efficiency.","70","86984"
"11129","Writer Neil Tolkin and director Greg Beeman, both in their theatrical feature debuts, and Haim whisk you back to that awful period in your teens when you're finishing up driver education and applying for your first license. They make you remember the shame of having to have your mother chauffeur you, dropping you off a block away from wherever you're going so nobody will know your terrible secret. [06 July 1988, p.4]","70","95519"
"11130","Director Ryuhei Kitamura (Versus) is a bit weak when it comes to storytelling, but there are few who could so enthusiastically stage a butcher fight amid hanging human carcasses in a subway car.","70","805570"
"11131","It's entertaining and stylish, though maybe not quite as serious as it wants to be.","70","68327"
"11132","One of the subtler strengths of Never Look Away is the canny evocation of a war-weary, defeated population who did not experience communism as a revolution but a substitution. The insignia and the catechisms changed, but the underlying attitudes remained grotesquely similar in their callous prioritization of dogma over decency.","70","5311542"
"11133","Like so much of the film it's a daft but not too daft proposition; and what redeems it is that the action sequences are superbly filmed, climaxing with Sheen's bullish entry into the arena at make-or-break time, the crowd singing 'Wild Thing' in clamouring unison.","70","97815"
"11134","Danner makes an elegant, warmly sympathetic heroine in this sometimes broadly played but always tender and appealing effort.","70","3236120"
"11135","Williams, who has comparatively little screen time, has come to act, not to cut comic riffs, and he does so with forceful, ultimately compelling, simplicity. [June 5, 1989]","70","97165"
"11136","Though likely to be variously praised and pilloried as a pro-choice film, Weitz’s film is really a movie about choice in both the specific and the abstract — about the choices we make, for good and for ill, and how we come to feel about them through the prism of time.","70","4270516"
"11137","While visually and aurally stunning, James Gray’s latest film doesn’t explore anything new.","70","2935510"
"11138","Happily, director Peter Medak is aware of the fundamental absurdity of his ghost story. In fact, he's taken considerable care to compensate with virtuoso displays of scenic and atmospheric suggestiveness. The Changeling has a stylistic gusto and polish that were conspicuously missing from The Fog and The Amityville Horror. [28 Mar 1980, p.F1]","70","80516"
"11139","The movie is as insistently bubbly as the Bradys themselves, but it does run out of carbonation before the end. ""Bunch"" fans won't mind a bit, while others will be amused by the juxtaposition of the family's wholesome idyll with the harsher realities of life in the '90s, as evidenced by ""Roseanne,"" ""Married ... With Children"" and ""Grace Under Fire."" [17 Feb 1995, p.F01]","70","112572"
"11140","Baumbach’s film for Netflix is more conventionally conceived than some of his best work but benefits from sterling turns from a wonderful cast, most notably Dustin Hoffman and, no kidding, Adam Sandler.","70","5536736"
"11141","Delivers a thoughtful what-if for the heart as well as the mind.","70","268695"
"11142","No doubt about it: Unlike David Lean's much-loved classic, Cuaron's film is loosely based on Dickens. And that's just fine.","70","119223"
"11143","This ambitious, entertaining movie, which showed at film festivals earlier this year, has been hailed in some quarters as a masterpiece worthy of Arthur Miller's Willy Loman or Sinclair Lewis's George Babbitt. Yet its social comments are stained by condescension, and its uplift is sustained by sentimentality that Mr. Nicholson's prickly Everyman can't conceal.","70","257360"
"11144","Serious comedy, powered by an enthusiastic cast and full of good-natured innuendo, Lisa Cholodenko's The Kids Are All Right gives adolescent coming-of-age and the battle of the sexes a unique twist.","70","842926"
"11145","Overall, it’s a decent shot at a tall target, but real credit is due the lead actors, with Larson expanding beyond the already considerable range she’s previously shown with an exceedingly dimensional performance in a role that calls for running the gamut, and Tremblay always convincing without ever becoming cloying.","70","3170832"
"11146","An RBG biopic shouldn’t be about sizzle and showpersonship, but hard work and determination in the face of rampant, seemingly unremitting sexism, and in that respect, Leder’s film gets its priorities right.","70","4669788"
"11147","Retains enough of Soderbergh's usual indie sensibility to make some sly but contentious points.","70","195685"
"11148","Evil Under the Sun, the latest Agatha Christie whodunit to be given the all-star screen treatment, has nothing but style, but its style goes a long way.","70","83908"
"11149","If you prefer to view dying as a natural part of life, a step in a cycle, this film will feel discordant and perhaps counterproductive. But visually it will certainly stick with you, and your children.","70","3416532"
"11150","Snappy heist film that keeps changing the rules of a mystery so that one is never sure whose hands are at the controls.","70","114814"
"11151","Freaks is not a picture to be easily forgotten.","70","22913"
"11152","A poetic but perplexing tale of a mob moll's redemption.","70","115012"
"11153","Curtis ends up making a virtue out of the narrative’s episodic quality, a tendency that’s been criticized in his previous work; the film, like life, is just one damn thing after another, and that’s really the rather lovely point.","70","2194499"
"11154","As in so many Hollywood spectacles, the message and medium are at hopeless odds... Still, the set-up is arresting, the domestic scenes well observed and acted, and the payoffs involving that Roomba toy excellent. Also, a late-film twist isn't a surprise, exactly, but it is delicious.","70","2184339"
"11155","A crowd-pleasing story that has little to do with the messy complexities of reality.","70","111161"
"11156","Thanks to a compact story and some economical direction, it actually ends up better than it has any right to be.","70","450232"
"11157","The Wife is Close’s film from start to finish, and several of the supporting performances fail to rise to her level, with Pryce and Slater the only ones who manage to impress in her orbit.","70","3750872"
"11158","Mr. Ferrara has his saving graces, too, the chief one being raw talent, which he continues to display while telling even the most far-fetched story.","70","103759"
"11159","It has so many unpredictable spins that what's missing doesn't seem to matter much. The images sing. [10 July 1989]","70","96895"
"11160","Crichton’s films drag in dialog bouts, but triumph when action takes over.","70","79240"
"11161","Best appreciated for its sweet eccentricities (beginning with reggae lover Jack's would-be dreadlocks), optimistic outlook and authentic New York vibe, as much as for its commitment to being exactly what it is: an affectionate homage to working-class underdogs trying to carve out their own little corners of happiness.","70","1278379"
"11162","What seems to start out as a burlesque against the rich -- a satire of class-consciousness -- ends up mutating into something stranger and richer and more ambiguous. [10 Dec 1993, p.F4]","70","108149"
"11163","Back in the director's chair for only the second time, the filmmaker, like his main character, is a little unsteady on his feet. But thanks to his stars, the film - like the book - is a smartly observed study of a troubled teen's first year in high school.","70","1659337"
"11164","This is a pure popcorn picture that benefits heavily from its trio of highly skilled, charismatic leading thesps, an unusual setting that provides plenty of visual stimulation, and a confrontational standoff that actually stems from a legitimately provocative premise.","70","117500"
"11165","It’s both lowdown and effete, a jamboree of whoopee jokes and sick wit.","70","335245"
"11166","If The Return of the King was 2 1/2 hours long, it would have rocked. It would have been better than The Two Towers, which is the best film in the series.","70","167260"
"11167","Beyond his struggles with an unwieldy accent and the screenplay's hokum, Mr. Pitt gives a sincere if labored performance enhanced by a sense of genuine struggle.","70","120102"
"11168","With a razor-sharp script and Jennifer Garner winning laughs in a nice change-of-pace role, this cynically funny and pointedly pertinent not-so-subtle spin on the national battle between right and left wing politics scores lots of comic bullseyes.","70","1349451"
"11169","A funky, fun film version of the famous Marvel superhero concoction, one of the earliest of the revisionist wave of supes and in some ways the most lovable or at least the most knowable.","70","120667"
"11170","It’s a likeable popcorn movie, with some good monster moments, an engaging international cast and Jon Turteltaub helming a family-friendly balance of laughter and mayhem.","70","4779682"
"11171","Howard, and the screenwriter, Akiva Goldsman, have used the book as nothing more than their jumping-off point for an erratic work of fiction that's part mystery thriller and part Hollywood schmaltz.","70","268978"
"11172","Both audacious and unwieldy, exciting and excessive, this dark thriller is too long, too violent and not always convincing. But at the same time, there's no denying that it's onto something, that its savage indictment of the nexus involving media, crime and a voracious public is a cinematic statement difficult to ignore.","70","179626"
"11173","Cinematically, it’s undeniably gripping, a tightly wound contraption of nervous energy, grief, and gore. But it’s in service of a story that’s been told countless times before, and it’s not clear where Ramsay’s usually singular point of view is in play.","70","5742374"
"11174","Strong supporting performances, good locations, and well-staged fights contribute to what is an impressive example of how to assemble this kind of material.","70","73092"
"11175","Near the end, Hill boxes himself into a sentimental corner that takes a little off the film’s edge. But before that, Mid90s bristles with fun, feeling and the exhilaration that comes with risking life’s hairpin turns.","70","5613484"
"11176","Solid and inspiring will do nicely for Christmas, but it ought not to be good enough for the Oscar nominations that will almost certainly rain upon this movie's adequate head.","70","162222"
"11177","The result is truly a family film, not a kiddie time-waster that throws the occasional sop to adults; whether you like or love it is a function of how vividly the material reflects your own childhood fantasies.","70","317705"
"11178","This is the most cheerfully preposterous film of a jaw-dropping summer, which is not to say it's not fun, it's simply orchestrated Looney Tunes.","70","99423"
"11179","At its best, Nightbreed is like a living version of a coffee-table book, with each page filled with tentacled, quilled, or moon-faced monsters.","70","100260"
"11180","It lacks Altman's wisdom, but its sense of humor is corrosive, if dispiriting, and its willingness to show the human animal at his most disgusting has a kind of anti-grandeur to it.","70","147612"
"11181","Mr. Damon’s performance helps keep the movie from sinking under the weight of its artfully constructed horrors.","70","1535108"
"11182","The movie is an arty lark of ambiguous entertainment value, pulsing with melancholy. It's rarely less than interesting visually or tonally, thanks in large part to Korine's prurient sense of humor and the rich location textures and Crayola sweep provided by gifted cinematographer Benoit Debie (""Enter the Void"").","70","2101441"
"11183","Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie brings the popular TV series to the screen with a barrage of spectacular special effects, a slew of fantastic monsters, a ferociously funny villain--and, most important, a refreshing lack of pretentiousness.","70","113820"
"11184","Not that How Do You Know doesn't have its moments of shamelessly entertaining shtick, much of it furnished by Nicholson (watch for a very funny visual gag about his proclivities for much younger women) and by Wilson as Lisa's current squeeze.","70","1341188"
"11185","If Spaceballs disappoints you, it isn't because it's unfunny or not entertaining. Brooks at medium pressure is still more amusing than most movie makers. [25 Jun 1987, p.1]","70","94012"
"11186","Garden State features some wonderful performances, chief among them an engaging, even courageous turn from Natalie Portman.","70","333766"
"11187","With their technical astonishments, Director Henson and Executive Producer Lucas have been faithful to the pioneering Disney spirit. In suggesting the thrilling dilemmas that await a wise child, they have flown worlds beyond Walt. [7 July 1986, p.65]","70","91369"
"11188","The movie is as tawdry as someone else's lingerie, yet not without a certain prurient watchability.","70","120890"
"11189","As played with a melancholy rakishness by the handsomer-than-ever Fiennes, M. Gustave is one of Anderson’s more memorable creations—but he’s stranded in a movie that, for all its gorgeous frills and furbelows... never seemed to me to be quite sure what it was about.","70","2278388"
"11190","Raising Arizona is no big deal, but it has a rambunctious charm. The sunsets look marvelously ultra-vivid, the pain doesn't seem to be dry – it's like opening day of a miniature golf course. [20 Apr 1987, p.81]","70","93822"
"11191","Engrossing if standard-issue prison drama.","70","272020"
"11192","The Thin Man was an entertaining novel, and now it's an entertaining picture.","70","25878"
"11193","The movie is almost devised like a rat-in-maze experiment at the Yale psychology department. Each few minutes some new obstacle comes up for Chris, threatening to obliterate his dreams, at which point the film stands back and watches him improvise brilliantly on the run.","70","454921"
"11194","Awfully funny at times.","70","119528"
"11195","Hot Fuzz is fun, and it's nice to see all the English character actors who aren't busy in Harry Potter films, but it lacks its predecessor's freshness.","70","425112"
"11196","When Sandberg isn’t spinning his wheels in the why, he’s capable of doling out a steady diet of scares.","70","4786282"
"11197","It’s amazing how skilled he (Allen) is in making his old ideas seem fresh, lively, even urgent. His new drama Blue ­Jasmine comes this close to being a wheeze. But he sells it beautifully.","70","2334873"
"11198","It's not perfect, or even close, but it delivers on the promise of J.K. Rowling's novels to a far greater extent.","70","304141"
"11199","Appears strangely dated, and its unspecified location seems existentially hokey.","70","89424"
"11200","In terms of raw wit and fearless satire, the South Park kids put Mike Myers and Adam Sandler to shame.","70","158983"
"11201","There are times when the nonstop visual momentum lends 1917 the feel of a virtual-reality installation, and others when the simulation of raw immediacy slips to reveal the calculated construct underneath.","70","8579674"
"11202","First-time feature director Carter Smith, working with resourceful cinematographer Darius Khondji, pulls off the neat trick of using the wide screen to claustrophobic effect. And the actors give such a convincing display of starvation-fueled fear that they deserve their own private craft-service table.","70","963794"
"11203","Rotoscoping makes certain sense for a film about cognitive dissonance and alternative realities, though both the vocal and gestural performances by Mr. Reeves, Mr. Harrelson and, in particular, the wonderful Mr. Downey make me wish that we were watching them in live action.","70","405296"
"11204","Jones is great in the part, even if this movie doesn't quite prove she should be carrying films on her own, and the actress makes her character's clumsy heartache feel like more than a plot point.","70","1405365"
"11205","The decade has been fondly spoofed in capers like ""The Brady Bunch,"" but Lee's film takes a much more searing, if initially hilarious look at the sexual revolution's migration to a New England suburb and the community's subsequent meltdown. [17 October 1997, p.D6]","70","119349"
"11206","While the film glides from Malcolm's early years as a hustler and petty criminal to his emergence in the Nation of Islam, it plays surprisingly safe as a solidly crafted trawl through the didactic/hagiographic conventions of the mainstream biopic.","70","104797"
"11207","Directed with an odd mix of human compassion and giddy abandon by Stephen Gaghan (“Syriana”), Gold is a lively portrayal of what’s often misidentified as the American Dream, but might be more accurately described as the American Fantasy — where men dream of wealth and success without having to put in the work.","70","1800302"
"11208","Until conventional plot contrivances begin to spoil the fun, The Big Easy is a snappy, sassy battle of the sexes in the guise of a melodrama about police corruption.","70","92654"
"11209","If Amy Pascal loses her job over this, it will be an outrage. The only thing about which we disagree is The Interview. She hated it; I think it’s a blast.","70","2788710"
"11210","This intelligent, affecting work is squishy at the core.","70","116209"
"11211","Early on, writer-director David Michôd serves up ""Trainspotting""-like tricks and narration that is beguiling, if rarely apropos. But the actors are something.","70","1313092"
"11212","At its best it plays like modern-day Marx Brothers in which every single thing that happens makes no sense and serves no purpose and nothing happens for any reason at all. It exists solely to get a laugh, not to make a point.","70","357413"
"11213","Primarily, it's a warm, fuzzy and funny duet between Spacey and Bridges, one that brings to mind the interplay between Spock and Kirk.","70","272152"
"11214","Depp plays multiple versions of Sparrow, who now suffers from a split personality; his shtick is funny, but the players are all upstaged by the astonishing special effects, superior to those of earlier installments in creating a wondrous and menacing world.","70","449088"
"11215","It's a zippy melodrama for small-town America and small-towners at heart: well-executed kitsch for audiences that will still be amused at the notion that the bugs are getting so big, they'll drag us all down.","70","100814"
"11216","Though perhaps lacking in a real sense of dramatic tension; veering towards the schmaltzy at times and needing a far tighter ending, Woman In Gold is still a thoroughly enjoyable story, engagingly told and with a nice line in gentle humour to balance the legal battle structure which can veer to dryness at times.","70","2404425"
"11217","Clearly, these films are the work of people who love animals. More importantly though, going beyond the pat eco-conscious message that every kids’ film has to have, HTTYD2 touches on how complex the emotional bond between a person and an animal can be.","70","1646971"
"11218","The film feels a lot like the Serge Gainsbourg number that Stephanie dances to in the kitchen: jazzy, a little sleazy, and worth a cult following.","70","7040874"
"11219","Thanks to an intelligent script, partly by Lorenzo Semple Jr (Pretty Poison, The Parallax View), the action rarely falters, and at its best the film offers an intriguing slice of neo-Hitchcock.","70","73802"
"11220","A movie that revels in pleasure: the pleasure of fashion, of luxury, of power and ambition. It's also a tremendous pleasure to watch.","70","458352"
"11221","An extremely good-natured, upbeat recounting of the infamous Bobby Riggs-Billie Jean King “man vs. woman” match of 1973.","70","4622512"
"11222","For all its flaws, is an often spooky and imaginative ghost story that contains a genuine creepiness.","70","486051"
"11223","Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark is gateway horror that treats intended audiences to many a scream, pulling no punches nor watering down nightmarish conjurings that remind how healthy fearful emotions can be at any age.","70","3387520"
"11224","It’s in the uncertainties and dissonances of Last Flag Flying that Linklater’s humanism really expresses itself. Three men of vastly different values and temperaments come alive in the shared understanding that their losses were for nothing. And that shared understanding is something.","70","6018306"
"11225","The film is ferociously kinetic and full of visual surprises, though its gut-churning reputation doesn't seem fully deserved: if anything the gore is too picturesque and studied, an abstract decorator's mix of oozing, slimy color, like some exotic species of new-wave interior design.","70","83907"
"11226","Years from now, Team America will better convey the political character of 2004 than a stack of Time magazines. Staying funny helps even more.","70","372588"
"11227","Surprisingly and pleasantly unflashy, a straightforward picture that makes a distinction between classiness and bling.","70","472198"
"11228","Star Kevin Costner and director Clint Eastwood deliver lean, finely chiseled work in A Perfect World, a somber, subtly nuanced study of an escaped con’s complex relationship with an abducted boy that carries a bit too much narrative flab for its own good.","70","107808"
"11229","Although not for the faint of heart, it's a potent -- and very tricky -- treat.","70","245674"
"11230","It's genial, not too frightening and even rather sweet.","70","92112"
"11231","Ocean's Eleven is devoid of morality other than a dedication to honour among thieves; it's consistently funny in a way that invites appreciative smiles rather than loud laughter; it's exciting without bringing disagreeable sweat to the palms; it's engaging, but never does anything as vulgar as taking us out of ourselves.","70","54135"
"11232","A harmless and fun dark comedy that you'll enjoy casually watching from time to time.","70","116365"
"11233","Refreshingly quirky comedy.","70","881891"
"11234","O’Toole is excellent in his best, cleanest performance in years. He smashingly delineates an omnipotent, godlike type whose total control over those around him makes him seem almost unreal.","70","81568"
"11235","Furhman plays pure evil with such supreme calmness that only her eyes shine with madness. Indeed, all of the child actors are superb, especially the expressive Engineer.","70","1148204"
"11236","Often dramatically jumbled and musically muddled - but every time the film seemed ready to tip into awfulness, the sneer on my lips was trumped by the lump in my throat.","70","294870"
"11237","What makes it worth the price of admission is the energetic performance Ford pulls off in the cookie-cutter role of big-city cop.","70","118972"
"11238","A scruffy underdog yarn that will appeal not only to kids but also to their thirty- or fortysomething parents.","70","108037"
"11239","Munich is both astonishing and frustrating. It's not easy to tell how much of the tone comes directly from Spielberg and how much comes from Kushner, who was called in to polish the script after Roth completed it.","70","408306"
"11240","The Last Boy Scout is overwrought, extremely violent, has a relatively unbelievable winding plot, perhaps the foulest mouthed teen ever, tons of low lives everywhere, lots of shots to Willis’ face, and is actually a pretty entertaining effort, an undeniable guilty pleasure.","70","102266"
"11241","In writer-director Rajkumar Hirani's tuneful, enjoyable college comedy, 3 Idiots, Khan plays ""Rancho,"" an engineering student so brilliant that he barely has to break a sweat to place first in his class.","70","1187043"
"11242","Cameron Diaz is sublimely screwy as the single-minded bride determined not to let anything--including the deadly mishaps that keep shrinking the wedding party--spoil her nuptials. [30 November 1998, p. 111]","70","124198"
"11243","Given the temptations to goof it up, Pesci's performance in My Cousin Vinny is something of a triumph. As Vincent Gambini, a swaggering pint-sized New York lawyer who only recently passed the bar on his sixth try, Pesci modulates his usual psycho-nuttiness and gives it some recognizably human, even melancholy, undertones. The movie is a very mixed bag, but it's not quite the dumb fest that the TV spots make it out to be. Pesci gives Vinny's ultimate vindication a note of bittersweet triumph.","70","104952"
"11244","The predictable surface of Say Anything is constantly being cracked by characters who think and talk like real people and by John Cusack's terrifically natural, appealing Lloyd.","70","98258"
"11245","This is a messy movie, sometimes repetitive, sometimes too compressed and allusive. But that's like saying Ty Cobb was not a very good sport -- irrelevant in comparison to the horrific fascination of his story.","70","109450"
"11246","The mood is less angst-ridden than hypercaffeinated, as Scorsese keeps cranking the velocity-bloodbath in the reggae inferno, exploding skyline pietà, climactic white light of redemption.","70","163988"
"11247","Spanish lingo crime meller has a verve and cheekiness that's partly a smart wedding of such influences as Sergio Leone, George Miller and south-of-the-border noir.","70","104815"
"11248","In Black Rain, director Ridley Scott and his team pump in so much pyrotechnic razzle-dazzle that the movie becomes a triumph of matter over mind. It's a blast of pure sensation, shallow but scintillating, like a great rock melody, superbly produced, where the music pumps you up even as the lyrics drag you down.","70","96933"
"11249","What he (Jay Baruchel) brings to She's Out of My League, in addition to the geek and the gawk, is a dash of the debonair, which might seem impossible and yet he does.","70","815236"
"11250","Nearly perfect for what it is.","70","144084"
"11251","If the story seems a little waterlogged, it's still big, loud, and fun to watch.","70","114898"
"11252","The book's creepy premise justifies this modern second look, which proves to be a solid if not earthshaking horror pic built around notably good performances.","70","837563"
"11253","Director Robert Benton allows the cast... to shine, but I was left wondering why such a very literary construction as this needed to be made into a movie.","70","308383"
"11254","If there's one thing going for Last Action Hero, it's the construction of it all. Even if this intermixing of kid fantasy and adult shoot'em-up, Hollywood insider jokes and cheap Arnold puns, doesn't completely bowl you over, it's clever and intriguing.","70","107362"
"11255","Lionel’s mannerisms could have gotten obnoxious in a hurry, but Norton calibrates the performance so that the character remains unpredictable without becoming unbearable.","70","385887"
"11256","The Toy would improve with a little tinkering. Still, it's surefire family fare. [10 Dec 1982, p.23]","70","84809"
"11257","Cumming and Leigh -- bring to their stylish, incisive and compassionate film an immediacy and a bracing snap.","70","254099"
"11258","Is it scary? Not especially. But there are enough gory surprises around every bend to keep you laughing/screaming/cringing.","70","1259521"
"11259","With The Conjuring, [Wan] once more turns the familiar terrifying, making it easy to fear what’s behind that closed door, or under the bed, or just around the corner, making a creaking noise that doesn’t sound quite right.","70","1457767"
"11260","Eventually falls into the same candy-coated trap it's trying to expose. But the fact that a movie can acknowledge the trap exists is a step in the right direction.","70","120789"
"11261","There's some variety to the crimes, as there is to the characters, and an audience is likely to do more screaming at suspenseful moments than at scary ones. The gore, while very explicit and gruesome, won't make you feel as if you're watching major surgery. The direction and camera work are quite competent, and the actors don't look like amateurs.","70","82495"
"11262","The film as a whole isn't quite as interesting, though it is noteworthy that action specialist Emmerich has clearly decided to change course here from anything he's previously made. Although this is primarily a writer's film, with John Orloff's screenplay (and dialogue) placed front and center, Anonymous surprises with how classical, staid and traditional Emmerich's mise-en-scene is, never straying from tried-and-true costumer standards.","70","1521197"
"11263","The movie is so clever and smoothly paced that it's easy to overlook the odious story line.","70","371746"
"11264","Even though Second Act shouldn’t work, it does (sort of). It’s got flow, a certain knowing ticky-tackiness about its own contrivances. You know you’re watching a connect-the-dots comedy, but the dots sparkle. And Lopez gives her first star performance in a while. Age has enriched her talent; she brings curlicues of experience to every scene.","70","2126357"
"11265","A star isn't born in El Cantante as much as it's reconfirmed. She's still here, and she's still got it.","70","458522"
"11266","The virtuosity on display makes the weakness of the story all the more frustrating. I'll avoid spoilers here, but Prometheus kind of spoils itself with twists and reversals that pull the movie away from its lofty, mind-blowing potential.","70","1446714"
"11267","It’s an accomplished and intermittently hypnotic movie. Yet you may feel like you’re occupied more than you are invested.","70","1677720"
"11268","Not everybody will be able to swallow its heady romanticism, yet its French director, Pitof, has brought sophistication to a comic book sensibility, which helps some purple patches of dialogue along with other absurdities.","70","327554"
"11269","Redford, who can’t avoid exuding charisma, plays this role with utter naturalism and lack of histrionics or self-regard.","70","2017038"
"11270","This is, in a way, a real horror film about everyday things and a disconnected family.","70","1242460"
"11271","Harriet is a conscientiously uplifting, devoted, rock-solid version of her story. Yet when it comes to putting the audience in touch with what’s extraordinary about Harriet Tubman — not just illustrating what she did but letting us connect with that quest, and with her, on a moment-to-moment level — Harriet is a conventional and rather prosaic piece of filmmaking.","70","4648786"
"11272","The movie’s arresting visual conceit has enough flexibility to sustain interest, even if the story’s twists and turns sometimes feel excessively fiendish.","70","7668870"
"11273","Steven Soderbergh's direction conjures an understated '70s vibe, striking an apparently effortless balance between grit and glamour.","70","120780"
"11274","What makes The Time Traveler's Wife work as drama, though, and certainly better than it might have, is an unhesitating emotional commitment on the part of the actors (and Schwentke).","70","452694"
"11275","I'm rather intrigued with what Mann does with his stylistic envelope: it's simultaneously hypnotic and enervating, meditative and empty, like a white-noise background or a field of electronic snow on the tube.","70","91474"
"11276","The Omega Man is an extremely literate science-fiction drama starring Charlton Heston as the only survivor of a worldwide bacteriological war, circa 1975. Thrust of the well-written story [adapted from Richard Matheson's novel] is Heston's running battle with deranged survivors headed by Anthony Zerbe.","70","67525"
"11277","Brings back the characters you may have loved, as I did, in the earlier movies: My particular faves are Antonio Banderas' poon-hound Puss-in-Boots.","70","413267"
"11278","A Quiet Place is a tautly original genre-bending exercise, technically sleek and accomplished, with some vivid, scary moments, though it’s a little too in love with the stoned logic of its own premise.","70","6644200"
"11279","It’s an undeniable whopper of a yarn and, coming after a string of middling efforts from Frears, easily the director’s most compulsively watchable picture since “The Queen.""","70","2431286"
"11280","Freeman is so in-tune with the former South African president's persona you can't take your eyes off him.","70","1057500"
"11281","Could call Zemeckis subtle; but his styleWell suits the poem's crude and earthy brawn.Comic-Con geeks and cinephiles alikeWill gape at the resplendent imagery(But don ye specs, and see it in 3-D).","70","442933"
"11282","A sense of injustice runs like a toxic river through Everett’s film, an affront to homophobia through the ages, even our enlightened one. In the end, The Happy Prince makes its strongest mark as a heartfelt salute to Wilde from an actor and filmmaker who was born to play him.","70","2404639"
"11283","Delivers genuine scares.","70","348836"
"11284","Avatar is a technological wonder, 15 years percolating in King Cameron's imagination and inarguably the greatest 3-D cavalry western ever made. Too bad that western is ""Dances With Wolves.""","70","499549"
"11285","All Mission Impossible had to do was not self-destruct. Mission accomplished. Does it ignite? Not really, but Tom Cruise's first adventure as a producer has just enough hightech firepower, old-fashioned star power and a director who knows how to harness it all.","70","117060"
"11286","Ms. Moretz is by far the best thing about the film: she holds the screen as gracefully as she executes a running back flip.","70","1250777"
"11287","Director Doug Liman -- the hip skipper of ""Swingers"" and ""Go"" -- makes all the familiar dirty business seem fun and almost human. In these dog days, Bourne earns what passes as high praise: It doesn't suck.","70","258463"
"11288","The remake is never uninteresting. But it begets the question of whether the slender thread of story about a coven of witches operating out of a famed Berlin dance academy can withstand all the narrative detail, social context and cumbersome subplots heaped onto it.","70","1034415"
"11289","A risky bet that pays off solidly, Jodie Foster's much-delayed The Beaver survives its life/art parallels -- thanks to its star, Mel Gibson -- to deliver a hopeful portrait of mental illness that is quirky, serious and sensitive.","70","1321860"
"11290","Like Kong himself, it's imposing, sometimes endearing, and very rough around the edges.","70","360717"
"11291","The biggest strength of Cradle 2 the Grave is that it doesn’t take itself too seriously.","70","306685"
"11292","A comedy that can't quite support its tragic conclusion, which is too schematic to be honestly moving, but it is acted with such a sense of life that one responds to its demonstration of humanity if not to its programmed metaphors.","70","73486"
"11293","A crowd-pleasing combination of buoyant spirit and occasionally dark humor.","70","845046"
"11294","A wonderful slice of pulp alien-invasion sci-fi with a dash of conspiracy thriller tossed in for good measure. It plays as a clever X-Files knockoff and as a funny camp classic all at the same time. Low budget sci-fi pictures like these are rarely this entertaining, or good for that matter.","70","115571"
"11295","Unlike many other purveyors of hip comedy, they're consistently clever without being contemptuous of their audience.","70","415306"
"11296","The first hour of the film sets up the situation with a naturalistic vigor and cinematic resourcefulness unique to Scorsese. He knows precisely how to move the camera, dress a set, direct his splendid actors, underlay the music, edit to keep the viewer off guard and consistently impressed. But Raging Bull has nowhere to go but down and out. As Jake follows the trajectory of his predictable degradation, the film threatens to become as bloated and repetitious as the fat ex-champ in his cups.","70","81398"
"11297","It is thoughtful, unfashionable, measured, mostly honest, sometimes clumsy or remote, often exciting, occasionally moving and eventually surprising. It's correct.","70","405159"
"11298","Has plenty of dark horror style, but it lacks the weird charm of the 1971 original starring Bruce Davison...It's a nice homage.","70","310357"
"11299","Because it pulls off the tricky feat of combining multiple pre-existing Marvel franchises into a reasonably entertaining and tonally coherent whole, The Avengers will likely be hailed as a kind of thinking fan's superhero film, the way Whedon's recent ""Cabin in the Woods"" functioned as both a horror movie and a critique of same.","70","848228"
"11300","No one does dissolute hubris with as much charm as Grant, and his ebullience is the perfect foil to the misanthropic McCarthy.","70","4595882"
"11301","Besides proving to be a faithful mimic of Craven's filmmaking, Aja pours on the gore. But where Aja's version really leaps beyond Craven's both atmospherically and on the violence scale is in the second hour.","70","454841"
"11302","[The Coens] are therefore entitled to patience, respect and, yes, perhaps a special gratitude for this movie, which never once compromises its fundamentally unpromising yet courageously aspiring nature. [26 Aug 1991]","70","101410"
"11303","Nearly the perfect balance between straight-faced pulp action and amused wonder at the outlandish world of comic books.","70","120903"
"11304","He makes a good job of it, though the wider aspirations to contemporary relevance seem dubious. Stone seeks large lessons in the experiences of ordinary men in battle, but it isn't clear Vietnam has anything new to offer: war is hell and somebody inevitably gets shafted, but the uniqueness of this conflict lies away from the military arena: in politics, psychology, and history. For all the purported naturalism, the film seems resolutely schematic, and the attitudes shaping the drama are far from open-ended.","70","91763"
"11305","As long as The Wizard of Oz sticks to whimsey and magic, it floats in the same rare atmosphere of enchantment that distinguished Walt Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. When it descends to earth it collapses like a scarecrow in a cloudburst.","70","32138"
"11306","Is it a great movie? I don't think so. But it's a triumphant piece of filmmaking -- journalism presented with the brio of drama. [24 Sept 1990]","70","99685"
"11307","Zinging between humor and poignance with a lot of charm, it achieves in its most insightful moments what comedy does best: Let us laugh at the world a little, by way of learning something about ourselves.","70","9484998"
"11308","Death at a Funeral works and then some. The movie is labored, overly familiar and about 10 miles away from deep -- an elemental, sometimes excremental comedy about petty twits behaving badly. As totally unnecessary remakes go, it's one of the best.","70","1321509"
"11309","Like some silly summer song that can't be shaken from the mind, this is a catchy enterprise, no better than it tries to be and no less funny.","70","1386588"
"11310","This complex story from the early days of psychoanalysis engrosses and even amuses as it unfolds through a series of conversations, treatment sessions and exchanged letters.","70","1571222"
"11311","Maybe part of the problem is that black comedy is a tough genre in which to create a masterpiece.","70","477348"
"11312","Waters offers a worldview that's uniquely his own.","70","173716"
"11313","The script does create sufficient tension and intrigue to hook viewers along with a photogenic, hardworking cast.","70","1197624"
"11314","Michael Ritchie's 1985 mystery comedy has the pleasant, modest feel of a Fox B picture from the 30s—a Charlie Chan with a sense of humor... It does make for a decent evening's entertainment.","70","89155"
"11315","The Incredible Hulk is weightless--as disposable as an Xbox game. It's also fairly entertaining: swift, playful without pitching into camp, and acted with high spirits.","70","800080"
"11316","It says something when you come out of a film as weird and fantastical as Oldboy and feel that you've experienced something truly authentic. I just don't know what. I can't think of anything to compare it to.","70","364569"
"11317","Lee and his writers have thrown as many logs on the fire as they’ve been able to find to signal the persistence of racial injustice; they have also endeavored, and mostly succeeded, to entertain.","70","7349662"
"11318","I can't say I remembered this 1995 feature too clearly a couple of days later; but I certainly had a good time as I watched it.","70","114388"
"11319","Upgrade offers memorable, legible fights, a compelling bombed-out retro-apocalyptic look and a mystery that seems obvious at the start but then keeps twisting.","70","6499752"
"11320","As she did in her breakthrough film Winter's Bone, Jennifer Lawrence anchors this futuristic and politicized elaboration of The Most Dangerous Game with impressive gravity and presence, while director Gary Ross gets enough of what matters in the book up on the screen to satisfy its legions of fans worldwide.","70","1392170"
"11321","There is enough enchantment in this big, generous, flawed movie for most everybody. [24 Sep 1984, p.85]","70","86879"
"11322","Schwarzenegger is presented as a lumbering slab of dumb, destructive strength--the image is more geological than human--and Cameron plays his crushing weightiness against the strangely light, almost graceful violence of the gunplay directed against him. The results have the air of a demented ballet.","70","88247"
"11323","The main problem is that Ritchie keeps playing the same old song. It's a swell tune, and we don't mind hearing it every few years, but we'd welcome another subject in a transposed key. Even the Material Girl tries out fresh material.","70","1032755"
"11324","The burden of creative responsibility feels heavier here than in any of the previous installments, ditto the trauma of seeing teenagers get stabbed to death. As a result this is quite effective as horror filmmaking and more pungent than anything he's done in a while.","70","1262416"
"11325","The Lost World is a smoother, scarier ride than its predecessor, with twice as many dinosaurs twice as well designed eating twice as many people...But he's not particularly playful with his terrors here, and that's a disappointment coming from a filmmaker who can mix scares and laughs the way no one else ever has.","70","119567"
"11326","Serves up all the requisite elements with enough self-deprecating humor to suggest it doesn't take itself too seriously.","70","1133985"
"11327","This beautifully designed canine-resurrection saga feels, somewhat fittingly, stitched together from stray narrative parts, but nonetheless evinces a level of discipline and artistic coherence missing from the director's recent live-action efforts.","70","1142977"
"11328","Funny, honest, and generous, this is mainstream American comedy at its best.","70","478311"
"11329","All in all, Frozen River is gripping stuff. Except it's also rigged and cheaply manipulative.","70","978759"
"11330","Wright wouldn't recognize unobtrusive if it tapped him on the nose--he's cross- pollinated the first half of Atonement into an Oscar-buzzy brew of Masterpiece Theatre and ""Upstairs, Downstairs,"" with the wild English countryside tamed into an artfully lit fairy glade, and into just enough of a bodice-ripper to reel in the youth market. And not a bad one at that.","70","783233"
"11331","It's the first stop-motion feature filmed entirely in stereoscopic 3-D, and the technique makes Selick's artwork even more wondrously creepy. The problem is Gaiman's story, which keeps accumulating otherworldly mythology but doesn't establish a clear line of action in the home stretch.","70","327597"
"11332","In the Mouth of Madness has enough menace and novelty to please fans of Mr. Carpenter's horror films (among them The Fog, Christine and Halloween) without the wider interest of an enchanting parable like Starman, which he also directed. Still, this is a film with the temerity to think big, if only for the magnitude of the wickedness it invokes.","70","113409"
"11333","This isn't ""2001,"" by a long shot, but for 2000, it'll do nicely.","70","183523"
"11334","Like much of Bong’s work, Parasite is cumbersomely plotted and heavy-handed in its social commentary. The largely naturalistic treatment here may also alienate some of his fantasy fanboy constituency. That said, this prickly contemporary drama still feels more coherent and tonally assured than Snowpiercer or Okja, and packs a timely punch that will resonate in our financially tough, politically polarized times.","70","6751668"
"11335","Jackson’s film is best enjoyed for the quality of the performances and the typical richness of Hare’s screenplay.","70","4645330"
"11336","It's a deeply divided film--hugely ambitious and uneven, with sequences that seem to point to a new, comically flagrant movie sexuality and others that drag one into the funky muddle of the dreariest dopehead downers from the '70s.","70","118749"
"11337","Legrand's decision to leave things intentionally unclear early on so he can draw the audience into the family’s problems and consider them from various sides finally works against the third act’s cold hard facts.","70","6002232"
"11338","Mr. Aronofsky is a virtuoso of mood and timing, a devoted student of form and technique straining to be a credible visionary. But as wild and provocative as his images can be, there is something missing — an element of strangeness, of difficulty, of the kind of inspiration that overrides mere cleverness.","70","5109784"
"11339","The picture may end a little too breezily, but Demme knows we have to be left with some hope for these wandering souls. Someday, they'll find their way home; it just may not be the same thing as going home.","70","1084950"
"11340","Lots can be said for The Aviator as entertainment, though not much for it as edification.","70","338751"
"11341","Equity is a smart Wall Street thriller which is most engaging when it’s exploring the obstacles facing its female protagonists specifically because of their gender.","70","3958780"
"11342","Though it is difficult to take Unfaithful as seriously as it takes itself, on its own terms it's quite well done.","70","250797"
"11343","Here is ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" inflated to lethal proportion, or ""The War of the Roses"" reimagined as World War III.","70","356910"
"11344","A lot more fun than ""Blair Witch,"" and it's more relaxed and goofy than its two predecessors -- a farcical bloodbath.","70","134084"
"11345","Although the action set pieces are impressive, the exposition is sluggish. For all the posh dollies, high angles, and Venetian-blind crisscross patterns, The Black Dahlia rarely achieves the rhapsodic (let alone the delirious).","70","387877"
"11346","La La Land...reaches for the stars, doesn't quite grab them all, and then is still kind of OK in the end.","70","3783958"
"11347","In Rocky V, the fifth and presumably last episode of Sylvester Stallone's Rocky Balboa saga, the writer-star once again contrives a way to make his hulking, sad-eyed gladiator the underdog. And we get whiffs of funkiness and humanity stirring around for the first time since the original Rocky. [16 Nov 1990, p.1]","70","100507"
"11348","Cretton has made and will make subtler movies, but probably none that will prompt as many mid-screening rounds of applause.","70","4916630"
"11349","Even when caught in a rut, Anderson's obsessive vision still yields many exhilarating surprises.","70","362270"
"11350","Funny, thought-provoking and, yes, touching.","70","191754"
"11351","There is plenty of bang-bang but very little kiss-kiss in Tomorrow Never Dies, a solid but somewhat by-the-numbers entry in the James Bond cycle.","70","120347"
"11352","A lunatic cast energizes this comic fantasy.","70","1231587"
"11353","Although the plot is crucial, it's the interaction among characters that makes Snatch percolate. Ritchie knows when to stop and smell the comedy.","70","208092"
"11354","A fraction less gut-bustingly goofy than its predecessors.","70","1213663"
"11355","As in ""Country Strong,"" Meester's crack timing and irresistible poignancy illuminate a part that would leave other actresses simpering themselves off the screen.","70","1067774"
"11356","No, it's not the final movie in the series, but it's the end of a particular era for Jason, and it's a good way to go out for the hockey masked killer.","70","87298"
"11357","You keep waiting for the movie to clarify, to settle down to its archetypal purity: icon of psychotic evil against icon of neurotic good. Music by Wagner in his ""Götterdämmerung"" mood, screenplay by Nietzsche, with additional lines by Babaloo Mandel. Oh, what a great big movie wallow, what a transformational blast of cine-pleasure. It never quite arrives","70","468569"
"11358","A good movie, atmospheric and sometimes creepy. It grabs us with the premise and holds our attention and doesn’t let go, right up to the explosive climax.","70","278504"
"11359","While hardly as sturdy or provoking an entertainment as North by Northwest, say, it remains an entertainment.","70","56923"
"11360","It all contributes to making the story breathless and nerve-jangling.","70","438488"
"11361","A Nightmare on Elm Street puts more emphasis on bizarre special effects, which aren't at all bad.","70","87800"
"11362","Queen & Slim’s cumulative impact mostly justifies the tonal inconsistencies, leaving the viewer with a troubling look at a society in which the marginalised always feel hunted.","70","8722346"
"11363","Ends up more challenging and intriguing than personally involving, and while these are far from small things, it is only human to hope for more.","70","307479"
"11364","The limitations of Calvary are summed up by the insistent, dialectical chatter that almost mechanically pings and pongs between lightness and darkness, glibness and seriousness, insincerity and honesty, faithfulness and despair.","70","2234003"
"11365","It's beautiful to look at, and yet the story is strangely lacking; the novel's first chapter, available online at author Chevalier's Web site, tchevalier.com, seems to contain more plot points than the entire film.","70","335119"
"11366","Melfi comes up with any number of good and effective scenes and there’s plenty to enjoy in the performances.","70","2170593"
"11367","The movie's revisionist tone is startlingly enough to carry you along.","70","1735898"
"11368","It is a sprawling, ambitious and very long look at so many things, it's almost a miracle he was able to wrap it up in just two hours. And yet, for a film that is principally about death, the conclusion is surprisingly life-affirming, especially coming from Kaufman.","70","383028"
"11369","Just as the “French Extreme” film Martyrs set a new standard for garish sadism, Hereditary raises the bar on emotional agony. If you want to see things you can never un-see and feel pain you can never un-feel, here’s the ultimate test.","70","7784604"
"11370","Howard and Morgan make the journey intense enough to keep audiences guessing up to the finish line.","70","1979320"
"11371","Nothing miraculous, but it's time pretty well spent.","70","195945"
"11372","Even the melodramatic score can't ruin the essentially serious tenor of this old-style non-self-referential horror story, whose characterizations are unassailable--stereotypical shtick you buy because the performers are working so hard and their faces are so skillfully lit.","70","119675"
"11373","The film is never inspired; it's not imaginative enough to be any more than an entertainingly good time. But it's an enormously unassuming, likable comedy, and surprisingly uninsistent for a big summer entertainment.","70","93260"
"11374","Director Phillip Noyce, who made ""Dead Calm,"" ""Patriot Games"" and ""Clear and Present Danger,"" keeps things moving at a kinetic, involving pace. And writers Jonathan Hensleigh (who wrote ""Die Hard With a Vengeance"") and Wesley Strick create a diverting human steeplechase.","70","120053"
"11375","Sylvester Stallone doesn't get back in the ring in Creed, but he still comes away as a big winner in this far-fetched but likeable offshoot of the geriatric Rocky series.","70","3076658"
"11376","The scenes between Pattinson and de Ravin exude genuine charm.","70","1403981"
"11377","Danielle Harris deserves a lot of credit for her work in Halloween 4. It's hard to find truly believable child actors in general, and in the realm of a film like this, it's easy to expect the worst, yet she is very credible and relatable and took an idea that probably had some fans cringing -- a little girl as the hero of a Halloween sequel! -- and made it work.","70","95271"
"11378","Numbing but not boring, it's finally more dispiriting than exhilarating, like a wild night of debauchery that leaves only a fearsome hangover for a souvenir.","70","118880"
"11379","Part of what makes The Parallax View so unnerving is that it also offers no explanation.","70","71970"
"11380","It is ultimately the film's reliance on this thumping action assault that keeps it from true summer-movie greatness.","70","120755"
"11381","Though sporadically brilliant, this too-often uneven send-up of Russian politics attempts to maintain the rapid-fire, semi-improvisational style of Iannucci’s earlier work...while situating such madness within an elaborately costumed and production-designed period milieu.","70","4686844"
"11382","The Village may have finally emptied his usual bag of tricks, but considered on its own merits, its skillful fusion of Grimm fairy-tale horror and pointed social parable find Shyamalan in peak form.","70","368447"
"11383","Subtlety was never Taylor Hackford's long suit, but that's an asset in this mischievously fortissimo poke at lawyering and capitalist competition.","70","118971"
"11384","It's Smith's eccentric oldster who is the film's driving force, and the 80-year-old actress doesn't disappoint.","70","3722070"
"11385","Filthy fun, if not much more.","70","164052"
"11386","Movies about the trajectory from outsider to insider in LA social and professional circles--the two always seem inextricably linked--are a dime a dozen, but this one is fresh, thanks to a script by lead actor Jon Favreau that lets us know Mike knows he resembles a character in a movie even if he doesn't know he is one.","70","117802"
"11387","Ninja isn't a great movie, but if you're in the right frame of mind, it is a bloody good time.","70","1186367"
"11388","The film works by putting the accelerator to the floor and never looking in the rear-view mirror.","70","337921"
"11389","The economy of both script and direction is admirable—there's no wasted motion in sight—though the film's anthology of genre cliches ultimately undermines Bates's heroic efforts to make it something more.","70","100157"
"11390","Intelligent and handsomely mounted, though it doesn't use its length to build to a particularly complex emotional effect. It's a thin, snaky epic with more breadth than body, rather like watching an entire Masterpiece Theatre chapter play in a single sitting.","70","59113"
"11391","Mike Nichols' film of Carrie Fisher's novel Postcards from the edge packs a fair amount of emotional wallop in its dark-hued comic take on a chemically dependent Hollywood mother and daughter (Shirley MacLaine and Meryl Streep).","70","100395"
"11392","When a spectacular film rests on at least a minimal armature of character and cogent action, as Troy does, we can just sink back and enjoy. What we enjoy is the sovereignty over time and place and the force of gravity that film has given to the world.","70","332452"
"11393","Paul Verhoeven, a Dutch director (""Soldier of Orange""), doesn't let the furiously futuristic plot get in the way of the flaming explosions, shattering glass and hurtling bodies.","70","93870"
"11394","A sexless, inhuman film, whose power derives from a ruthless subordination of its content to the demands of telling a good story. A glossy, action-packed ritual which is fun to watch but superficial to think about.","70","66921"
"11395","This British film has the regal, clubby aura of Masterpiece Theatre. [21 July 1997, p. 70]","70","119280"
"11396","Directed by David Slade (""Hard Candy""), the action scenes are artful and terrifying; these killers move so quickly and decisively, there seems to be no hope for humanity.","70","389722"
"11397","In addition to tossing in the occasional spy-movie homage (there's certainly a Hitchcock touch to Mr. Franklin's choice of villains), he has kept the story moving and the actors lively.","70","87065"
"11398","With down-to-earth comic instincts, it simply invests its story with a loud ring of truth.","70","131369"
"11399","Screenwriter Charles Edward Pogue and director Rob Cohen have reasonably literate fun subverting the knight genre. [10 Jun 1996, p.91]","70","116136"
"11400","It is a solid thriller that works best when it is most involved in its adolescent heroes' non-monster-related concerns. It will prove much more satisfying to King's legion of fans than ""Dark Tower"" did. But it falls well short of the King-derived film it clearly wants to evoke, ""Stand By Me""; and newcomers who were spoiled by the eight richly developed hours of Stranger Things may wonder what the big deal is supposed to be.","70","1396484"
"11401","Click manages to sneak some surprisingly moving moments in between the gross-out gags and the schmaltzy resolutions.","70","389860"
"11402","Bill & Ted Face the Music is a pleasant escape for the quarantine-stricken, a sweet and entertaining romp that defies expectations by largely recapturing what worked about the series so many years later.","70","1086064"
"11403","Mr. Lyne's films may not cast any new light on the human condition, but they do keep you glued to the screen.","70","107211"
"11404","An energetic, enjoyably preposterous compound - it's a paranoid thriller blended with pseudo-neuro-science fiction and catalyzed by a jolting dose of satire.","70","1219289"
"11405","A villain will rise, as he must, and the inevitability of that spectacle is the source of this movie’s undeniable power as well as its real limitations.","70","7286456"
"11406","Some of the results ring false, but the memorable theme song and some equally memorable character acting (by Thomas Mitchell and Lon Chaney Jr. more than Lloyd Bridges and Katy Jurado) help things along.","70","44706"
"11407","Near Dark has filmmaking finesse to spare, but puts its dank characters on display rather than cadging sympathy for them. It is the Blue Velvet of date-night spook shows.","70","93605"
"11408","This slight but enormously likable picture seems destined to be an awards magnet.","70","1655442"
"11409","The loudest, flashiest, silliest and longest blockbuster in a summer full of long, silly, flashy, loud blockbusters (long and silly ""Transformers,"" flashy and loud ""Wolverine"").","70","1046173"
"11410","Visually, it's a treat, a perfect marriage of hi-tech graphics and the traditional Disney virtue of strong characterisation and colour. The script crackles with wit and life. Williams' Genie is matched by Freeman's malevolent Jafar, and by Gottfried as Jafar's wisecracking parrot Iago. The only disappointments are the wet Aladdin and his sweetheart Jasmine and five rather ordinary original songs.","70","103639"
"11411","Cube, the story in question, proves surprisingly gripping, in the best ''Twilight Zone'' tradition.","70","123755"
"11412","If you're a fan of provocative, offbeat films such as ""My Own Private Idaho"" or ""The Crying Game,"" you might want to give ""Phillip Morris"" a chance.","70","1045772"
"11413","Edgerton shows an admirable sense of restraint, even when hitting all the usual beats. He includes moments of quiet introspection for the characters and the audience alike.","70","7008872"
"11414","The powerhouse cast is so capable, the actors just about manage to play the picture as if it were a ""Midsummer Night's Dream""-style frothy farce, with marigold garlands and picturesque poverty.","70","1412386"
"11415","Boseman is an empathic presence, and nothing he does smacks of mimicry. He feels Brown from the inside out, the way Brown felt his own distinctive rhythms, and even when the movie itself seems to be on autopilot, Boseman never leaves the captain’s chair.","70","2473602"
"11416","Fried Green Tomatoes is a folksy enigma, an ordinary film blessed with a number of out-of-the-ordinary performances. Not only does its plot deal in part with women stuck in unhappy circumstances, its very existence makes you wonder how its trapped actresses managed to make the best of a dramatically disheartening situation. [27 Dec 1991, p.F1]","70","101921"
"11417","Though marred by Spielberg's usual carelessness with narrative points, the film alternates sweetness and sarcasm with enough rhetorical sophistication to be fairly irresistible.","70","83866"
"11418","It's Tobey Maguire, doing fine, subtle work, who holds it all together -- he puts a human touch to what is otherwise expertly wrought hokum.","70","124315"
"11419","The ultimate touch of ghoulish humor is when we see the bomb actually going off, dropped on some point in Russia, and a jazzy sound track comes in with a cheerful melodic rendition of ""We'll Meet Again Some Sunny Day."" Somehow, to me, it isn't funny. It is malefic and sick.","70","57012"
"11420","Mr. Waters, of course, no longer traffics in the truly vulgar, as he did in early films like Pink Flamingos. With Serial Mom he concocts a cute suburban satire, a warmly funny movie that even a mother could love.","70","111127"
"11421","Manages an impressively huge score in the hit-or-miss gag ratio.","70","175142"
"11422","Giddily recycling everything from “2001: A Space Odyssey” and “The Matrix” to yakuza actioners and National Geographic documentaries, it’s a garish, trippy, wildly uneven and finally quite disarming piece of work, graced by a moment-to-moment unpredictability.","70","2872732"
"11423","Unlike this year's earlier Tibetan-themed biopic, ""Seven Years in Tibet"", Martin Scorsese's quietly devastating film really IS about the Dalai Lama.","70","119485"
"11424","Without a doubt, making the most substantial impact is Thurman. While she has proven her versatility over the years, her work as The Bride shows that her talent is matched by her fearlessness.","70","266697"
"11425","It may be long, but it's not boring -- how could it be when jack o' lanterns float lazily overhead in the dining hall, and the venerable Maggie Smith turns into a cat?","70","241527"
"11426","In its purposeful accumulation of depravities, both individual and institutional, the director's non-style has an honorable payoff that's rare in modern Hollywood cinema: the story's weight could come close to burying you in despair.","70","824747"
"11427","Always commanding attention at the film’s center is Pearce, who, under a taciturn demeanor, gives Eric all the cold-hearted remorselessness of a classic Western or film noir anti-hero who refuses to die before exacting vengeance for an unpardonable crime.","70","2345737"
"11428","A viewer's patience with some of Safety's more rote stretches is rewarded in the film's final 15 minutes, when the plot takes a truly unexpected turn. As a DIY answer to the Spielberg generation's nostalgia for movie magic, the film's fully earnest, fantastic climax beats something like ""Super 8"" at its own game for a fraction of the cost.","70","1862079"
"11429","What's confusing yet ultimately illuminating is the way his gremlins function as a free-floating metaphor, suggesting at separate junctures everything from teenagers to blacks to various Freudian suppressions.","70","87363"
"11430","A movie you can't readily get out of your head.","70","203009"
"11431","You don't feel bamboozled, fooled, or patronized by District 9, as you did by most of the summer blockbusters. You feel winded, and shaken, and shamed. [September 14, 2009, pg.115]","70","1136608"
"11432","Unfortunately, even that mastery is not enough to overcome one major fault, for the plain fact is that the film’s first half is too slow and too long.","70","52357"
"11433","It matters because this boxer taps into something deeper in our collective souls than the desire for entertainment. It's the hope that one day we're going to win big, too, after everyone's given up on us. It's as hokey as it's true.","70","479143"
"11434","Dunkirk would have been even better, though, if any of the characters seemed as fully realized as the aerial and naval warfare. Without that, it works best as pure sensory experience; incredible visuals, intense battles. In the rare quiet moments, we’re invited to observe an unusual instrument featured in Hans Zimmer’s score: The ticking of a clock, a reminder that while Nolan can change the march of time, his heroes cannot.","70","5013056"
"11435","It is, in short, a city that only the Mouse House could imagine, and one that lends itself surprisingly well to a classic L.A.-style detective story, a la “The Big Lebowski” or “Inherent Vice,” yielding an adult-friendly whodunit with a chipper “you can do it!” message for the cubs.","70","2948356"
"11436","A black waitress and a white corrections officer in rural Georgia experience more misery in the first hour of this movie than some people do in a lifetime, and to its credit the drama doesn’t collapse under the weight.","70","285742"
"11437","The story (what there is of it) doesn't make much sense, but this is a very scary horror thriller that should keep you either on the edge of your seat or halfway under it.","70","263488"
"11438","Offers up the kind of pleasures that only a summer movie can...The cast is good-looking, the soundtrack is loud, the plot is stupid.","70","257076"
"11439","Stargate is a blast from the past in many ways, but it imaginatively employs the latest special effects technology to give audiences new thrills. [24 Oct 1994]","70","111282"
"11440","The film is only ""superior"" though, not great. The themes feel shopworn and devotee of crime fiction can point to the any number of antecedents for these characters.","70","1189340"
"11441","Unquestionably too long, and lacking the snap and audaciousness of the pictures that made him the talk of the town, this narratively faithful but conceptually imaginative adaptation of Elmore Leonard's novel ""Rum Punch"" nonetheless offers an abundance of pleasures, especially in the realm of characterization and atmosphere.","70","119396"
"11442","Butler called it ""John Carpenter meets John Hughes,"" and that does just about sum ParaNorman up, though the actual math still feels a little fuzzy.","70","1623288"
"11443","It Follows is remarkably effective for most of its running time, ratcheting up the tension, then stinging the audience periodically with one of those jolts that sends everyone levitating a couple inches above their seats. But the excitement wears off after a point.","70","3235888"
"11444","Familiarity and continuity are what the success of this series has always been about. We've been here before, and we like the neighborhood.","70","253754"
"11445","May have said more about race in America today than any other movie of last year.","70","366551"
"11446","Superman is good, clean, simple-minded fun, though it's a movie whose limited appeal is built in.","70","78346"
"11447","As family viewing, it's pleasant enough: primitive, yes, but in a digitally sophisticated way that's boisterous, funny and will no doubt sell a lot of toys.","70","481499"
"11448","The morbid tone of the original has given way to horror comedy set off by quite spectacular and imaginative fantasy sequences. Dream Warriors is no less grisly, but at least you can laugh at it.","70","93629"
"11449","At its best when the characters sit around, dither, and ruminate. Moviemaking seems to have become almost magically easy for this independent writer-director. He builds a detailed atmosphere, brings his good people and his bad together, and lets them jabber at one another; the virtuosity is rhetorical rather than visual.","70","829193"
"11450","In trying through incessant narration to make a six-year-old a prolix sage, Zeitlin can't avoid falling into sticky sentimentality.","70","2125435"
"11451","The picture gets to you more through its intensity than its craft, but Hooper does have a talent.","70","72271"
"11452","The chief pleasure in the picture (set in Los Angeles) is in watching Hopkins spin off another of his nutty self-possessed intellectual criminals--this time it's Hannibal Lecter lite.","70","488120"
"11453","Shows a rather arrogant disdain for its audience in between occasional flashes of flair.","70","289043"
"11454","It's a terrific piece of junk: the top-notch screenwriters (Stirling Silliphant and Wendell Mayes) never let a cliché slip through the net, and Neame's anaemic direction ensures that every absurdity is treated at face value.","70","69113"
"11455","McGrath says that he considers his film to be lighter in tone than TC 1, which is baffling. The reverse seems the case.","70","420609"
"11456","Eastwood is in good, sly form, once again delighting in a character's splendid solitude and singular skill at what he does.","70","118548"
"11457","The picture is worth catching for the delicate and toxic nuances of Rudd's performance. And one of its funniest corollaries is that it shows how hilarious and instructive a star this perennial supporting player can be.","70","1155056"
"11458","There’s an unmistakable, scathing sense of outrage behind the whole endeavor, and it’s impossible not to admire McKay’s reckless willingness to do everything short of jumping through flaming hoops on a motorcycle while reading aloud from Keynes if that’s what it takes to get people to finally pay attention.","70","1596363"
"11459","If it’s less punchy and original than “(500) Days of Summer,” it’s still a wry tale that deserves to be seen. Gerald keeps telling Thomas that life should be a mess, but in The Only Living Boy in New York it’s a pleasingly witty and well-observed one.","70","460890"
"11460","The killing is bloody, the power struggles involving, the history-class examinations of the relations between mines and unions and gangsters fascinating, and the tough-guy routines, while sometimes tiresome, never less than credible.","70","1954470"
"11461","Gussied up with a host of filmmaking tricks in an attempt to keep things lively, this intensely acted little exercise just doesn't have enough going for it, with the exception of gradually growing interest in lead Colin Farrell.","70","183649"
"11462","To give the film its due, the direction is expert, the writing is shrewd, the cinematography is stylish, and the performances are extraordinary... Hard Candy is also sadistic in its own right, relentlessly ugly, entirely heartless and eventually unendurable. It's torture.","70","424136"
"11463","Ridley Scott's A Good Year is a bonbon made by a mechanic, a well-intentioned diversion put together by someone who clumsily adds the right ingredients in the wrong proportions at the wrong time. But sometimes, if you get the sugar level close to right, you can do OK, and A Good Year offers some pretty basic pleasures that movies often fail to give us these days.","70","401445"
"11464","While compromised by the uplift and affirmation that mainstream animation regurgitates like a mommy penguin, it also shows a remarkable persistence of vision. Even in a story about singing-and-dancing fat and feather, Mr. Miller can’t help but go dark and deep.","70","366548"
"11465","Beneath all The Double’s cynicism, misanthropy, intense stylization, and distance lies a core of genuine tragedy, and that’s what gives the film an emotional resonance beyond its aesthetic achievements.","70","1825157"
"11466","It's a terrific performance-and terrifying. Owen Wilson is aging: Where goeth my own youth?","70","480687"
"11467","A pedagogical tone, reminiscent of the 30s, is maintained throughout much of the movie: these strikers are always teaching each other little constructive lessons, and their dialogue is blown up to the rank of folk wisdom.","70","47443"
"11468","It's not a great movie by any means, but it grips tighter than a chokehold and it cuts as deep as a knife.","70","120681"
"11469","Edward Norton makes an art of self-containment. No contemporary actor gives less away to more effect, and he's at his closely held best in 25th Hour, a drama of redemption, directed by Spike Lee, that seldom rises to the level of his performance.","70","307901"
"11470","This is a gangly, confusing sprawl, and yet there are enough patches of beauty scattered throughout that it's impossible to reject it wholesale.","70","373889"
"11471","Even in its rougher patches, The Spectacular Now has a disarming earnestness that keeps it on the level, helped along by two superb lead performances that add up to more than their sum.","70","1714206"
"11472","A compendium of bedside erotica. I don't know when I've seen a mainstream movie that so explicitly caters to the S&M niche. And the chemistry of the central couple, which seemed destined to bring the movie down, is instead the hottest thing in this effects-laden but ultimately empty film.","70","493464"
"11473","Washington's stoic persona here conceals a volcanic rage, and the cast of pros--including Giancarlo Giannini, Mickey Rourke and Rachel Ticotin--support him with relish.","70","328107"
"11474","You have to give credit to Frailty for jiggering up the formula a bit, so that what starts as an ominously low-key study of a boy coming of age with a mad father escalates into a combination of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""Breaking the Waves"" -- Grand Guignol religiosity.","70","264616"
"11475","This dynamically acted, unapologetically contrived pic reps the filmmaker’s best chance to date of connecting with a wider audience — one likely to share the helmer’s bristling anger over corruptly maintained class divides in modern-day America.","70","2891174"
"11476","Sargent's whole enterprise doubles as a '70s archaeological dig.","70","72251"
"11477","Unlike the original, Hannibal may make us hide our eyes, but it doesn't get inside our heads.","70","212985"
"11478","The candlelight flickers exquisitely even as the passions are slow to ignite in this spare, shrewdly acted but not especially vital retelling of Jane Eyre.","70","1229822"
"11479","Sausage Party is something far short of Shavian in terms of sophisticated dialogue — really, there is just so much novelty value one can milk from repetitious fusillades of F-bombs launched by animated characters — but it is difficult to deny the hilarity quotient of a movie so exuberantly and unapologetically rude and crude.","70","1700841"
"11480","This movie has two big things going for it—the dragon and the man who masterminds its slaying.","70","82288"
"11481","The tony cast emotes like mad, but polished Brits are so temperamentally unlike Russians that every four-syllable patronymic sounds like iambic pentameter.","70","824758"
"11482","It's still possible to have a good time at this movie, and the primary reason is De Niro.","70","122933"
"11483","One of the most consistently amusing ways in which it frustrates audience expectations has to do with how amazingly little of this very violent cast of characters' violence actually ends up being expressed onscreen.","70","120735"
"11484","Yet he just kept going and going, and the slick, proficient Knight and Day is proof that you should never count Cruise out.","70","1013743"
"11485","Pic is most exciting as a visual experience, as Walter Hill once again proves himself a consummate filmmaker with a great talent for mood, composition and action choreography.","70","83111"
"11486","Once the premise had been established and the leads began to interact, I stopped totting up the inanities and had a good time.","70","163187"
"11487","As smart as it is, Pi is awfully hard to watch. Filmed with hand-held cameras in splotchy black-and-white and crudely edited, it has the style and attitude of a no-budget midnight movie.","70","138704"
"11488","Director Peter Berg cannily hypes the tension and the sentiment in the only one of the current Middle East political movies designed to appeal to the action crowd. Hard truths are absorbed while stuff blows up.","70","431197"
"11489","If you're looking for satisfying junk food, Executive Decision is exactly the carryout you've been craving. This hijacking suspense drama steals shamelessly from Tom Clancy's kitchen, but it's tautly scripted, loaded with tension and interspersed with great comic relief.","70","116253"
"11490","The surprisingly witty script was worked on by a squadron of writers, including Robert Towne.","70","120591"
"11491","Squeamish types may balk, but the gory cruelty on display here is faithful to the source material and deeply thrilling.","70","816462"
"11492","Slither is a gross, disgusting, but undeniably amusing treat laden with homages and in-jokes.","70","439815"
"11493","48Hrs. is a very efficient action entertainment which serves as a showy motion picture debut for Eddie Murphy.","70","83511"
"11494","The result is an unorthodox blend of courtroom drama and old-style weepie, and somehow it comes off. [23 Dec 1993]","70","107818"
"11495","Anybody hoping that The End of the Tour would mirror the formal dazzle of Wallace’s fiction, doubling back on itself like the frantically probing encounters in his 1999 collection, “Brief Interviews with Hideous Men,” will be disappointed. Yet the film, despite its flatness, is worth exploring.","70","3416744"
"11496","This is a film that transcends ""good"" or ""bad,"" ""like"" or ""don't like.""","70","472181"
"11497","Their downward spiral is like a slow-motion highway pileup: You might think you don't want to watch, but you can't tear your eyes away.","70","120324"
"11498","Smokey and the Bandit is an unexpected good time, a playful, wisecracking and curiously revealing example of All-American escapist entertainment. [29 July 1977, p.B1]","70","76729"
"11499","As a forthright exercise in cumulative terror Cape Fear is a competent and visually polished entry.","70","55824"
"11500","Once again, the Coens' tale of the damned is damn funny.","70","1019452"
"11501","It's tough, astringent, darkly funny and . . . well, it's also generic, untidy, condescending and mild of impact rather than stunning.","70","279113"
"11502","Mr. Garland likes to play with tones, mixing deadpan in with the frights, and later “Annihilation” becomes something of a head movie, swirling with cosmic and menacingly lysergic visions. He keeps the tension torqued throughout this phantasmagoric interlude, sustaining the shivery unease that is one of this movie’s deeper satisfactions.","70","2798920"
"11503","Highbrow campus-comedy from long-lost Whit Stillman is a flawed but frequently hilarious comeback.","70","1667307"
"11504","The comedy in Alfie is plentiful but bittersweet, and the character's bad behavior pleases more than it repels, principally because the star Jude Law's beauty and easy charm go a long way to softening the edges.","70","375173"
"11505","It's a strange, hypnotic, completely fresh vision, not of the future per se, but into Terry Gilliam's own mind.","70","88846"
"11506","The movie is full of vine-swinging, bow-and-arrow-shooting, ancient-spirit-meeting action, but most of it is staged on a convincing human scale, one that’s been expertly tailored to its star’s understated directness.","70","1365519"
"11507","The Company Men is maybe best understood as a chick flick about dicks: Before its too-easy conclusion, the movie offers a multifaceted glimpse at what can happen when the connective tissue between a man and his source of income is cut, and rarely suggests that it could be anything less than excruciating to stop the bleeding.","70","1172991"
"11508","If it is never really as profound as it seems to think it is, American Beauty is consistently entertaining, and it earns points simply for acknowledging that all may not be perfect in the current boom years.","70","169547"
"11509","Directed with an assured sense of style that pushes against the narrow confines of its admittedly fascinating story, John Krokidas’ first feature feels adventurous yet somewhat hemmed-in.","70","1311071"
"11510","With the help of his stunt and special effects teams, Harlin delivers more than enough goods to satisfy genre fans, so main question is whether a female action hero, and Davis in particular, is ready to be embraced by the huge public the film is clearly targeting.","70","116908"
"11511","The Mask Of Zorro is disarming for the same reasons, coasting on the charisma of its stars and a few exciting action setpieces.","70","120746"
"11512","The Love Witch is a seductive 60s time-capsule that calls back to the technicolor charms of early genre filmmaking.","70","3908142"
"11513","Somehow, in accentuating Wiseau’s weirdness, Franco overlooks his soul.","70","3521126"
"11514","Most good films rely on their audiences to connect the dots a little, but Happy End is all dots, with none of the lines drawn in at all. The meaning is there, but you have to dig for it in the everyday events of a family’s life.","70","5304464"
"11515","Stunning, and it has the added bonus of being about an era that is virtually new to movies. As a dramatic achievement, however, it is not quite so amazing.","70","217505"
"11516","Without being any sort of miracle, this is an engaging and lively exploitation fantasy-thriller about computer hackers, anarchistic in spirit, that succeeds at just about everything ""The Net"" failed to--especially in representing computer operations with some visual flair.","70","113243"
"11517","Joel Schumacher, director and ringmaster, piles on the flashy showmanship and keeps the film as big, bold, noisy and mindlessly overwhelming as possible.","70","118688"
"11518","The director (Hallstrom) and cast are all excellent.","70","241303"
"11519","A 157-minute holding pattern in which neither of the ongoing stories--Harry's conflict with the evil sorcerer Voldemort, the young schoolmates' coming of age at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft--progresses much.","70","330373"
"11520","For longtime Wiig fans, this uneven, overlong, emotionally involving and discreetly ambitious film will represent a welcome and overdue step up from her popular sketch work on ""Saturday Night Live"" to something sustained and searching, not to mention pretty funny.","70","1478338"
"11521","The result is a step toward multiculturalism and ecological correctness, though not without a certain amount of confusion. The movie is not quite as entertaining as The Little Mermaid or Beauty and the Beast.","70","110357"
"11522","Director Martin Brest has allowed the actors to improvise, and their resulting interaction is more realistic, funny, and surprising than that of any buddy film released in the last several years.","70","95631"
"11523","Jarhead does feature stunning visuals. Mendes and cinematographer Roger Deakins have created some fantastic imagery.","70","418763"
"11524","Expertly done, and a real joy to watch.","70","120910"
"11525","A fairly standard exercise in claustrophobic menace. It is also an exercise in style.","70","258000"
"11526","A film more moving than most but not as devastating as it should be.","70","1334260"
"11527","Now and then, Lelio departs into reverie and daydream, and it’s here, loosening the bonds of his naturalistic style, that he draws us closer to the mystery of Marina.","70","5639354"
"11528","Set against this is the blithe humour of the proceedings, a welcome shortage of love interest, Dolph's minimalist wit, and two arch-villainesses attired in black plastic and other form-fitting fabrics. Destructive, reprehensible, and marvellous fun.","70","98141"
"11529","It's a comical sentimental reworking of the journey of the Magi, with John Wayne, Pedro Armendariz and Harry Carey Jr as the soft-hearted outlaws. [01 Mar 2008, p.53]","70","40064"
"11530","The movie is best seen as straightforward, sometimes harrowing melodrama, packed with mistaken identities, beautiful villains, a kindly tourist who can outrace the bad guys, and a lost little girl whom the film brazenly sends onto a highway full of speeding cars. It's as if Dakota Fanning had wandered onto the streets of Ronin.","70","443274"
"11531","Inexplicable as it is, the Joan of Arc story encourages contemplation of ourselves as a species. The Messenger is more apt to prompt meditation on the nature of show business.","70","151137"
"11532","Cianfrance generally shows again that he knows how to build immersive characterizations with his actors. And while this sorrowful triptych is uneven and perhaps overly ambitious, the director displays a cool mastery of atmospherics and tone.","70","1817273"
"11533","I love it, but much in the way I managed to love ""The Phantom Menace"" -- in spite of its bloat, swaggering self-importance and largely neutered characters.","70","325980"
"11534","This directing debut for co-writers Rogen and Evan Goldberg offsets its slightly smug premise with a clever sense of self-parody and near-cataclysmic levels of vulgarity.","70","1245492"
"11535","The reason to look past the movie’s issues is Fassbender.","70","2316204"
"11536","It’s shot through with sadness and beauty, with dry humor, with the certainty that even things meant to last forever actually don’t.","70","1714915"
"11537","It's crude, sexist, ear-splittingly loud and a helluva lotta fun for anyone suffering from past or present testosterone overload.","70","165710"
"11538","With it's many knotty connections and complex exposition, the movie is definitely something of a muddle, but for that matter so are most conspiracy theories.","70","118883"
"11539","This is the work of professionals acknowledging a good story and knowing better than to get in the way.","70","325805"
"11540","Over-production-designed as the film is, Bening and Bell manage to hold their own within it.","70","5711148"
"11541","An overlong adventure enlivened by wonders.","70","903624"
"11542","I enjoyed the film as far is it goes, especially John C. Reilly’s straight-shooter performance, yet I also found myself, at certain points, growing impatient with it.","70","4971344"
"11543","A shameless but exuberantly well-done caper comedy.","70","471042"
"11544","This isn't Sheridan's most complex or richest picture, but there's lots of life to it: This is an unapologetically glossy pop product, powered by a strong, old-fashioned sense of B-movie melodrama.","70","430308"
"11545","Honey Boy is not a self-justifying cri de coeur or a prankish exercise in narcissism, but a sensitive, sincere portrait of a child actor's dysfunctional upbringing and its devastating fallout.","70","8151874"
"11546","The effects are magnificent (the tripod drones and the supreme Martian intelligence are horrific), but whereas the original worked by building up an increasingly black mood, this version relies almost entirely on the special effects; and such limited brooding tension as it has is gratuitously undermined by a string of sequences played purely for laughs...Fun, but very silly.","70","91276"
"11547","The movie's pageantry and visual grandeur are its most impressive elements, along with Depardieu's command as Columbus. [09 Oct 1992, p.20]","70","103594"
"11548","While Driver and Seyfried are both quite good, there’s nothing specific enough about their characters to avoid making the film feel like a blanket condemnation of a whole generation and their new ways of doing things.","70","1791682"
"11549","Maybe there will be an oversaturation of ''Scream''-inspired horror films someday soon, but this one feels fresh.","70","146336"
"11550","Leviathan is Alien under water. It's not nearly as sophisticated or as terrifying as the Ridley Scott film, but it looks good and moves fast. It's elementary fun with a couple of scary moments along the way.","70","97737"
"11551","Occasionally a movie's subject outweighs any aesthetic flaws, as it does in this unsettling thriller about the extraordinary rendition of terror suspects.","70","804522"
"11552","Even though Redford, as an ex-rodeo champ, and Fonda don’t create the romantic sparks that might be expected, it’s their dramatic professionalism that salvages Horseman and makes it a moving and effective film by the time the final credits roll by.","70","79100"
"11553","As with all comics-based extravaganzas, brevity is anathema to the Patty Jenkins-directed Wonder Woman, and it doesn’t quite transcend the traits of franchise product as it checks off the list of action-fantasy requisites.","70","451279"
"11554","It’s sloppy and slippery, but for a $5 million movie, it’s remarkable.","70","81633"
"11555","This is a big, often quite scary action movie, with tons of creepy computer-generated imagery that's right up there with Voldemort in terms of physical nastiness, although less powerful emotionally.","70","814255"
"11556","All the kids are believable and Suburbia's shortcomings are mostly in its script, not in its characterizations. [11 Feb 1984, p.G1]","70","86589"
"11557","Weird, wild and way-too-long.","70","3460252"
"11558","Fine performances from a cast of pros generally win out over the story's more formulaic aspects.","70","5816682"
"11559","The movie is wry, touching and fun to sit through, thanks to Rosenberg's amusing script, Ted Demme's vital direction and zesty performances from everyone.","70","115639"
"11560","Yet for all the enjoyable flourishes, and there are many, Ephron keeps pausing to remind us, through various contrivances, that this is a movie, making it hard for anyone to really get lost in the story.","70","108160"
"11561","Deep Impact confines much of its horror to television news reports and has a more brooding, thoughtful tone than this genre usually calls for.","70","120647"
"11562","The movie deserves -- and is likely to win -- a devoted cult following, despite its flaws.","70","1131734"
"11563","The acting is unquestionably strong, the songs are integrated appropriately (functioning as both audio bridges and dramatic enhancements), and yet something is missing in how the individual pieces of the film--the story, the themes, and the violence--fit together.","70","765429"
"11564","Misanthropic, indeed, but the black humour and general inventiveness place it high above most contemporary horror pictures.","70","73705"
"11565","Like it or hate it, Titanic lives and breathes as a piece of pure cinema.","70","120338"
"11566","Under the perfectly paced direction of Ry Russo-Young (“Before I Fall”), Shahidi and Melton develop an easy chemistry on the way toward a satisfying denouement that’s neither tear-jerking tragedy nor fairy-tale wish fulfillment.","70","6423362"
"11567","The Jerk is a kind of post-psychedelic Jerry Lewis movie -- Broad, dirty and juvenile, but definitely hip to its own dumbness. Half the jokes fall flat on their face, but when they score they're laugh-out-loud funny. Almost invariably, the best routines are non sequiturs -- off-the-wall riffs where Martin fixates with dopey brilliance on a subject that has nothing to do with the plot. [17 Dec 1979]","70","79367"
"11568","Fine lowbrow entertainment, a fast, funny pastiche of science-fiction, horror, and teen-movie archetypes that is, aside from the original Scream, perhaps the most entertaining, fully realized film of the current postmodern horror/sci-fi cycle.","70","133751"
"11569","A little on the bland side in its two leads, though suave Kruger and sweaty Lloyd compensate with their vivid villainies. Lots of echoes of earlier British Hitchcock, plus the charmingly bizarre encounter with the caravan-load of circus freaks, the charity ball from which there appears to be no exit, and the classic climax atop the Statue of Liberty.","70","35279"
"11570","If you're in the mood for loud, fast-moving action trash, The Corruptor is waiting to meet you in a dark alley.","70","142192"
"11571","Careens from decade to decade, and from relative dramatic realism to frequent hilarity, in often-winning fashion.","70","123964"
"11572","Once you see that ape, named Caesar, riding a galloping horse in triumph, it's awfully hard not to get sucked in. It's not dumb fun, exactly. It's smart dumb fun.","70","1318514"
"11573","Mr. Rock has not only done his best work as a director and screenwriter but has also made an unusually insightful and funny mainstream American movie about the predicaments of modern marriage.","70","770772"
"11574","Pairing some of the spirit of schlocky Nazisploitation fare with a top-flight young cast and better-than-solid filmmaking, the movie is more mainstream that the midnight fare it sounds like on paper, if only by a bit. Horror fans should cheer.","70","4530422"
"11575","Though ""Romy and Michelle"" doing Tucson doesn't take us much further than Beavis and Butt-head doing America, the ride, and the company, are a lot more fun.","70","120032"
"11576","Director Francis Lawrence drains the pleasure out of seeing a pretty girl in her panties. He refuses to let us leer at Jennifer Lawrence’s long legs without a jab of shame. What’s left is cold and perverse, heat provided only by the satisfying ways Dominika out-thinks the creeps while pretending to be their “magic pussy.”","70","2873282"
"11577","A flat-out celebration of stupidity, bodily functions and pratfalls. Yet the wholeheartedness of this descent into crude and rude humor is so good-natured and precise that it's hard not to partake in the guilty pleasures of the exercise.","70","109686"
"11578","The project lacks the variety of sensuous pleasures that a great movie has to provide.","70","498380"
"11579","Fortunately, both the film’s gorgeous look and its meticulously choreographed action sequences keep us more than occupied until the plot pieces fall into place.","70","6864046"
"11580","The pressure cooker plot calls for intense performances all around but first among equals are Winslet and Ehle.","70","1598778"
"11581","Car Wash uses gritty humor to polish clean the souls of a lot of likeable street people.","70","74281"
"11582","Perhaps we are near to cliche here. Yet the film never really tips over into bathos and predictability. Emilio Estevez, Anthony Michael Hall, Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald and Ally Sheedy are the students, each giving the sort of performance that heralds considerable talent. The film will undoubtedly speak to those at whom it is aimed, and I hope others too. It isn't that wonderful. But it's much, much better than usual.[16 June 1985, p.20]","70","88847"
"11583","Entertaining and slight, topical and cannily familiar.","70","139239"
"11584","The first act is a thing of beauty and the second, good enough. Shame about that third act, though, and the ending that retroactively diminishes everything that preceded it.","70","2080374"
"11585","It’s not just vérité--it’s battlefield vérité; it triggers your fight-or-flight instincts.","70","440963"
"11586","The message is not very different from that of Hello, Dolly! or Mame, but Harold's flaccid asexuality (he's like a sickly infant, a limp, earthbound Peter Pan) and Maude's advanced stage of pixiness give that message a special freaky quality. And the film has been made with considerable wit and skill.","70","67185"
"11587","Though the picture by no means endorses drugs, and paints the junkie life as almost intolerably dull as well as destructive, it is a welcome relief from the mostly heavy-handed Hollywood pictures that tackle the subject. [05 Oct 1989]","70","97240"
"11588","Beautifully edited by Soderbergh, the film is evenly paced, its subtleties accreting slowly, and by the end it gathers powerful emotional momentum.","70","98724"
"11589","Birdman is a marvelously entertaining picture, a work of ""look at me!"" bravado that's energized every minute. Its proficiency, the mechanically fluid kind, works against it in some ways.","70","2562232"
"11590","More smile-inducing than laugh-aloud funny.","70","371724"
"11591","It's one heck of a fun ride, a pure popcorn spectacle that doesn't require a knowledge of the Star Trek mythology to make it enjoyable.","70","796366"
"11592","An E.T. spin-off, but it's a very likable and imaginative one.","70","129167"
"11593","Entertaining in a glossy, mindless way.","70","988045"
"11594","While the new edition doesn’t quite catch that inspired spark, there’s still plenty to enjoy here courtesy of those zippy visuals and a pitch-perfect voice cast led by the innately animated Steve Carell.","70","1690953"
"11595","Exactly what it sounds like: a cowboy movie and an alien movie thrown together, a genre mash-up that's more fun than good, but pretty good nonetheless.","70","409847"
"11596","Although it’s sometimes uneven with somewhat underdeveloped characters, I Don’t Feel at Home is nonetheless a clever blend of two very different genres. Blair’s mix of humor and feverish violence works best in the film’s final act, when things turn completely nutty.","70","5710514"
"11597","A gravely beautiful drama about the mysteries of aging and death.","70","421715"
"11598","The movie is best when it calms down and concentrates on the sinister peculiarities of the experience, and when it focuses on Franco's face. [8 Nov. 2010, p . 93]","70","1542344"
"11599","Hellraiser is a well-paced si-fi cum horror fantasy. Pic is well made, well acted, and the visual effects are generally handled with skill.","70","93177"
"11600","In his florid sci-fi opera Interstellar, Christopher Nolan aims for the stars, and the upshot is an infinite hoot — its dumbness o’erleaps dimensional space. It’s hugely entertaining, though.","70","816692"
"11601","A romantic tale of love interrupted the isolation that is an inherent part of the human condition and ultimately the importance of the seemingly smaller moments in life.","70","1315981"
"11602","With no car chases or artificial villains to get in the way, and no treacly contrivances to force unearned emotions, the bright, vaguely sitcom-styled movie is free to make audiences feel good on its own genuine terms.","70","4501454"
"11603","A piece of fluff that can be enjoyed without guilt.","70","125439"
"11604","While seriousness has overtaken the Bond franchise in recent years (hardly a bad thing, mind you), Kingsman runs no such risk. Vaughn welcomes details that might seem silly in another director’s hands, such as a bulletproof umbrella or tiny microchips that can make one’s head explode, presenting everything playfully enough that plausibility isn’t a factor.","70","2802144"
"11605","Often enjoyable, massively uneven Brit ganglander with an almost surreal approach to the genre.","70","203119"
"11606","An effective political melodrama that induces a peculiar emotion--the bitterness generated by an old anger that has faded into dull exasperation and now flares up again. [8 Nov. 2010, p.92]","70","977855"
"11607","More often than not, Deadpool’s bratty energy feels liberating, allowing for a sexier, dirtier, more hilarious superhero movie than the typical all-ages Marvel affair, which is so concerned with maximising profits that it risks offending no one.","70","1431045"
"11608","Arguably the director's least typical film, it doesn't dodge the potholes of earnest sentimentality and at times overplays the whimsy. But the uplifting tale has heart, humanity and a warmly empathetic central performance from Matt Damon.","70","1389137"
"11609","There's plenty of atmosphere and awe, even if it's in the service of a story that starts rote and finds its sea legs only when half the divers have sunk their bones to Davy Jones.","70","881320"
"11610","Flipped is the kind of small, special movie that wraps you up in so much warmth, humor and humanity that it will leave you wishing that stories like this weren't so rare.","70","817177"
"11611","Jonathon Mostow, who wrote the script and then directed the movie, travels mostly familiar backroads and crosses bridges when he comes to them, actually managing a pretty good cliff-hanging denouement on the latter.","70","118771"
"11612","As it turns out, the three men in Three Men and a Baby haven't got a clue about diapers -- or bottles or formula or anything concerning babies. They're bachelors -- New York yuppies -- who share a fantastic (and, undoubtedly, astronomically priced) apartment in Manhattan. How the lives of the threesome are changed by the new arrival is the crux of this good-natured comedy.","70","94137"
"11613","The movie's horror-comics second half is cheesy, derivative, and ultimately a little wearying. But it's also unpretentious and insanely cheerful.","70","116367"
"11614","The theme--that just beyond the edge of the perfectly normal lies the truly bizarre--is realized with intelligence and visual flair.","70","99487"
"11615","Drawn from a children's book by Croatian illustrator Milan Trenc, this fantasy isn't exactly heavy, but its ideological implications are interesting nevertheless.","70","477347"
"11616","What many American movies do well these days -- action, violence, hell-for-leather street spectacle -- Darkman does better. That may be praise enough. [24 Aug. 1990, p.F10]","70","99365"
"11617","Like the male-bonding movies upon which it's modeled, it celebrates letting down your hair with your own gender.","70","112571"
"11618","Confrontational and hyperactive, Enter the Void is a difficult film to experience. That's not because Noe is somehow inept. The Argentina-born French writer-director knows exactly what he's doing and what effect his swirling camera, exuberant colors and strobelike effects will have.","70","1191111"
"11619","The comic pizazz and bawdy dazzle of this film's vision of gaudy drag performers trekking across the Australian outback certainly has a boisterous, addictive way about it. [10 Aug 1994]","70","109045"
"11620","As stomach-turning as might be expected, but it has a lot going for it: clever special effects, a good leading performance and a villain so chatty he practically makes this a human-interest story.","70","89686"
"11621","Gillespie’s movie walks a delicate line through a minefield of potential bad taste. Directed with patient, low-key sensitivity, it never goes for a cheap laugh at its protagonist’s expense.","70","805564"
"11622","Once the plotters plunge into action, though, Valkyrie becomes both an exciting thriller and a useful history lesson.","70","985699"
"11623","The movie nails all this, and it’s smashingly effective as melodrama. But McQueen’s directorial voice — cold, stark, deterministic — keeps it from attaining the kind of grace that marks the voice of a true film artist.","70","2024544"
"11624","Featuring outstanding lead performances by Kevin Costner, Susan Sarandon, and Tim Robbins; a witty, literate script; and an insider's familiarity with life around minor league baseball--Bull Durham is both one of the best films ever made about the national pastime and a charming romantic comedy.","70","94812"
"11625","Although the seams may show on a narrative level, and some may find it over-cooked, this is a luxurious slide into female neurosis.","70","4326444"
"11626","Déjà Vu is pretty dazzling, as action adventures go, even when it's wildly, almost defiantly, implausible. Movies can make us semi-believe the damnedest things.","70","453467"
"11627","Given the source material, the film is as good as respectful adaptation could make it: a high-class soap opera, compulsively watchable despite a quality of insight eventually exposed as trite and dubious in the extreme. [26 Sep 1980, p.F1]","70","81283"
"11628","Can you tell it’s a play? Absolutely. Does that mean a damn thing? Not when the writing is this richly evocative, and the cast so often soars with it.","70","2671706"
"11629","Much like how its employees and patrons don't want to see the barbershop close, once one has become acquainted with these people and this place, one may not want Barbershop to end.","70","303714"
"11630","Piercing, sweetly melancholy and acted with a breathtaking eye for nuance.","70","120255"
"11631","Even if this material might have been better served as a 40-minute short than as a full-length movie, first-time feature director Dan Trachtenberg has cast a trio of actors at the top of their game, and they elevate the material.","70","1179933"
"11632","If the film is ultimately an exercise in atmosphere, it is without question a triumph on that front. The rich textures and almost tactile visuals are astonishing.","70","2554274"
"11633","The jokes fly fast and sometimes very funny. They are, more often, crude and homophobic. Still, a genuine sweetness lurks.","70","405422"
"11634","This thriller can sometimes be too mechanical — a breezy exercise if not always an emotionally satisfying one — and yet the large cast’s willingness to get on Johnson’s brainy, sprightly wavelength makes this an enjoyable romp.","70","8946378"
"11635","But the material is still powerful, and the offbeat story of the patients remains both engrossing and moving even after all this abridgment.","70","99077"
"11636","An entertaining affair whose wild-card creativity never ceases to surprise.","70","265208"
"11637","I will admit that this TV skit stretched out to a filament-thin 83 minutes is idiotic, but I mean that in a good way.","70","120770"
"11638","Quite pleasant.","70","185014"
"11639","The Post is a good enough “procedural” to keep you hooked.","70","6294822"
"11640","Thoroughly gripping.","70","146309"
"11641","Ghostbusters II doesn't seem to be pushing as hard as its predecessor, which of course makes it even more fun. There's an old-shoeishness to the proceedings; even Murray's owlish put-downs seem a little less snide-they're almost affectionate, if that's not too outrageous a word in this context. [16 Jun 1989, p.1]","70","97428"
"11642","Unlike some of its recent ilk – ""Spider-Man,"" for example – The Punisher is, no disrespect, a thoroughly morose and bilious affair. That is precisely what I like best about it.","70","330793"
"11643","The result is somewhat better than a Masterpiece Theatre gloss job, but it's far from the essence of Woolf.","70","274558"
"11644","If you’re patient, though, and not put off by the familiarity of this material, Summer of ’84 gains in interest and urgency as it goes.","70","5774450"
"11645","Shannon makes the man's dilemma plain and moving, and that gives Take Shelter a resonance that last long after the final fade out.","70","1675192"
"11646","As transparent as this device is, Angels has elemental satisfactions in its blend of movie genre that could appeal to wide segments of the audience.","70","808151"
"11647","Roger Avary's crisp adaptation imbues the copious bad sex and general befuddlement of Bret Easton Ellis's solemn, echt '80s Bennington novel with a playfully obnoxious energy that is often funny and -- almost fun.","70","292644"
"11648","The film is a little too sprightly to land any heavy punches — it’s more of a comedy with satirical elements than a true satirical tale. ... But hate can be both worthy of ridicule and deadly serious, and for the most part Jojo Rabbit manages to thread that needle.","70","2584384"
"11649","It doesn't disappoint. It gets the job done thanks in large part to the breakout performance given by Galifianakis. It's no ""Old School,"" but it will do nicely until that film's anticipated sequel rolls around in 2011.","70","1119646"
"11650","A fairly enjoyable piece of junk from Oliver Stone.","70","120399"
"11651","What saves the movie's sobering latter developments, giving it an emotional wallop that overrides the flaws, is partly the sadness playing across Dafoe's face as Bobby watches from the sidelines.","70","5649144"
"11652","Condon's obvious attempts to draw parallels between Whale's life and his work tend to be heavy-handed, and detract from an otherwise intriguing film.","70","120684"
"11653","It may be clumsily made, shamelessly contrived and utterly cynical in its calculated uplift, but there's no getting around it: the damn thing is funny.","70","105417"
"11654","What results, against some odds, is an intriguing entertainment. Adjustment Bureau's central concept is certainly ingenious, but the details are a little wonky and don't stand up to too much scrutiny.","70","1385826"
"11655","Carpenter returns to his roots, which is to say he's gouging eyes and summoning demons. He's doing it in a wonderfully rough-hewn, low-budget style that fondly recalls Halloween, the granddaddy of slasher movies. [24 Oct 1987, p.1D]","70","93777"
"11656","A pretty impressive horror film.","70","185937"
"11657","A logistical wonder, a marvel of engineering, and relentlessly, mercilessly thrilling.","70","95016"
"11658","Very nearly a corking sci-fi lark.","70","60397"
"11659","The idea of Bean fitting into this situation, even disastrously, requires more than suspension of disbelief. It requires a full blackout of reasoning. But for the converted, and for people with a low threshold for visual comedy, Bean amounts to a hill of laughs.","70","118689"
"11660","This bleak vision directed by Darren Aronofsky (""Pi"") is pointless with good reason.","70","180093"
"11661","Some of the precise meanings of this Bill Forsyth comedy eluded me, but the vibes couldn't have been nicer.","70","106379"
"11662","Juvenile, sloppy and frequently, idiotically hilarious.","70","185431"
"11663","It manages to be funny and charming while capturing a lot of disturbing things about the way we live now.","70","385267"
"11664","Less a classical narrative than an ingenious machine for inducing terror, rage, and paralyzing unease.","70","387564"
"11665","The strangest thing about writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson's unusual romantic comedy is how much of it is based on a true story.","70","272338"
"11666","The result looks as much like a Natural History Museum diorama as it sounds: a respectful but waxy re-creation that feels somehow awe-inspiring yet chillingly lifeless to behold, the great exception being Jones' alternately blistering and sage turn as Stevens.","70","443272"
"11667","Searing drama that uses the police procedural to explore the moral and psychological devastation of the Iraq war for U.S. soldiers (and, incidentally, for Iraqi citizens).","70","478134"
"11668","Demme's pacing is tight throughout, marred only by some low-angle close-ups of the cannibal that are right out of old Vincent Price thrillers. [Feb 18, 1991]","70","102926"
"11669","You can try not liking this adaptation of the Off-Broadway musical hit -- it has no polish and a pushy way with a gag -- but the movie sneaks up on you. [29 Dec 1986, p.71]","70","91419"
"11670","A fine film in a strong summer, but it lacks the spark that made its immediate predecessor a masterpiece.","70","1345836"
"11671","The performances take the movie to a higher level.","70","286162"
"11672","Even with all its ups and downs, there are more than enough bawdy laughs and truthful emotional moments to put this over as a mainstream audience pleaser during a holiday season short on good comedies.","70","1758830"
"11673","The story has its corny aspects, but thanks to Scott's skill as an image maker and as a storyteller--proceeding from the very blue and very abstract water seen behind the credits to the climactic, extended storm--this is superior to both ""Dead Poets Society"" (as a tale about a boys' school and its charismatic teacher) and ""Apollo 13"" (as a true-life action adventure).","70","118158"
"11674","Director Josh Boone is hardly the most distinctive cinematic stylist, but he’s smart enough to let his scenes linger for a few beats longer than most mainstream directors would, and seems to trust his actors to carry their own dramatic weight.","70","2582846"
"11675","A tender yet heavily de-romanticized love story between a boxer with broken hands and an orca trainer with missing legs, Rust and Bone serves as an impressive if somewhat overblown exercise in contrasts.","70","2053425"
"11676","The movie, while entertaining and extremely well crafted, is too self-conscious about its depravity to be either truly disturbing or disturbingly funny. Ticking along with metronome-like efficiency, it's more slick than sick.","70","2267998"
"11677","Alcoholic movie characters run the gamut from lovable millionaire (Arthur) to Skid Row bum (Henry Chinaski from Barfly) to all-out, suicidal depressive (Ben from Leaving Las Vegas). As written and performed, Winstead's Kate triangulates between all these approaches and finds a sincerity that plays to the intellect, not to the rafters.","70","2063781"
"11678","The warm humanizing element in all the cool stuff is Crowe.","70","172495"
"11679","If the movie remains safe, there's no questioning its integrity, or the balance of porcelain vulnerability and strength that Eddie Redmayne brings to the lead role.","70","810819"
"11680","Bernhard Schlink's highly regarded novel ""The Reader"" receives a graceful, absorbing screen adaptation by director Stephen Daldry.","70","976051"
"11681","It's a feel-good frolic, which is fine for anyone who prefers their Hitchcock history tidied up, absent the megalomania, the condescending cruelty and tendency to sexual harassment that caused his post-Psycho blonde discovery Tippi Hedren to declare him ""a mean, mean man.""","70","975645"
"11682","Blockers sells itself as a parents-first warpath comedy, but the true treat here is watching a trio of young women navigate sex-comedy narratives that boys have dominated for far too long.","70","2531344"
"11683","Both actors are excellent--but there's something conventionally gimmicky about the way it plays its reality/unreality game.","70","137523"
"11684","I can't deny it: I had a shit-eating grin on my face for most of the ensuing two hours. I also can't deny that many of the criticisms about to be leveled at Spielberg and Lucas over ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" are well-deserved, but it's still good to see Indiana Jones, and Marion, back in action one last time.","70","367882"
"11685","A firstrate underwater suspenser with an otherworldly twist, The Abyss suffers from a payoff unworthy of its buildup.","70","96754"
"11686","Al Pacino gives an electric performance, charged with a lunatic energy that expertly captures the weird blend of confidence and self-deprecation (if not hatred) that marks the paranoid syndrome.","70","72890"
"11687","Some powerful dialogue.","70","120363"
"11688","Dry White Season is no less predictable than its predecessors, but its frankness and sincerity matter more than its fundamental bluntness.","70","97243"
"11689","You feel for the first time that Scorsese is trying to distance himself from his characters—that he finds them grotesque. The uncenteredness of the film is irritating, though it's irritating in an ambitious, risk-taking way. You'd better see for yourself.","70","85794"
"11690","Ceases to be a cogent study of the disease of genius and devolves into two lesser creatures: an ordinary weepie and an Oscar contender.","70","117631"
"11691","Eye in the Sky is literally all over the map in its depiction of drone warfare, and right on target, if flagrantly contrived, in examining the ethics of killing by remote control.","70","2057392"
"11692","Dead Men Tell No Tales doesn’t rewrite the rulebook for the franchise or the genre as a whole, and is wholly predictable from start to finish, but the likable characters—Thwaites and Scodelario have more natural presence and mutual chemistry than Bloom and Knightley—creative action set pieces, and Depp finally being put in his place in the franchise creates a fun ride that’s instantly forgettable. You know, like the ride itself.","70","1790809"
"11693","The action is entertaining enough, and it's kind of fun to follow the intricate plotting and planning of the jobs.","70","472399"
"11694","An emotionally powerful but extremely old-fashioned coming-of-age saga.","70","119381"
"11695","Marvelously detailed and meticulously crafted, an elegant evocation of Depression-era America and its fascination with crime. What the movie lacks is any sense of elation--it’s joyless by choice.","70","1152836"
"11696","Despite occasional patches of hokey dialogue, this drama by writer-director Craig Brewer is solid and genuinely uplifting.","70","410097"
"11697","Basically, Drive is a song of courtly love and devotion among the automatons. It's a machine, but it works.","70","780504"

"11700","By turns intriguing, boring, frustrating, amazing and stirring, this is a tour de force that, necessarily, lacks dramatic force, but one that creates a dream state of seemingly limitless dimensions.","70","318034"
"11701","Transcendence is a dark, lurchingly entertaining pastiche of age-old worries, future-shock jolts, hot-button topics and old-fashioned genre thrills.","70","2209764"
"11702","The Darjeeling Limited works best when the level of artifice is at its highest and most overt.","70","838221"
"11703","Lacks the wonder, surprises and supercool attitude Cameron achieved. ""T3"" is no weak sister, though. With Arnold Schwarzenegger back as the iconic title character and an often witty, fast-paced script by John Brancato, Michael Ferris and Tedi Sarafian, audiences worldwide will embrace the new film.","70","181852"
"11704","Blends and recycles elements of scores of crime and road movies, from ""Bonnie and Clyde"" to ""Badlands"" but it does so with enough energy and verve to create something entirely fresh and infectiously entertaining.","70","108399"
"11705","Neveldine and Taylor’s spazzy (but coherent) action scenes rely mostly on blood spurts instead of feats of badassery, but their dystopia is inventive and their visual schemes diverse.","70","1034032"
"11706","Nothing from the book is left to wither away. That should please the vast reading audience that'll watch the movie.","70","295297"
"11707","This film is sensitively wrought. It’s credible in its evocation of mid-’70s suburbia. The acting is excellent throughout, and Ross Lynch in the role of Dahmer elicits genuine sympathy for an increasingly lost but not yet monstrous soul. But in abandoning the subjective perspective of the graphic novel, My Friend Dahmer feels a little lacking in purpose.","70","2291540"
"11708","Phantom Thread sweeps you up and carries you along, much more, to my mind, than “The Master” did. Yet it’s a thesis movie: the story of a bullying narcissist who lacks the ability to have a relationship, and the outrageous way he’s schooled into becoming a human being. It’s the story of a control freak made by a control freak.","70","5776858"
"11709","A farrago of cartoonish exaggeration (mouthfuls of fangs, razor-sharp talons and eyes like burning coals), knowing humour and '80s camp, it shouldn't even begin to work, and yet, strangely, it does, sort of, thanks to the assured handling of writer/director Holland, and two performances in particular - Geoffreys as Charley's pal Evil, and McDowall as the timid vampire killer.","70","89175"
"11710","Finally, a voice-over from Jimmy Carter, lauding the efforts of those involved. All this is, frankly, uncool - a pity, because the rest of Argo feels clever, taut, and restrained.","70","1024648"
"11711","Crash has no plot to speak of. It's a cinematic tone poem of collisions and coitus.","70","115964"
"11712","Code of Silence is a predictability cacophonous cops-and-crooks yarn [by Michael Butler and Dennis Shryack] that is actually quite good for the type.","70","88936"
"11713","A crowd-pleaser despite its missteps and occasionally because of them, the pic enlivens some stale conceits about killers-for-hire and the women who love them.","70","2091935"
"11714","Let's not pretend otherwise: The comedy here is profane, juvenile, silly. Fine by me, because some of it also is hilarious.","70","1499658"
"11715","The Coens engineer a funny, entertaining battle of the sexes here, but the preponderance of indelible male characters and less memorable female roles render it something of a mismatch.","70","138524"
"11716","While War for the Planet of the Apes's third act is a bit hairy, the sequel helps cement the franchise as one of the more exciting mainstream properties worth watching.","70","3450958"
"11717","Settles for simply being goofy good fun.","70","1323594"
"11718","The scenes that Chastain and Elba share are enormously enjoyable. There’s a crackling, almost screwball quality to their rapid-fire banter. You rather wish they had more screen time together. But there’s a lot of backstory to explore and many fools to be parted from their money.","70","4209788"
"11719","It’s Rylance who keeps Bridge of Spies standing. He gives a teeny, witty, fabulously non-emotive performance, every line musical and slightly ironic — the irony being his forthright refusal to deceive in a world founded on lies.","70","3682448"
"11720","The picture is sharp, in a warm, fuzzy way, about the ways women can sometimes inflict cruelty on other women in the name of feminism. Feminism doesn't have to be the enemy of kindness, but sometimes -- alarmingly often -- it is.","70","852713"
"11721","A solidly engrossing political drama, anchored by a commanding central performance from Liam Neeson.","70","5175450"
"11722","A spellbinding, sensationally effective thriller with a complex moral center.","70","1392214"
"11723","At the end of Inception, I hadn't lived through the grueling emotional journey Nolan seemed to think I had, but I'd seen a bunch of cool images and admired some technically ambitious feats of filmmaking.","70","1375666"
"11724","The Ides of March says that American politics, no less than Italian, is a beachfront property with sharks surfing the waves. That makes this skeptical, savory movie a fitting offering from Hollywood's suavest ambassador to Venice and the world.","70","1124035"
"11725","It's less a movie than a delivery system for sensory pleasures, sunny romance and designer-label stuff that in real life would result in diabetic shock (or at least a ruined credit rating).","70","1000774"
"11726","The best reason to watch Little Men is Michael Barbieri, who musters a blend of soulfulness and aggression that would be remarkable at any age.","70","4919484"
"11727","Mr. Douglas, who delivers a new shade of cruel elegance each time he plays another urbane monster, is the ideal star for this vigorously contrived thriller.","70","119174"
"11728","With its emphasis on dialogue and political machinations over explosions and kung fu fighting, it remains to be see whether or not V for Vendetta will actually find one (a wider audience).","70","434409"
"11729","With its energetic cast and insistent street score, it still manages to be poignant without becoming bathetic, and violent without being exploitative.","70","101507"
"11730","The ancient body-switching premise is animated by a breezy script that briefly addresses some of its darker implications.","70","974661"
"11731","Whether or not the “Wolverine” movies have a future — Jackman swears this is his last go-round — Logan is an exceedingly entertaining one.","70","3315342"
"11732","Itself owing much to such lone-man-of-action hallmarks as “Die Hard” and “Speed,” this welcome throwback to an earlier, more generously entertaining era of summer blockbusters delivers a wide array of close-quarters combat and large-scale destruction, all grounded in an immensely appealing star turn by Channing Tatum and ace support from imperiled POTUS Jamie Foxx.","70","2334879"
"11733","[A] generation-gap soap opera of the 50s, which had more emotional resonance for the teenagers of the time than many much better movies.","70","48545"
"11734","In jettisoning the focus on family of the previous films, it gives us characters whose interactions with each other feel less than detailed, and who are more archetypal than real. But it’s good clean fun nevertheless, and the set pieces expertly supply the tension-and-release satisfactions of the genre.","70","5814060"
"11735","Drag Me to Hell is an eyeball-gouging lesson in how to make a genre flick and live to tell about it.","70","1127180"
"11736","Overlong, but with moments of greatness.","70","77416"
"11737","The absolutely tremendous and unforgettable display of physically powerful acting that Anne Bancroft and Patty Duke put on in William Gibson's stage play The Miracle Worker is repeated by them in the film made from it by the same producer, Fred Coe, and the same director, Arthur Penn.","70","56241"
"11738","The pic is so well directed and lead performance by Sanaa Lathan so charismatic that audiences will overlook the script's flaws and root for the central duo.","70","199725"
"11739","Jeff Nichols’ much-anticipated follow-up to his breakthrough second feature Take Shelter feels less adventurous and unsettling but remains a well carpentered piece of work marked by some fine performances and resilient thematic fiber.","70","1935179"
"11740","Like Gekko, the film also feels urgent and strangely necessary.","70","1027718"
"11741","Rather than trading le Carré's downbeat but agonizingly true-to-life ending for something more palatable, Meirelles has crafted a rare sort of thriller that refuses to resolve real-life issues for the sake of feel-good entertainment.","70","387131"
"11742","An enjoyably trashy blend of impressive special effects, low-key refs to Landis's movie, and sudden moments of horror breaking the jokey tone.","70","118604"
"11743","This runs 192 minutes and has very few jokes, but there are many references to Citizen Kane to put us in the right frame of mind.","70","113987"
"11744","Visually and structurally it's a mess, but many of the situations are genuinely clever, and there are plenty of memorable gags. The perpetual problem is that Allen isn't nearly the thinker he thinks he is.","70","75686"
"11745","That's not to say it's great; it's not. Maybe it's not to say it's good, because it's only sort of good. It is to say, however, that it's nifty.","70","421239"
"11746","An intermittently powerful and meticulously crafted drama that falls short of its full potential due to considerable over-length and some shopworn, simplistic notions at its center.","70","120689"
"11747","Mann turns Miami Vice into an exploration of tone and mood, and he makes that enough.","70","430357"
"11748","This is a Cuisinart of a movie, mixing familiar yet disparate ingredients, making something odd, possibly distasteful, undeniably arresting out of them. [5 Dec 1994, p. 93]","70","110413"
"11749","Though the story goes a country too far and gets lost in its dénouement, the movie is, for the most part, a playful and giddy delight.","70","6663582"
"11750","What makes me respect The Man Who Wasn't There despite myself is the sense that the Coens want it to be about something that can't be described or defined.","70","243133"
"11751","By casting Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum as fish-out-of-water buffoons, the irreverent result feels fresher than most '80s-show reboots, effectively flipping the address Johnny Depp made famous.","70","1232829"
"11752","Taken on the level of spectacle rather than of sense, The Last Samurai affords the sort of fizzy enjoyment that can come with epic movie endeavors, including a meticulously detailed world unlike our own, an excellent supporting cast and some pulse-pounding fights.","70","325710"
"11753","It's a spry, fluffy comedy.","70","1196141"
"11754","The film offers up more than enough in terms of intelligence, insight, historical research and religious nuance as to not at all be considered a missed opportunity.","70","4196450"
"11755","Astute and painfully relevant political comedy.","70","7074886"
"11756","A gorgeously drawn myth made for plucky children and very brave mice.","70","100477"
"11757","Surrogates stays afloat by not taking itself too seriously, but also by recognizing that a movie about robots shouldn't look as if it were made by one.","70","986263"
"11758","Both genuinely funny and authentically horrifying, it puts the average horror comedy to shame.","70","365748"
"11759","It's clear the filmmakers aren't simply expecting to coast on audience goodwill...Men in Black 3 is at its best when it simply owns its own absurdity.","70","1409024"
"11760","Easily the most unique film in the trilogy, and in many ways the most fun.","70","106308"
"11761","No masterpiece, Persia is fun for exactly as long as it takes to sit through it.","70","473075"
"11762","Mr. Wallace clearly has a fondness for the cliches he is parodying and he does it with style.","70","85636"
"11763","Fast and funny and brings back some of the wonder to the series.","70","163025"
"11764","It has a gentle, unforced rhythm, and what’s there is good and true. But there’s not enough of it--the movie needs more plot, more complication, more conflict.","70","1263670"
"11765","Makes the most of its format, soaring when its young hero rides on his winged reptilian pal, and full of heart and heroism even when its action is grounded.","70","892769"
"11766","Much of this is fascinating, as far as it goes, but it wouldn't go as far as it does into drama were it not for Ms. Johansson's wonderfully strange performance.","70","1441395"
"11767","Jackie is Natalie Portman's show, and she never wastes an opportunity to dazzle as JFK's glamorous grieving widow.","70","1619029"
"11768","The excitement comes from Frakes's direction -- his liveliness, and his pleasure in looking at, and showing us, events and images.","70","117731"
"11769","The movie suffers perhaps from too many characters and subplots but all the actors appear to have fun with their characters.","70","1570728"
"11770","The movie has a big payoff; it's the setup that's the drag. But Kevin's antics will touch the budding subversive in every kid. My advice? Hide the car keys.","70","99785"
"11771","In short, those of us who pursue Mariolatry — the worship of all things Poppins — are free to delight in this film. Indeed, it shifts a little nearer than its predecessor did to the spiky, peppery briskness of Travers’s tales, and the whole enterprise exhales, as it should, an air of the politely mad.","70","5028340"
"11772","Anchored by a funny, foul-mouthed performance from McDormand, McDonagh’s daringly-structured dark comedy is rich and layered and often laugh-out-loud funny but trips over constant tonal shifts.","70","5027774"
"11773","Because the emotional drama is so one-sided, I just can't love you.","70","1022603"
"11774","Aimed at the brain, when it should have been one for the heart.","70","315733"
"11775","To the extent that Adele’s hunger for affection resonates with audiences, what emerges is a powerful — if implausible — romance.","70","1967545"
"11776","Cleverness can be overrated but it can be underrated too, and the best thing about National Treasure is how clever it is.","70","368891"
"11777","The first half of this 1997 movie suffers from abstraction. Still, it's a compelling erotic nightmare.","70","116922"
"11778","The dark fantasist in Lucas makes a comeback after years of once-over-lightly.","70","121765"
"11779","A vigorous and engrossing genre exercise that manages the difficult trick of being both logically meticulous and genuinely surprising. Its elaborately implausible story gestures now and then toward an idea, but the movie's main concern is technique.","70","360009"
"11780","The latest film from Chris Renaud (Despicable Me) and his team is a madcap caper full of densely-packed sight gags, dizzying action set pieces and a healthy side-helping of Renaud trademark silliness.","70","2709768"
"11781","It's the brilliance of The X-Files to have turned Mulder's paranoid style into a function of cool. Mulder and Scully aren't just beautiful, smart, well-armed and seemingly impervious to the banalities of everyday life, such as cheap haircuts and ruinous love affairs--they're cool.","70","120902"
"11782","Overall Simon's ego-splitting wisecracks make for many good laughs, even though, in contrast to Woody Allen's nervous New York humour, which has the discomforting ring of truth, Simon opts for a playwright's ring of confidence.","70","76095"
"11783","Spiked with wonderfully funny sequences and some brilliantly original notions, The Big Lebowski, a pseudo-mystery thriller with a keen eye and ear for societal mores and modern figures of speech, nonetheless adds up to considerably less than the sum of its often scintillating parts.","70","118715"
"11784","Absent the ability to really get the audience’s heads in the game, the film succeeds better at presenting chess as a subtle metaphor for the psychological warfare being waged behind the scenes.","70","1596345"
"11785","Although execution doesn’t quite live up to the fabulous premise, Escape from New York is a solidly satisfying actioner.","70","82340"
"11786","There is little that is original in Starman, but at least it has chosen good models.","70","88172"
"11787","[LaBeouf is] one of the few actors capable of turning this protector companion on the page into a layered role.","70","4364194"
"11788","Win Win goes a bit soft in places, protecting its characters from serious danger or tough moral reckoning. But the film's niceness is also central to its appeal, because nearly all of the characters are people you enjoy spending time with.","70","1606392"
"11789","For many, eXistenZ will probably be more trick than treat. But the film epitomizes the phrase sui generis (""of its own kind"") and still maintains a wry attitude toward itself.","70","120907"
"11790","With its retro pacing, its pretentious lapses and its narrow emotional range, this elegantly crafted existential thriller risks alienating its audience; at times it feels like a test for attention deficit disorder.","70","1440728"
"11791","On the one hand a captivating and inspiring tale of a boy's journey to courage amid searing injustice, pic often gives way to scenes of intense violence that are likely to bludgeon the very sensibilities it seeks to awaken.","70","105159"
"11792","Sam Rockwell kills as the hero's loony tunes best friend, deliciously abetted by Christopher Walken as an aging, sad-sack dognapper.","70","1931533"
"11793","This expensive genre film about stock car racing has many of the elements that made the same team's Top Gun a blockbuster, but the producers recruited scripter Robert Towne to make more out of the story than junk food.","70","99371"
"11794","Sure, the story is pretty standard, and the dialogue is laughable or worse. But creative cinematography and non-stop, decently choreographed gratuitous violence make watching this comic-book movie—Blade is a minor, almost-forgotten Marvel comic—entertaining.","70","120611"
"11795","It's much more of an action flick than either ""Metropolis"" or ""Blade Runner,"" but there's a provocative and visionary side to this free adaptation of Isaac Asimov's SF classic that puts it in the same thoughtful canon.","70","343818"
"11796","Its determined ambition and atmospheric skill keeps Saulnier firmly in the category of directors to watch.","70","5057140"
"11797","Freundlich’s approach to the film is respectful to the original but begs the question of why translate this particular film for a more mainstream audience. He does so deftly but After the Wedding trods in some familiar melodramatic territories, which may not have the same impact as the original.","70","7985692"
"11798","The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas is just about everything it's meant to be - a couple of diverting hours in the dark. Rollicking, good-natured, a bit spicy and with just enough heart to avoid seeming totally synthetic.","70","83642"
"11799","The rich visuals seem at odds with the spartan content of the screenplay, with skating nuns like penguins on a frozen pond, cows lowing, pigeons flapping, statues weeping, novices in white gowns splayed like crucifixes on the stone cold floor. We're left with these images when we should be left pondering the cosmos, shortchanged by the saints and the scientists alike, denied our just epiphany. [27 Sept 1985, p.25]","70","88683"
"11800","More than anything else, When a Stranger Calls resembles a good, old-fashioned grade B thriller.","70","80130"
"11801","Corny as that is, the film's nadir comes when Zuckerberg's pretty young lawyer comforts him (or us) with the mealy-mouthed observation, ""You're not an asshole, Mark. You're just trying so hard to be one.""","70","1285016"
"11802","It would be something to see Mr. Bateman go authentically dark (perhaps not that dark), but it’s also enough just to watch him as he widens his eyes, furrows his brow and shows off his excellent timing.","70","2170299"
"11803","But it also has enough buoyant '70s music to shake anybody's tail feather, and a kind of easy jubilance of narrative and character. Bet it makes you wanna dance. [11 Oct 1993]","70","106677"
"11804","Indeed, their most inspired moment is a total non sequitur -- a parody of ""Jaws"" involving a Baby Ruth bar and a pool full of terrified swimmers. Nonetheless, between Dangerfield's jokes, which charge like rhinos, and Chase's droll backhand swipes, there are just enough laughs to keep this harmless farce rolling to the eighteenth hole. [11 Aug 1980, p.69]","70","80487"
"11805","Lynch's third feature may have been a commercial disaster, but it gets under your skin and is marked by unforgettable images and an extraordinary soundtrack.","70","87182"
"11806","Will Smith and Martin Lawrence bring their A game; they never let us feel as if they’re going through the motions. The marks may be standard issue, but they hit them with fury and flair.","70","1502397"
"11807","A deliriously cinematic experience for those with a taste for Grand Guignol, this is a relentlessly energetic nightmare world where quite literally anything can happen--and does.","70","92991"
"11808","Saoirse Ronan and Margot Robbie are both superb in muted performances and, while the film’s palace intrigue gets a bit dense, the story never loses sight of its deep compassion for these characters and their shared plight of being held hostage by conniving, belittling, power-hungry men determined to usurp their authority.","70","2328900"
"11809","In the end M.A.S.H. succeeds, in spite of its glaring faults, because Gould, Sutherland, Skerritt, Jo Ann Pflug as the delicious Lt. Dish, and Roger Bowen, as the goof-off commanding officer who is bright enough to recognize his junior officers' medical competence and stay out of their way, are all believable and bitingly funny in their casual disdain for the Army.","70","66026"
"11810","But the look of a movie is not as important as how it feels. The Sting feels like a cold shower. One dashes into it primarily because of its superior cast.","70","70735"
"11811","But it doesn't quite all come together here as it did onstage, and relentless scabrousness, heavy claustrophobia and a vaguely dated feel are among the elements that will keep mainstream audiences away.","70","104348"
"11812","It may not ""boldly go where no one has gone before,"" but Star Trek Generations has enough verve, imagination and familiarity to satisfy three decades' worth of Trekkers raised on several incarnations of the television skein. [14 Nov. 1994, p.47]","70","111280"
"11813","If Drew Barrymore weren't at the center holding it all together, the result could have been disastrous.","70","151738"
"11814","Basic Instinct transfers Mr. Verhoeven's flair for action-oriented material to the realm of Hitchcockian intrigue, and the results are viscerally effective even when they don't make sense. Drawing powerfully on the seductiveness of his actors and the intensity of their situation, Mr. Verhoeven easily suspends all disbelief.","70","103772"
"11815","Less a movie than a seething psychological bonanza.","70","212720"
"11816","Witherspoon turns in yet another stellar, nuanced comic performance.","70","250494"
"11817","Sometimes Shults’ reach exceeds his grasp, resulting in a self-conscious epic that wants to hammer home its characters’ emotional wreckage. Nevertheless, Waves is also powerfully immersive, investing so passionately in these individuals that it’s hard not to do the same.","70","8652728"
"11818","The camerawork is unadventurous (the only variation on static observation of the characters being the nature footage signalling the seasonal changes), but the performances Alda elicits from his co-actors almost justifies this. Within the characterisations, most of the fears and foibles of middle class, middle-aged America may be found. Amusing and worth a look.","70","82405"
"11819","It's too bad Baumbach's movie is already shot, edited, and up there on the screen, because after a few rounds with a red pencil, it could really have been something worth watching.","70","757361"
"11820","The messy uplift audiences can expect from this butterfly awakening they'll get in spades.","70","1233334"
"11821","Billy Bob Thornton's performance is--there's no other word--beautiful.","70","307987"
"11822","The whole work drips with a camp savagery (hence the presence of Sacha Baron Cohen as Pirelli, a rival barber and faux-Italianate fop), which in turn relies on the conviction that death itself, like sexual desire, exists to be sniffed at and chuckled over.","70","408236"
"11823","Tin Cup works for viewers of any handicap.","70","117918"
"11824","Throughout, despite its omniscient, stark melodrama, there has been no sight lost of an element of humor. Barry Fitzgerald, as the film’s focal point, in playing the police lieutenant of the homicide squad, strides through the role with tongue in cheek, with Don Taylor as his young detective aide.","70","40636"
"11825","Spacek is brilliantly funny, slowly transforming Helen from a nervous 60s housewife into a liquored-up one. I could have watched her in the vibrating fat-burner, eyes closed, lazily gripping a martini glass, for hours.","70","124298"
"11826","The deft arabesques of cinematographer Andrzej Bartkowiak juice up the suspense, and if you're not too put off by the sheer ridiculousness of the story you won't be bored.","70","111257"
"11827","Creed II is very much a Rocky sequel. It’s bigger, louder, and more over the top than its predecessor, with a more formulaic story and more absurd boxing matches. It’s satisfying as a pop confection, but it’s not as special or as rich as its predecessor.","70","6343314"
"11828","Essentially dumb and sadistic, but it's not like that's something new for pop culture. What we've got here is a solid, grade-B genre sequel, not as scary as the original but a bit funnier, and with a nasty little sting in its tail.","70","309593"
"11829","The movie manipulates its audience in cunning and puckish ways. It’s no big whoop, but you’re happy to have been played.","70","2704998"
"11830","Just when the seemingly endless scenes of Johansson's nagging threaten to sink Match Point for good, the movie becomes the thriller that early reports promised.","70","416320"
"11831","The result is itself a kind of diorama: exquisitely detailed, assembled with infinite care, but lacking the breath of life.","70","5208216"
"11832","A feel-good ending is mandatory, even in a comedy like this, which promises to be transgressive because it's the first major-studio job for a director with an underground reputation for being crazy-bold.","70","1197628"
"11833","Mr. Cameron has made a swift, exciting special-effects epic that thoroughly justifies its vast expense and greatly improves upon the first film's potent but rudimentary visual style. He has also broadened his initial idea to encompass better developed characters (after all, the first Terminator was barely verbal), a livelier wit and a more ambitious, if nuttier, message.","70","103064"
"11834","Mr. Polanski and Mr. Towne attempted nothing so witty and entertaining, being content instead to make a competently stylish, more or less thirites-ish movie that continually made me wish I were back seeing ""The Maltese Falcon"" or ""The Big Sleep."" Others may not be as finicky. [21 June 1974]","70","71315"
"11835","It's less successful as a human drama than as a near-Brechtian exercise in what human drama looks and sounds like - a distanced but often car-crash compelling portrait of a teen as an unfinished being.","70","466893"
"11836","The movie is most effective in its early scenes of prickly menace, and while the Dolphin is no Overlook (the haunted hotel in ""The Shining""), its old-world creepiness is exactly right.","70","450385"
"11837","This intelligent, oddly aloof thriller is a worthy follow-up to director Steven Soderberg's ""Out of Sight.""","70","165854"
"11838","Thank You for Smoking is a nifty but slight movie. Some of the writing is obvious, and the dramatic structure is flimsy, if not downright arbitrary. But Eckhart, in a sure-handed performance, holds the picture together.","70","427944"
"11839","The alluring surfaces of other people's lives can be deceiving, though generally not in a Nancy Meyers comedy, where the thin veneer of fantasy cloaks ... more fantasy.","70","457939"
"11840","Mr. Nemes orchestrates a tour de force of suspense, a swift symphony of collisions, coincidences and reversals that is almost unbearably exciting. His skill is undeniable, but also troubling. The movie offers less insight than sensation, an emotional experience that sits too comfortably within the norms of entertainment. This is not entirely the director’s fault. The Holocaust, once forbidden territory, is now safe and familiar ground.","70","3808342"
"11841","Laugh for laugh, Pineapple Express is way funnier than ""Superbad."" It may be the funniest mainstream comedy released so far this year (not that that means much when you've got ""The Love Guru"" pulling down your average).","70","910936"
"11842","Marley & Me gets so much surprisingly right. It may be designed to reach a broad audience, but it doesn't pander.","70","822832"

"11844","The racial satire is about as subtle as a sledgehammer, but there's something exhilarating about so blunt a weapon being swung with such wild abandon.","70","328099"
"11845","Isn't as lavish or flashy as the typical Bollywood product, and cricket aside, there's little to distinguish the plotting and wide-screen visuals from more traditional Hollywood musicals--though few recent American musicals are this fluid or engaging.","70","169102"
"11846","It's not the kind of work that wins awards, but without Cruise's intensity almost willing our interest in Spielberg's unrelentingly dark world, Minority Report wouldn't have nearly as much life as it does.","70","181689"
"11847","The film is said to be honest and about real people, and it affects some viewers very powerfully.","70","86423"
"11848","Above all, Jackson evokes an almost palpable sense of the will to power trapped within the ring. Without this evocation of the ring's insidious ability to sniff out the potential for corruption and capitalize on it, the entire enterprise would be precious drivel.","70","120737"
"11849","Courtesy of a vastly overlong, relatively unrousing 27-minute end-piece that may be the technical highpoint of the film, but lacks the punch and tightness of the earlier segments, the venture tends to run out of steam. Still, the net effect is an overridingly positive one.","70","82509"

"11853","Latest excursion is warmer, wittier, more socially relevant and truer to its TV origins than prior odysseys.","70","92007"
"11854","The combat visuals that follow are as powerful as those of any war film.","70","290334"
"11855","Is Looney Tunes: Back in Action a great achievement in animation? No, but I think that's the point of the film -- that the old cartoon characters and drawings are more human than the visual miracles produced by Disney and Pixar.","70","318155"
"11856","Fighting With My Family may not be an Oscar contender but it has enough wit, heart, energy and good cheer to make it a fun watch even for non-wrestling fans.","70","6513120"
"11857","It's the right format for this scattershot jokefest, which at times resembles a vaudeville act crossed with the kind of goofy bludgeoning antics that sometimes make it into gangsta MTV videos. [26 Apr 1995]","70","113118"
"11858","While the uniqueness of the film's Riyadh setting and the disturbing nature of Wadjda's depictions of life for women behind the Saudi curtain are thoroughly involving, the actual plotline of a 10-year-old girl's determination to own a bicycle can be as standard as it sounds.","70","2258858"
"11859","It comes by its screams honestly, earning them with incremental, at times agonizing gradations of old-fashioned, what's-that-noise-in-the-hallway suspense.","70","1179904"
"11860","Shampoo achieves a fine comic distance by setting itself so specifically in the past, but it doesn't - to its credit - try to get you, in the present, off the hook. [10 Feb 1975, p.51]","70","73692"
"11861","The Planet of the Apes series takes an angry turn in the fourth entry, Conquest of the Planet of the Apes.","70","68408"
"11862","About as understated as a 21-gun salute... What's missing is anything of Reiner himself.","70","104257"
"11863","Satisfying, old-fashioned family romp, but hardly a modern classic.","70","108333"
"11864","After a solid hour and a half, the climax almost seems to have come from a different movie. Collateral is still a hell of a ride, but could've used a smoother landing.","70","369339"
"11865","Made with an intelligence and craft that's increasingly rare in Hollywood thrillers.","70","373926"
"11866","Implausible in countless ways and wooden for long stretches, Gattaca at least never collapses into a special-effects barrage or erupts in long, choreographed explosions; it sticks carefully to its pristine vision.","70","119177"
"11867","One more film that could have been helped by excising repetition and focusing performances, but it wanders almost randomly instead. The heart-piercing moments that punctuate its rambling are glimpses of what a tighter film might have been.","70","120863"
"11868","It starts slow, but finishes fast with some clever plot twists. In the end, all is not lost with these boys.","70","93437"
"11869","More unsettling than frightening, it's still a trip worth taking.","70","8772262"
"11870","The process whereby Loretta and Ronny fall in love is a lot less appealing than the large-family drama unfolding around the Castorinis' kitchen table. [16 Dec 1987, p.C22]","70","93565"
"11871","While Fukunaga creates Agu’s world with an extraordinary attentiveness to detail, he hasn’t quite found a way to approximate the novel’s radically childlike perspective, or to bridge the gap between this child soldier’s psyche and our own.","70","1365050"
"11872","Bound, a diabolically clever caper, isn't nearly so deep as the genre it kids.","70","115736"
"11873","Appreciate it instead as an exceedingly well-crafted fairy tale, alive with eccentric, overdrawn Dickensian characters and irresistibly wholehearted sentiment, and you'll enjoy perhaps the most accomplished and satisfying work of Brooks' career as a middlebrow entertainer.","70","119822"
"11874","Just beneath this movie's gleaming high-end surfaces beats the heart of a classic screwball comedy.","70","1230414"
"11875","The shimmering light and colour, the conflict of cultures, and the emergence of semi-mystic sexual forces in the desert landscape make this as Roeg-ian a film as The Man Who Fell to Earth or Bad Timing.","70","67959"
"11876","Richter's comic genre hybrid comes complete with its own mythology, and team of established superheroes, and is curiously appealing.","70","86856"
"11877","The set pieces, such as an unmasked Spider-Man trying to stop a runaway subway car, are furiously scary, and compensate for all the icky mooning and moping that Peter does whenever he's questioning his gift, which is most of the time.","70","316654"
"11878","The movie may be intellectually sophomoric, dramatically adolescent and morally vacuous, but it's good fun while it lasts.","70","232500"
"11879","It's not a bad movie, but it is very much a transitional one.","70","926084"
"11880","Miss Sloane is a talky, tense political thriller, full of verbal sparring and fiery monologues, undone by a really dumb ending. But that doesn’t mean it isn’t smart for most of its running time.","70","4540710"
"11881","Gilchrist, Emma Roberts and, especially, Zach Galifianakis, give affecting performances, but they are ultimately let down by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck's screenplay.","70","804497"
"11882","Shrewdly taps into the lurking primal terrors of anyone who ever had to sleep with a night light.","70","134847"
"11883","With its spooky atmosphere to spare and a riveting central performance by Kingsley, an actor who manages to elicit both terror and sympathy, I was able to forget all those things, basking in the pleasure of my own goose bumps. So, for an hour and a half, will you.","70","324127"
"11884","Thor delivers the goods so long as butt is being kicked and family conflict is playing out in celestial dimensions, but is less thrilling during the Norse warrior god's rather brief banishment on Earth.","70","800369"
"11885","Captures the way drug addiction gives structure and purpose to aimless lives, and evokes the breathtaking rapture of a fix. All this and a happy ending, too.","70","117951"
"11886","Cody's snappy, spot-on writing and Reitman's clear-eyed direction should suit audiences looking for a black-as-night dramedy with bite.","70","1625346"
"11887","Semi-Pro finds the sweet spot between sports melodrama and parody, and hammers it for 90 diverting minutes.","70","839980"
"11888","If Whiplash doesn't quite hang together, Chazelle has still managed to pack it with some wonderful ideas.","70","2582802"
"11889","A wacky, offbeat piece of filming, charged with vitality, and inventiveness by director Dick Lester.","70","58182"
"11890","Foxtrot is far too interior to be called flashy, but there’s something striking in director Samuel Maoz’s visual confidence, the way he translates his characters’ states of mind into images.","70","6896536"
"11891","The greatest lost opportunity in The Flintstones is that its writers (more than 30) are so faithful to the 60's television series that they failed to add enough updated pop-culture references. The few included are among the film's best jokes.","70","109813"
"11892","While the movie is glorious to watch, it brings no coherence or insight to its two main characters.","70","1560747"
"11893","Here in the rotting depths of pulp horror/adventure territory, that's the entire point of the exercise.","70","120616"
"11894","The sometimes amusing but essentially sordid saga of a male prostitute in Manhattan,...Midnight Cowboy is of the modern moment moderne. It has a hot topical theme; a popular actor from last year’s greatest film comedy; a miscellany of competent bit players, a good deal of both sly and broad humor. If the women object, and some will, that it accords their sex scant courtesy, the story hardly presents males as admirable. Indeed in this film the scenery is lovely and only the human race is vile.","70","64665"
"11895","As popcorn movies go, this is fleet, funny, and even thoughtful: its central question, nicely underplayed by director Peter Berg, is why power and altruism never seem to intersect.","70","448157"
"11896","Basically an excuse for set pieces, some amusing, others overdone.","70","71853"
"11897","Bright could have been something truly special if it had slowed down the pace of its narrative to allow for a fuller exploration of its engaging world.","70","5519340"
"11898","Taken for what it is, Logan's Run delivers a fun ride and a glimpse at another era, even if it's probably not the time frame the producers had in mind.","70","74812"
"11899","The Help is, in some way, crude and obvious, but it opens up a broad new swath of experience on the screen, and parts of it are so moving and well acted that any objections to what's second-rate seem to matter less as the movie goes on. [15 & 22 August 2011, p. 96]","70","1454029"
"11900","If ""Back to the Future"" made you bored and querulous, then the tumbling inventiveness in its sequel may come as a pleasant surprise. Of course, if you were among the 92% of the world who loved the ride in Dr. Emmett Brown's diabolical DeLorean back in 1985, then Part II is your oyster. [22 Nov 1989, p.F1]","70","96874"
"11901","Powerful, depressing and very, very long. At close to three hours, it virtually enslaves an audience, which may be part of the point.","70","120603"
"11902","As The Debt grows more complex and suspenseful, it also becomes more literal, losing some of its dramatic intensity.","70","1226753"
"11903","But there's something missing, something tentative and uncertain. In order to pull off a magic trick, you often have to distract the audience with smooth patter, clever detail or indirection. And this movie tries to play it so pure and unabashed that we can see right up its sleeves. [21 Apr 1989, Calendar, p.6-1]","70","97351"
"11904","It's on the verge of being really good...his narrative peters out without a decent payoff. It's a testament to the rage and anxieties that he has brilliantly tapped into that he can't get away with a subdued conflagration and a lame twist at the end.","70","151804"
"11905","A funny, offbeat superhero flick.","70","411477"
"11906","It’s a lovingly crafted movie, and in many ways a good one, but before that it’s an enraptured piece of old-is-new nostalgia.","70","2771200"
"11907","Roma is no mere movie — it’s a vision, a memory play that unfolds with a gritty and virtuosic time-machine austerity. It’s a Proustian reverie, dreamed and designed down to the last street corner and scuffed piece of furniture. Yet I actually think it’s far from a masterpiece, because as a viewing experience it has a slightly hermetic coffee-table-book purity. Every moment comes at you in the same methodically objective and caressing Zen way.","70","6155172"
"11908","A movie that, if never exactly a cathartic experience, carries you along in its clenched grip with an undeniable power. It’s sad and funny and real.","70","4034228"
"11909","The Beguiled is an atmospheric remake that Sofia Coppola never quite manages to take from languid to lurid.","70","5592248"
"11910","The film is unfortunately about little more than its potentially mind-boggling plot and structure.","70","120382"
"11911","The movie's concerns are obvious, not subtle, and while intellectual energy abounds, laying in subtext, building underlying tension physical and creating visual dynamism are not Schrader's strong suits.","70","6053438"
"11912","All That Jazz is a self-important, egomaniacal, wonderfully choreographed, often compelling film which portrays the energetic life, and preoccupation with death, of a director-choreographer who ultimately suffers a heart attack.","70","78754"
"11913","Inside Llewyn Davis is more deserving of a Grammy than an Oscar. Problematic movie, great album.","70","2042568"
"11914","David Cronenberg's remake of the 1958 horror classic The Fly is not for the squeamish. Casting Jeff Goldblum was a good choice as he brings a quirky, common touch to the spacey scientist role.","70","91064"
"11915","Though not as uproarious as ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin,"" director Miguel Arteta's consistently entertaining white-collar laffer could do for Helms what that film did for Steve Carell.","70","1477837"
"11916","It's all beautiful, all right. But before long I began to feel beaten against the rocks of that beauty -- Finding Nemo smacks of looky-what-I-can-do virtuosity, and after the first 10 minutes or so, it's exhausting.","70","266543"
"11917","Rather than come across as fantastic or dreamlike, the stories have a vivid, hyperreal quality to them.","70","810988"
"11918","As a screenwriter, Ford has made some brave choices in a difficult, complex adaptation. As a director, though, he veers between delivering far too much, and yet not quite enough.","70","4550098"
"11919","Although the film's jabs at TV journalism are nothing new, Carrey brings to the material the sense of someone who's too smart for his work yet loves it -- the essence, perhaps, of being a ham.","70","315327"
"11920","Whether on the high seas or in the Holy Land, the film exhibits a colorful, bouncy sense of the epic (the whale's Jaws-inspired arrival even elicits a few chills), while its saving grace is a consistent sense of its own absurdity.","70","298388"
"11921","John Cleese, Peter Ustinov, Robert Morley, and Muppet creator Jim Henson make cameo appearances, but they're all upstaged by an uncredited Peter Falk, whose monologue on a park bench opposite Kermit the Frog is an exercise in virtuoso daffiness.","70","82474"
"11922","Once Lion's can't-miss conclusion hovers into view, the film's periodic over-dramatization matters less. A story like this is finally impossible to mess up, and pretending otherwise is beside the point.","70","3741834"
"11923","Snyder has set a Sisyphean task for himself. That this very long, very brooding, often exhilarating and sometimes scattered epic succeeds as often it does therefore has to be seen as an achievement.","70","2975590"
"11924","This is wall-to-wall mayhem that dashes from one stylish, splattery, nonsensical set-piece to the next, while the star attacks her silly role with the carnivorous brio of an ocelot clawing a side of ham.","70","432021"
"11925","The film is funny in a way few of these toothless exercises are. The gags aren't exactly clever, but there are a lot of them, and the cutting finds a fast, effective tempo. Joe Biroc's witty cinematography gives the picture an authentically flat, artificial Universal look, and Lloyd Bridges, Peter Graves, Leslie Nielsen, and Robert Stack are around for added iconographical persuasiveness.","70","80339"
"11926","Stuck for years playing young women who are the idealized object of male desire (Portman and Johansson)-- flaw-free and, in Johansson's case, barely conscious -- they come alive in The Other Boleyn Girl, as if being bound up in costumer Sandy Powell's exquisite gowns has freed them from the tighter constraints of their own beauty.","70","467200"
"11927","A smart little teen picture that, for a change, actually features recognizable teens.","70","377092"
"11928","Disclosure is polite pulp fiction, a reasonable rendition of potentially risible material. This lavishly appointed screen version of Michael Crichton's page-turner about sexual harassment and corporate power has what it takes to deliver plenty of year-end bounty into Warner Bros.' coffers, although it might have been even more commercial had it been more shamelessly trashy.","70","109635"
"11929","Like the rest of this new breed of witch story, it's about sisterhood instead of the supreme allure of housewifery, but like all too many witch movies (old and new), it's really just a self-congratulatory paean to banality and shrunken horizons.","70","120791"
"11930","The light ribbing of conspicuous consumption in southern California and the Simon and Garfunkel songs on the sound track both play considerable roles in giving this depthless comedy some bounce. [Review of re-release]","70","61722"
"11931","Still, this strikingly proficient production boasts genuinely scary thrills and first-rate visual and creature effects.","70","120004"
"11932","Wildly uneven, sporadically brilliant, occasionally unbearable, Alex Ross Perry’s sprawling portrait of a self-destructive rock star is carried by a performance by Elisabeth Moss which is turned all the way up to eleven, and beyond.","70","7942742"
"11933","The movie's humor targets both kids and grown-ups with equal success, but, even with the presence of a mustache-fixated monkey, the main attraction here is the movie's vibrant 3-D animation and its perfect storm of foodie-friendly sight gags.","70","844471"
"11934","The ghost story is not half as satisfying as the lovely indie mood piece tucked inside it about a community tending to itself in the wake of a recent wound.","70","164181"
"11935","The best parts of Sparling's script play like an absurdist snuff film.","70","1462758"
"11936","Alicia Vikander (Ex Machina), simultaneously poignant and powerful as Vera Brittain, the writer who fought her way into Oxford then chucked that to go to the front as a nurse, gives another indelible performance.","70","1441953"
"11937","How much intensity and suspense can you drain from a movie about cops and robbers without having the thing collapse into anecdote and whimsy? The Old Man & the Gun kind of does just that, but it’s hard to mind too much.","70","2837574"
"11938","The performances of these actors are reason enough to go. The reason to stay is Lawrence.","70","1045658"
"11939","One of the films best visual treats are its alebrijes, the colorful fantastical creatures from Mexican folk art, rendered here as electrically colored lizards and gryphons that seem to pop off the screen even without the aid of 3-D.","70","2380307"
"11940","It's chock-full of typical Wilder cynicism and the offhand transvestite humor that would reach its apotheosis in Some Like It Hot, but its wit falters as the melodramatic tension builds. The resulting letdown is terrific, but along the way there is some of the funniest men-at-loose-ends interplay that Wilder has ever put on film.","70","46359"
"11941","We may not need as many Austin Powers movies as there are James Bond pictures, but one or two more might be nice.","70","118655"
"11942","The plot is about as ridiculous as you'd expect, but for the most part its absurdities are tolerable.","70","120685"
"11943","Keaton’s hazy wading through Kroc’s McDonald’s takeover is a dynamic performance that drives moral emptiness, but remains so poisonously watchable.","70","4276820"
"11944","As action, it's niftily executed, the suspense neatly built, and the shocks expectedly surprising.","70","4062536"
"11945","David Levien codirected; the fine supporting cast includes Richard Schiff, Jesse Eisenberg, and Danny DeVito.","70","1294213"
"11946","A thoroughly professional comedy, well paced, attractively photographed and smartly acted.","70","307879"
"11947","By and large a notable piece of work, a strong directing debut by actor Ben Affleck that highlights attention-getting performances...But, as adapted from the novel by Dennis Lehane, this brooding, somber film is also ragged around the edges and not without problematic aspects.","70","452623"
"11948","In Commando, the fetching surprise is the glancing humor between the quixotic and larky Rae Dawn Chong and the straight-faced killing machine of Arnold Schwarzenegger. Chong lights up the film like a firefly, Schwarzenegger delivers a certain light touch of his own, the result is palatable action comics.","70","88944"
"11949","This coolly beautiful film is both a superior thriller and an engrossing study of a sociopath's progress.","70","134119"
"11950","This tale of four Mumbai dwellers at a crossroads in their lives owes more to Taiwanese or French auteur cinema than to Satyajit Ray.","70","1433810"
"11951","An amusing look at the perils of film production, Living in Oblivion is an inside joke with a generosity of heart that makes it accessible to anyone who would take an interest.","70","113677"
"11952","A deviously engineered parasite that'll crawl under your skin and live in your nervous system for a while if you give it half a chance.","70","298130"
"11953","Meryl Streep gives a fully realized portrait of British Prime Minister Thatcher in a biopic that values character over context.","70","1007029"
"11954","In all fairness, this swill's swells are in the action: car chases, foot chases, wipeouts, shootouts, brawls and falls -- and they're terrific. Director Kathryn Bigelow pumps up the action to, indeed, full adrenal dimension. [12 July 1991]","70","102685"
"11955","The movie isn't particularly tasteful or finely crafted -- but it grabs you by the jugular, and only during an overcooked climax does it finally relax its grip.","70","340163"
"11956","Ron Howard directed, with outstanding support from Kevin Bacon as Jack Brennan, Nixon's fierce chief of staff.","70","870111"
"11957","Armed or not, Reeves is the weapon that can go off at any time. That's why Street Kings, though it isn't a great movie, is a pretty damn cool Keanu Reeves movie, one that on the Reevesian action scale measures somewhere between ""Whoa"" and ""Wow.""","70","421073"
"11958","Flawed, but fascinating, this somber adaptation of David Guterson's award-winning novel is sometimes sluggish and difficult to follow, but it's also unexpectedly poetic.","70","120834"
"11959","Diaz, costars Jason Segel and Justin Timberlake, and a sharp supporting cast manage to deliver a crappy good time, mercifully devoid of any heart-tugging teacher-student subplots.","70","1284575"
"11960","This movie is so colorful and zippy and packed with outlandish supporting characters, that Hemsworth’s job is relatively easy. He just needs to look great, kick ass, nail the one-liners, and ride off into the sunset (or Avengers: Infinity War, whichever comes first). Thor: Ragnarok is sort of like a giant flatscreen TV hanging on a wall with an enormous hole in the middle of it. The TV is beautiful, but it doesn’t fix the hole. It just covers it up.","70","3501632"
"11961","Tarsem uses the dramatically shallow plot to create a dream world densely packed with images of beauty and terror that cling to the memory even if you don't want them to.","70","209958"
"11962","The perfect summation of Hollywood at this moment - an apotheosis of American male infantilism - and, on its own, a most likable mess.","70","446029"
"11963","There's the usual array of school stereotypes (the lecher, the stoned surfer, the hustler), a rock score, and endless attention to the rituals of dating and mating. Taken purely on this level, it's a relatively witty example of its kind, with an enjoyable performance from Penn as the stoned surfer, and some good lines. But it lacks the frenzied energy which allowed Porky's to beat all competitors in its field.","70","83929"
"11964","Through the actress's effort and her director's generosity, this book about an irresistible man becomes a movie about a remarkable woman. Madison County is Eastwood's gift to women.","70","112579"
"11965","The performances are so plainspoken and direct that they manage to push the material beyond the confines of a mere social-problem tract -- as played by the cast, these characters aren't symbols of inner-city hardship, but people.","70","929632"
"11966","Berg’s blunt, pummeling style offers few nuances and makes no apologies, but his broad brushstrokes have clearly found an ideal canvas in this grimly heroic rendering of hell on earth.","70","1091191"
"11967","Carrey's most satisfying live-action effort since ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.""","70","1068680"
"11968","As spirited and irresistible as the college a cappella craze it celebrates, Pitch Perfect is a cheeky delight.","70","1981677"
"11969","Mr. Johnson throws a lot at the screen, blasted corpses included, yet little here is as initially transfixing as Mr. Gordon-Levitt's mug.","70","1276104"
"11970","It’s a lovely film that requires a little patience and a friendly disposition, and may be too low-impact to thrive amid a summer of grotesquely overengineered sequels.","70","2096673"
"11971","This fairy tale is a weirdly enchanting mixture of old-fashioned whimsy and up-to-the-minute special effects. It brings back the early excitement of reading as a child, when the act of turning pages took on a magical quality. [19 Jul 1984, pg.1]","70","88323"
"11972","As in ""My Favorite Year,"" the laughs all come from seeing a nervous innocent pulled into the star's debauchery, the heart from our growing realization that debauchery is just emptiness with the volume cranked.","70","1226229"
"11973","The Olivier Megaton-directed Colombiana may not be the brainiest of actioners, but one of the merits of producer Luc Besson's latest brainchild is that fanboys worldwide will come away with a scrap of horticultural knowledge as well as a pretty good time.","70","1657507"
"11974","The late-60's Satanic panic and housewifely ennui make for a surprisingly complementary mix of fear and paranoia in Annabelle.","70","3322940"
"11975","A remarkably inventive and audacious film that almost overcomes its flaws.","70","175880"
"11976","What’s frustrating is that with better lead performers and a tighter script, Wingard could have made a great adaptation. Instead it settles when it should have soared.","70","1241317"
"11977","Echoes of James Whale’s Frankenstein movies reverberate through this creepy Canadian sci-fi tale, whose innocent, confused beast is alternately terrifying and pathetic.","70","1017460"
"11978","A kind of bipolar movie, not exactly haha funny but true to life.","70","305206"
"11979","Director Jon Turteltaub has a smooth style suited to classic farce and knows just how to pace the material to accentuate the positive.","70","114924"
"11980","Despite a shaky start and the presence of questionable elements throughout, by the time it arrives at its finale -- which copies Return Of The Jedi's triple-climax structure -- The Phantom Menace has won its place alongside the original Star Wars trilogy.","70","120915"
"11981","This is a great performance from Pacino, who has the good luck here to work with Goldman's mostly wonderful, edgy script, but it might not become a beloved one because the man he plays is such a bitter pill.","70","105323"
"11982","Sporadically entertaining, though it lacks the kind of political urgency and emotional resonance so crucial to many similarly themed '70s movies.","70","120660"
"11983","Though virtually every twist on this emotional roller coaster feels preordained by its architect, the director leaves certain mysteries for the audience to interpret, making for a more open-ended and mature work all around.","70","2343793"
"11984","Even the most hard-hearted critic will let out a sisterhood-is-powerful whoop.","70","278435"

"11986","There's a great deal in black America that has yet to reach the screen, and Lee is a prime candidate, in gift and gall, to help fill the gap. [July 3, 1989]","70","97216"
"11987","Filmmakers pull off a provocative, pulsating update on gangster pics with this action-laden epic about the rise and fall of an inner city crack dealer. Strongest element is the anger and disgust directed squarely at drug dealers.","70","102526"
"11988","Outside of viewing the film as a child or with a group of pals on drunken Saturday night, watching a bunch of loosely stringed sequences of Killer Klowns attacking townsfolk only gets you so far. It's a fun picture. But nothing more.","70","95444"
"11989","Mystery Men is wryly sentimental stuff, but it's also pretty sharp.","70","132347"
"11990","It's the journey that offers the most enjoyment. Well, that and the beauty pageant climax, which I won't spoil here, but is one of the funniest scenes from film in recent memory.","70","449059"
"11991","The kind of minor work that may very well speak greater volumes about (Stone's) thoughts and feelings right now than another masterpiece would.","70","146838"
"11992","The Getaway has several things going for it: Sam Peckinpah's hard-action direction, this time largely channeled into material destruction, although fast-cut human bloodlettings occur frequently enough, and Steve McQueen and Ali MacGraw as stars.","70","68638"
"11993","I'm fully prepared to hear people write off Dear John as corny, sappy, a movie for chicks. But I'd counter that Hallström's old-fashioned idealism about art and emotion is the more important quality shining through Dear John.","70","989757"
"11994","Although it's thoroughly retooled, H.G. Wells's scenario doesn't allow for many soft landings, and the extreme respect for havoc on view quite properly keeps the Spielbergian cutesies to a minimum.","70","407304"
"11995","The primary weakness is in the story itself, which at times seems like mere background for the snappy banter and knowing glances.","70","454848"
"11996","Hardcore blasts along like a supercharged computer-game shoot-em-up, bursting with sick humor and splatterpunk violence.","70","3072482"
"11997","The movie is slick and studiously cool -- with plenty of visual flourishes but not too much soul.","70","240772"
"11998","Represents a failure of nerve: As if Gondry and Kaufman weren't sure that the story of Joel and Clementine would hold us, the doomed couple's unfolding-in-reverse romance is intercut with a subplot filled with zany touches.","70","338013"
"11999","Despite the familiar story arc and MTV visuals, Bendinger puts this across with a certain amount of pizzazz, and the competitive gymnastics are often spectacular.","70","430634"
"12000","Mudbound is full of strong performances, singular moments, and a heavy heart, but it’s an over-ambitious affair that struggles to find the right balance between its many characters.","70","2396589"
"12001","This smooth inside job benefits from heightened bonhomie among the players, fab Euro locations and a diminished obligation to stick to the heist genre boilerplate.","70","349903"
"12002","Despite sliding into melodrama a bit too often, From Here to Eternity remains a decent film due to the strong performances of its Oscar-nominated cast.","70","45793"
"12003","Though I'm not fully convinced that cool and jazzy is the way to go with one of the great civil-rights battles of 20th-century America, George Clooney's elegantly muted take on Edward R. Murrow's fight with Joe McCarthy offers many riches, notably a wicked character study of Murrow and a sexy homage to the pleasures of teamwork when the team is a bunch of smart-ass liberal reporters making common cause against a wannabe dictator.","70","433383"
"12004","An unexpected treat. Bright and perky, cheeky but never mean-spirited.","70","1204342"
"12005","Barkin's succulence and De Niro's showboating lend sizzle and ferocity to the proceedings, but the film draws its poignancy from 18-year-old DiCaprio's performance.","70","108330"
"12006","Spike Lee has grabbed a tiger by the tail in his scabrously risky new comedy, Bamboozled. The wonder is how long he succeeds in hanging on.","70","215545"
"12007","It's all efficiently nerve-jangling, with Tyler and Speedman credibly registering every hue of panic. Still, after such a long, creepy, cannily restrained buildup, it must be said the resolution is rather flat, a full-circle postscript rote.","70","482606"
"12008","As ludicrous as the dialogue by screenwriter/director Walter Hill may be, the film's visual scheme is hypnotic. Dark, moody and muscular, its style gets under your skin even if your brain rebels. [21 Aug 1978, p.66]","70","77474"
"12009","The Farewell is so fixated on its principle problem that it doesn’t allow its story or its characters to veer from it, or find further complexities in it. There’s only so many scenes a story can take of family members trying to keep the truth from grandma before it become less compelling.","70","8637428"
"12010","It's hard to imagine spending $120 million on a film starring a computer-generated mouse -- an actor who barely demands a byte to eat -- but if that's how much it takes to provide innocent enchantment for the global hordes, so be it. This sequel beats the original paws down.","70","243585"
"12011","It's a trim little chiller, with a moderate quota of blood and mayhem, polished performances and smooth direction.","70","68230"
"12012","Though the film's final break-the-bank action sequence in Venice is worth waiting for, Casino Royale's 2-hour, 24-minute running time is long enough to exhaust all but the series' biggest fans.","70","381061"
"12013","If it doesn’t tie many (or any) of these thematic strands with a neat bow, that’s in the nature of a film that chooses raw dramatic power over narrative finesse.","70","8267604"
"12014","When something heartfelt occurs in this movie, you accept it without too much squirming. The disciplined yet intuitive way in which these actors connect is a model of ensemble performance.","70","97239"
"12015","Language this lethal has all but disappeared from the movies, and it's an unmitigated pleasure to observe Caine and Law attack it with such ferocity. Sleuth is nasty fun.","70","857265"
"12016","It lacks the fevered sincerity (and the political timeliness) of Romero's original, but it's tightly scripted, cleverly cast, consistently scary, occasionally funny--everything you could ask from a well-made and completely unnecessary remake.","70","455407"
"12017","John Flynn's crisp, laconic direction and evocative use of Southern Texas locations - the San Antonio area, with particularly effective, sinister excursions to border towns like Del Rio - transorm Rolling Thunder into a more distinctive exploitation movie than it deserves to be. [29 Oct 1977, p.B7]","70","76637"
"12018","If you’re looking for more than laughs, this comedy aspiring to drama takes you only so far.","70","5962210"
"12019","A movie that refuses to kick into gear until it's far too late.","70","119488"
"12020","It's worth seeing at the very least because it is so different from standard Hollywood fare.","70","120824"
"12021","Gwynne is the anchoring presence as a classically dry, laconic New Englander who seems to know some terrible secret. Elliot Goldenthal has composed a helpfully ominous score, as moody as vintage Bernard Herrmann, and Peter Stein's cinematography is superbly varied, from the bright hues of a glossy magazine to the dark shadows of the charnel house. No question about it, Pet Sematary is a handsomely produced film.","70","98084"
"12022","Indeed, the weakness of this picture, from this reviewer's point of view, is the sentimentality of it—its illusory concept of life. Mr. Capra's nice people are charming, his small town is a quite beguiling place and his pattern for solving problems is most optimistic and facile. But somehow they all resemble theatrical attitudes rather than average realities. And Mr. Capra's ""turkey dinners"" philosophy, while emotionally gratifying, doesn't fill the hungry paunch.","70","38650"
"12023","Always crisp and watchable. But as the film's episodic story gradually reveals itself, it ends up too unconvincing and conventional to consistently hold our attention.","70","758774"
"12024","Easy A isn't nearly as good a movie as ""Clueless,"" Ms. Heckerling's contemporary pastiche of the Jane Austen novel ""Emma."" But the one-liner-loaded screenplay has the same insouciant charm.","70","1282140"
"12025","Tornatore has learned much from Fellini--especially in the long shots where someone suddenly appears close up. Let's hope he moves on to his own style. Meanwhile, he has given us a nice bask in Sicilian warmth. [Feb. 19, 1990]","70","95765"
"12026","Tarantino's radical rewriting of the war's ending is audacious and perversely enthralling. But if Inglorious Basterds were about something more than the cinematic thrill of watching Nazis suffer, it could have been a revelation.","70","361748"
"12027","The movie is about preservation and restoration and the power of art. But with what gain in knowledge? It's as if Szpilman had no soul, and no will, apart from an endless desire to tickle the keys. [13 January 2003, p. 90]","70","253474"
"12028","The duo [of Redmayne and Jones] hand-in-hand elevates [The Aeronauts] ... from a flimsy action-adventure to something worth watching on the biggest possible screen, even if it operates on a handful of clichés with little character-based substance to speak of.","70","6141246"
"12029","The Lost City of Z is a finely crafted, elegantly shot, sharply sincere movie that is more absorbing than powerful. It makes no major dramatic missteps, yet it could have used an added dimension — something to make the two-hour-and-20-minute running time feel like a transformative journey rather than an epic anecdotal crusade.","70","1212428"
"12030","There's no denying that Emmerich's film, though a good half hour too long, keeps us watching.","70","187393"
"12031","Sympathy for a pedophile is difficult, but surely comprehension may be possible, and Bacon evokes it.","70","361127"
"12032","Ryan O'Neal stars as a likeable con artist in the Depression midwest, and his real-life daughter, Tatum O'Neal, is outstanding as his nine-year-old partner in flim-flam.","70","70510"
"12033","What propels the film forcefully along is Silverman, who pulls us down so deeply inside Laney’s sickness that everything else seems to fade away (much as it does in the character’s own life).","70","3640682"
"12034","Some of it is a bit too goofy – I could do without the overly slapstick antics of the goofy paintballer who finds out a paintball gun is not much use against Jason – but the comedy is still an appreciated aspect of the film, and it's nice to finally have a Friday the 13th film where someone says they've seen enough horror movies to drive away from the scary guy in the mask standing in the road.","70","91080"
"12035","The epic poem Beowulf gets an imaginative, low-budget workout in this 2005 Icelandic feature by Sturla Gunnarsson.","70","402057"
"12036","Has the manners and the gadgetry of a sci-fi adventure film but is, at heart, an engagingly mean, cruel, nasty, funny send-up of television. It's not quite Network, but then it also doesn't take itself too seriously.","70","93894"
"12037","Jeunet wants us to know that times are hard for dreamers and that one shouldn't pass up a chance for true love. He means it, no doubt, but he doesn't have the simplicity of soul to quite bring off the sentiment. Still, we're charmed by the attempt.","70","211915"
"12038","It isn't surprising that the film was originally based on actors' improvisations, since it creates a universe of tremendously enjoyable characters and allows them plenty of room to roam, but has only the most predictable notion of plot and nothing whatever to say beyond be-yourself pieties.","70","119217"
"12039","Massoud plays Saladin magnetically, and his arrival only illustrates how many opportunities Kingdom misses. Another, better movie would have made him the focus.","70","320661"
"12040","Although The Big Sick breaks new ground as it delves into cultural conflicts, there are patches of the drama that give you pause.","70","5462602"
"12041","The performances lift ""Mini"" out of the gutter of utter cynicism and into the realm of the complex.","70","425253"
"12042","Artistically self-indulgent, if beautifully acted, Light Sleeper isn't aimed at audiences with a hunger for conventional entertainment and upbeat endings -- for Schrader this is an improvement.","70","102307"
"12043","If the movie pushes most of the ugliest behavior off onto side players (like the notorious Suge Knight, played by R. Marcus Taylor), it does for the most part fulfill its mission, breathing life into the origin story of a group whose influence is still being felt.","70","1398426"
"12044","The real summit meeting here may be between the two leads. They're good at their specialties - Reynolds's casual jock studliness and Bateman's nervous white-collar introversion - and they're even better at switching into the other guy's shtick and mannerisms.","70","1488555"
"12045","Mixing horror and comedy while minimizing the gore, writer-director Paul Weitz (About a Boy) serves up a witty adventure fantasy with a tasty dollop of schadenfreude.","70","450405"
"12046","Carpenter creates a vision of the technological future that is both disillusioned and oddly affirmative in its insistence on the unscientific survival of emotional frailty.","70","69945"
"12047","Ephron refreshingly stands out as the nation's foremost advocate of mind-meld. [21 Dec 1998, p. 74]","70","128853"
"12048","Brash, chaotic and jostlingly entertaining.","70","295701"
"12049","The New World takes a shopworn American myth--and runs it through the Malick-izer, making it feel rich, strange, and new. In so doing, the film takes wild liberties with historical accuracy.","70","402399"
"12050","At times, Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile is all about the performances because the movie itself struggles a bit with settling on a tone.","70","2481498"
"12051","It’s the hilarious tumble of words--the sly cultural references, astonishingly creative invective, the veritable arias of profanity--that gives the film an unexpected heft.","70","1226774"
"12052","By contemporary horror standards, the original “Halloween” was actually quite tame, featuring just five (human) deaths, whereas this one more than triples the body count — and it does so with style, borrowing several of Carpenter’s classic devices...before getting into the more prosthetic-heavy mayhem that follows.","70","1502407"
"12053","The film is about how much you're willing to give up for love--a tune that has been played many times before, but never with quite this much slacker brio.","70","118842"
"12054","The resourceful actor (Depp) invigorates Secret Window with a playful personality and wryly humorous aplomb not front-and-center in the script, making the psycho-suspenser more compelling than it might otherwise have been.","70","363988"
"12055","[Smith] also has an uncommonly sure sense of deadpan comic timing. [25 Mar 1994, p.C10]","70","109445"
"12056","Past the first third, Planet of the Apes is entertaining enough, but it stops far too short of being completely seductive.","70","133152"
"12057","For my money, the movie should have given us more of Macy the magical loser and less of Macy the stud muffin.","70","318374"
"12058","Best to savor The Grifters for its handsome design -- the picture looks as clean as a Hockney landscape -- and its juicy performances. [11 Feb 1991]","70","99703"
"12059","It's nice to see Scorsese back in the saddle and a treat to find a cops-and-robbers thriller with some energy and wit. But even so, it's a stylish head rush of a movie that flies by, even at two-and-a-half hours, and keeps turning the knife (and your stomach) up to the final scene.","70","407887"
"12060","Whatever the reason, the energy and hold-onto-your-seat excitement that Muhammad Ali brought to the sports world is oddly absent from this quite accomplished but finally distant film.","70","248667"
"12061","Be forewarned: Scenes of the protagonist learning to swallow the drug pellets will make many viewers queasy. Rarely has the power of suggestion been so unsettling.","70","390221"
"12062","Any sentient viewer will be able to predict every lumpy twist of this ludicrous, fitfully enjoyable movie.","70","1190080"
"12063","At least we know this Allen persona, whatever his current name; the other characters, starting from scratch, don't get much past scratch. Although the picture spreads its attention fairly evenly among them, most of them end up as supporting cast because they are only life-size puppets. [Feb 10, 1986]","70","91167"
"12064","The new film is more an embellishment than an improvement on the snazzy Raiders.","70","87469"
"12065","Oblivion is an absolutely gorgeous film dramatically caught between its aspirations for poetic romanticism and the demands of heavy sci-fi action. After a captivating beginning brimming with mystery and evident ambition, the air gradually seeps out of the balloon that keeps this thinly populated tale aloft, leaving the ultimate impression of a nice try that falls somewhat short of the mark.","70","1483013"
"12066","An utterly formulaic but sweet movie that does what a crowd-pleaser is meant to do.","70","1196956"
"12067","Shot for shot, line and line, it’s an extravagant and witty follow-up, made with the same friendly virtuosic dazzle. Yet this time you can sense just how hard the series’ wizard of a director, James Gunn (now taking off from a script he wrote solo), is working to entertain you. Maybe a little too hard.","70","3896198"
"12068","Branagh’s performance is a triumph of ferocity and feeling that shuns Shakespeare the literary rock star to find the flawed, touchingly human man inside.","70","9206798"
"12069","For his third feature, Richard Kelly delivers neither a triumph (like his first, Donnie Darko) nor a travesty (like his second, Southland Tales) but a sure-handed genre piece that manages to wrap up before its plot mushrooms completely out of control.","70","362478"
"12070","But it's Roberts's memorably comic performance that is the most distinguishing aspect of the movie. As the gawky professional companion, she's ticklishly appealing.","70","100405"
"12071","Lacks an edge of danger or excitement that might have brought the subject alive in more than a cerebral way.","70","180073"
"12072","Delivers enough violence, black humor and even a final reel in 3-D to hit paydirt with horror-starved audiences.","70","101917"
"12073","Francis Coppola's ambitious 1992 version brings back the novel's multiple narrators, leading to a somewhat dispersed and overcrowded story line that remains fascinating and often affecting thanks to all its visual and conceptual energy.","70","103874"
"12074","A densely plotted, visually dynamic post-apocalyptic thriller.","70","114746"
"12075","Cutting to the chase: In terms of summer movie thrills, director John McTiernan's return to the ""Die Hard"" genre (he made the first one) is a triumph.","70","112864"
"12076","Wisely, Hancock has given the film as much humor as heart.","70","878804"
"12077","Truly, you don't have to watch former secret agents relentlessly wipe out villains. But if you want to, you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone better than Washington for the task.","70","455944"
"12078","Cross-species bonding may have its limits, but it’s hard not to find beauty in a boy-meets-beast saga that, by the end, has made it hard to tell which is which.","70","1979388"
"12079","An odd cross between ""Mad Max"" and ""Dragonheart,"" this movie is all borrowed ideas, but it's still trashy fun.","70","253556"
"12080","In Mr. Holland's Opus, Mr. Dreyfuss gives a warm and really touching performance. He's firmly in control of the film's comic moments and just as comfortable delivering the film's calculatingly Capraesque payoff: a good cry.","70","113862"
"12081","After a while, you stop counting the chases -- they just get longer and louder, and it's like watching the revival of a forgotten art form; the fact that it's done with a minimum of special effects makes it all the more stirring.","70","122690"
"12082","Director Jaume Collet-Serra provides a steady flow of suspense and a very Polanski-esque feeling of paranoia.","70","1401152"
"12083","Often in sports, teams run the same plays over and over again, simply because they work. That’s true of The Way Back as well: We appreciate the expert skill, even if we know almost every move by heart.","70","8544498"
"12084","The appealing new kid-on-the-teen-angst block, reverberates with much of the same dark combustible mix of action and romance that's been fueling the ""Twilight"" vampire mega-franchise for a while now.","70","1464540"
"12085","Bloodshot is a trash compactor of a comic-book film, but it’s smart trash, an action matrix that’s fun to plug into.","70","1634106"
"12086","Witness, which is one of the most originally conceived and gracefully made suspense dramas of recent years, to work into edgy juxtaposition the representatives of two subcultures that are ordinarily mutually exclusive.","70","90329"
"12087","Chanodr has said that he wanted to portray the 2008 financial meltdown in all its complexity, assigning everyone a fair share of the blame. But the real strength of his debut feature is how persuasively it depicts the fishbowl world of high finance, whose executives seem incapable of seeing past their towering salaries and privileged lives.","70","1615147"
"12088","Has a routine finish but up to that point is a more than decent thriller--or, given its taut self-containment, a more than decent Hitchcockian ""exercise in suspense.""","70","408790"
"12089","At times, No Strings Attached feels almost shockingly attuned to the particular angst of its time and place.","70","1411238"
"12090","All these years later, the film is far more infuriating than it is exciting.","70","86979"
"12091","Toward the end the freak-show humor begins to yield diminishing returns, but for most of its length this delivers a steady stream of uncomfortable gut laughs.","70","374900"
"12092","Idiocracy, is often stingingly funny -- and an undeserving resident of the summer's-end movie dumping ground.","70","387808"
"12093","Gaudily entertaining, occasionally wearying sequel.","70","458481"
"12094","A polished and satisfying film, yet one that conspicuously feels even more like a consumer product than most Disney revivals of its animated classics.","70","6105098"
"12095","Wall Street isn't a movie to make one think. It simply confirms what we all know we should think, while giving us a tantalizing, Sidney Sheldon-like peek into the boardrooms and bedrooms of the rich and powerful.","70","94291"
"12096","If you can stomach the setup, then the rest is pure revenge-movie gold, as Reeves reminds what a compelling action star he can be, while the guy who served as his stunt double in “The Matrix” makes a remarkably satisfying directorial debut, delivering a clean, efficient and incredibly assured thriller.","70","2911666"
"12097","Needless to say, the plot goes nowhere, but under the pornographic circumstances Figgis, Cage, and Shue all do fine jobs.","70","113627"
"12098","This picture is an odd misadventure: a gigantic enterprise that, despite some quite exceptional filming, is thwarted by its two leading actors.","70","159365"
"12099","It's a quirky film -- extremely profane and violent -- a respite from reverential sigh-fi. It's like visiting the bus depot late at night, and finding you kind of like it. [14 Sept 1984]","70","87995"
"12100","The Ballad of Buster Scruggs will be, at best, a charming footnote in the Coens’ career, a project they enjoyed doing, and possibly even more enjoyed turning into a film so they can keep their résumé free of episodic television.","70","6412452"

"12105","There are many fine performances and sensitive moral issues contained in The Verdict but somehow that isn't enough to make it the compelling film it should be. David Mamet's script [from a novel by Barry Reed] offers little out of the ordinary.","70","84855"

"12107","An urban crime thriller of considerable gravitas.","70","327056"
"12108","Coppola does a fair job of capturing the fish-tank ambience of nocturnal, upscale Tokyo and showing how it feels to be a stranger in that world, and an excellent job of getting the most from her lead actors. Unfortunately, I'm not sure she accomplishes anything else.","70","335266"
"12109","Gold, in a word, is guaranteed at the boxoffice, and this is never less than glittering entertainment, but somehow a certain measure of lead has found its way into the formula.","70","47437"
"12110","Genre comparisons aside, the expert timing and clever setups that were exhilaratingly employed in You’re Next are mostly absent here... Fortunately Barrett and Wingard haven’t lost their ironically humorous touch, as most of the film’s uneasy laughs revolve around upending typical thriller expectations.","70","2980592"

"12114","Crudely made, somewhat overlong and larded with plenty of things that don't work, pic stands as proof positive that a comedy can be far from perfect and still hit the bull's-eye if it delivers when it counts in its big scenes.","70","129387"
"12115","It’s both unfailingly exciting and overly familiar, a restless but risk-averse film that’s a little too content to borrow from what’s worked before.","70","1800241"
"12116","In the finest tradition of adolescent identification figures, he's not only ruthless, dispatching numerous baddies with hair-trigger shots to the head, but profoundly desexualized, brushing off the insistent come-ons of a slinky prostitute (Olga Kurylenko) he's taken under his wing.","70","465494"
"12117","Secretariat was such a commanding presence, the first Triple Crown winner in 25 years, a Time magazine coverboy, the focus of the public's imagination during his pursuit, that any excuse to relive that excitement is worthwhile, and Secretariat gives us one.","70","1028576"
"12118","The peril of making a movie about monochromatic people is that you'll make a monochromatic movie, and Brooks hasn't entirely avoided this problem. Basically, his imagination doesn't include other people: the audience is trapped inside one insanity and starts to crave variety. Still, few comics cut so close to the bone of daily life, and that's to be cherished. [25 Feb 1985, p.85]","70","89504"
"12119","Adams draws on her gift for making each and every moment quiver with discovery. The actress is alive to what’s around her, even when it’s just ordinary, and when it’s extraordinary the inner fervor she communicates is quietly transporting.","70","2543164"

"12126","This somewhat predictable and trend-obsessed comedy about what happens when a woman of a certain age ends up expecting, and unsure of the parentage, is pregnant with comedy gold.","70","1473832"
"12127","The film has a conviction and pulp-adventure integrity that cannot be underestimated. Director Nicholas Meyer keeps his camera hopping and the production has a dark, atmospheric sheen that persistently suggests mystery and danger. Not the best of the series, but a suitable farewell. [6 Dec. 1991]","70","102975"
"12128","Few American filmmakers create female characters as realistically funny, attractively imperfect and flat-out annoying as does Ms. Holofcener, whose features include “Friends With Money” and “Lovely & Amazing.”","70","878835"
"12129","But the actor (Nolte) finds truth in Wade's emotional clumsiness, in the despair of a man who hasn't the tools or the cool to survive. There are too many of these men in life, and not enough films that tell their sad tales.","70","118564"
"12130","How could Frears and his cast rise above the sins of the miniseries? One answer is the force of that cast...The other thing that rescues and refines The Queen is one of the basic bonuses of moviegoing, more familiar of late from documentaries like ""Touching the Void"" and ""Capturing the Friedmans"": you come out arguing.","70","436697"
"12131","As a big-screen thriller, The Girl on a Train is just so-so, but taken as 112 minutes of upscale psychodramatic confessional bad-behavior porn, it generates a voyeuristic zing that’s sure to carry audiences along.","70","3631112"

"12135","Shyamalan often tries too hard, but nobody else can conjure such a sudden flood of worry, or summon so unmistakable a stink of evil, and you come out of Signs, as you did from ""The Sixth Sense,"" in severe need of loud music, bad jokes, and drinks with cherries and umbrellas in them -- anything to waft away the fug of unease. [12 August 2002, p. 82]","70","286106"
"12136","Working as much like a circus ringmaster as a director, Joel Schumacher has brought several critical qualities to the mix, starting with much more of a pop culture sensibility and a sense of fun than Tim Burton, who directed the first two pictures, and he has a stylish visual sensibility as well.","70","112462"
"12137","Well-produced effort is an effective combination of imaginative special effects with the strangeness of author Clive Barker's original conception, on which the characters are based.","70","104409"
"12138","Mr. Scott's affinity for the visceral and strenuous, from ''Alien'' to ''Blade Runner'' to ''White Squall,'' is much more central here than the renegade feminism of his ''Thelma and Louise.'' With punishing intensity, he plunges his audience into the maelstrom of the training program.","70","119173"
"12139","Despite the sense of fatalism and some clumsy turns in Zandvliet’s script, Land Of Mine achieves moments of chilling suspense.","70","3841424"
"12140","The consequence in his denouement falls quite flat for us. But the acting is fair. Mr. Perkins and Miss Leigh perform with verve, and Vera Miles, John Gavin, and Martin Balsam do well enough in other roles.","70","54215"
"12141","It’s a full three-ring affair, complete with puffs of smoke, glitter and grunge, some hocus-pocus, mumbo jumbo and even a dwarf.","70","1054606"
"12142","It’s intelligently stern, storm-gray filmmaking, as we’ve come to expect from Greengrass; if it feels a bit mechanical as well, perhaps this is a near-impossible story to film with both tact and soul.","70","7280898"
"12143","Because of the movie's wonderful shamelessness, its mordantly funny chills and fights are huge turn-ons. A B picture in love with the zest of its comic-book origins, it embodies that medium's pulse-pounding spiritedness and silliness.","70","187738"

"12147","Everything the film has to offer is obvious and on the surface, its pleasures simple and sincere under the attentive guidance of director Jon S. Baird.","70","3385524"
"12148","What makes the movie work are the lively performances, both from the supporting cast and from Cranston, who sheds the mimicry and pontificating of earlier scenes to turn Trumbo into a wry, self-deprecating and somewhat cheeky older man, even if he continued to stand up for what was right.","70","3203606"
"12149","Like HBO’s new Watchmen series, Flanagan’s Doctor Sleep doesn’t simply rehash its source material, and instead uses its characters, setting, and themes in smart and novel ways.","70","5606664"
"12150","A caustic satire masquerading as an action-adventure. Or maybe it's Hollywood escapism masquerading as satire.","70","399295"
"12151","Approaches the serial killer archetype in a tremendously unique way. It turns the old stand-bys on their ears and gives a fresh perspective on the genre.","70","309698"
"12152","Has the elements of an emotionally gripping story. Yet is feels less like a romance than like a coffee-table book celebrating the magic of special effect. [6 July 1994, p. C9]","70","109830"
"12153","In a story driven by questions of loyalty and allegiance, no candidate is identified by party. It's a bipartisan nightmare from which no one escapes unscathed.","70","368008"
"12154","It’s bluntly cheeky, it goes on for too long, but the concept keeps on giving.","70","4501244"
"12155","Worth seeing.","70","186151"
"12156","The movie falls short of greatness, but it compares more than favorably not only with the usual concert film (good as a few of them are) but also with the current love stories on film.","70","75265"
"12157","Midnight has one big problem: Allen hardly gives Gil a perceptive moment. He's awestruck and fumbling - he doesn't possess, to our eyes, the conviction of a writer. But who knows? He's young.","70","1605783"
"12158","This time around, greater attention has been paid to story and character development (while scaling back on all the sight gags) and the substantial results give the ample voice cast and returning director Genndy Tartakovsky more to sink their teeth into, with pleasing results.","70","2510894"
"12159","The results, while occasionally forced, are consistently amusing.","70","1126591"
"12160","The first Kill Bill was nothing but violence--swordfight upon swordfight, till the clanking of steel blades drowned out anything anyone said. The second is its emotional counterpart, the heart without all the blood drained from it.","70","378194"
"12161","The fun here is not so much in the solid if stolid performances from Bale and co-stars Taye Diggs and Emily Watson (gussied up to resemble the Jefferson Airplane–era Grace Slick) or in Wimmer's overpolished plot devices as it is in the production values.","70","238380"
"12162","Donald Pleasence makes a suitably menacing German heavy who appears in film’s final scenes.","70","62512"
"12163","Mighty Joe Young may be the season's most appealing family bet. Certainly, it has an appealing cast.","70","120751"
"12164","The emotional resolutions aren't pat, exactly. But they're not messy either, and for material this inherently volatile, that seems like a cheat.","70","120646"
"12165","The atmosphere is Southern Gothic pure enough to do Carson McCullers proud -- grotesque, sentimental and dankly nasty -- and Thornton manages not to undermine his own writing.","70","117666"
"12166","As black comedies go, Grosse Pointe Blank is just sort of gray.","70","119229"
"12167","The edges are certainly rough; the sound quality changes from line to line and occasionally from word to word. But a lot of that works into the film’s mixed-media approach, and to its overall mood of a life that is rapidly falling apart, held together by a thread that is unraveling before our very eyes.","70","69049"
"12168","It's no masterpiece, but compared to the toothless comedies of its era, its attack on American mythology seems almost worthy of Preston Sturges.","70","85995"
"12169","The film has nothing if not great vitality and an active creative spirit, but it has all been channeled here in a way that comes off as erratic and sometimes ill-judged.","70","2872462"
"12170","Good--sometimes witty—suspense. [28 Jul 1997, p. 69]","70","118571"
"12171","The humor is gross-out but inoffensive, since it's rooted in whimsy, not malice. Smith finesses the sophomore jinx with sophomoric high jinks. [6 Nov 1995]","70","113749"
"12172","It's more conventionally romantic than wildly Romantic--but no less touching for that.","70","810784"
"12173","The film studiously avoids melodrama or theatrics of any sort, enfolding instead as a kind of melancholic tone poem.","70","8019694"
"12174","Despite the familiarity of this setup, Way Back is a charmer, putting refreshingly little emphasis on Duncan's romantic needs and allowing family melodrama to erupt and simmer down without pat resolution.","70","1727388"
"12175","Though Brooks has a broad, crowd-pleasing sensibility, he knows how to appeal to the masses without insulting anyone's intelligence, and that's a rare gift these days.","70","371246"
"12176","Even if the movie ultimately proves less adventurous than its main characters, it has a charm that keeps resurfacing every time you think it’s wandering too far into cutesville.","70","2179116"
"12177","Like all Edgar Wright movies, Baby Driver is a blast, featuring wall-to-wall music and a surfeit of inspired ideas. But it’s also something of a mess, blaring pop tunes of every sort as it lurches between rip-roaring car chases, colorful pre-caper banter, and a twee young-love subplot.","70","3890160"
"12178","It’s hard not to appreciate the astute ways the script captures the moment when carefree childhood turns into the loss of innocence.","70","5112578"
"12179","Busy, busy. That's The Adventures of Tintin boiled down to its essence.","70","983193"
"12180","An exciting thriller that compares favorably with Don Siegel's classic 1956 original.","70","106452"
"12181","Isn't just for music fans. It's more accessible than that, thanks to Joel Schumacher's bright direction and a few storytelling embellishments.","70","293508"
"12182","The movie is clipped, blunt, and grimly realistic. It is practically a POLICIER , although the suspense is mitigated by our knowledge that the investigation will end badly.","70","829459"
"12183","For all its political button pushing, Machete is too preposterous to qualify as satire. The only viewers it is likely to upset are the same kind of people who once claimed that the purple Tinky Winky in ""Teletubbies"" promoted a gay agenda.","70","985694"
"12184","If the circus is a hierarchical pyramid, August is at the very top. It's a part tailor-made for the accomplished Waltz, an Oscar winner for ""Inglourious Basterds,"" and he eats it alive.","70","1067583"
"12185","For almost two hours of car chases and car wrecks and extraordinary animated transformation sequences that meld fluidly with live action, the welcome mat is out for Michael Bay's cheerfully dopey saga.","70","418279"
"12186","In epic battle scenes where he combines breathtaking and fluid choreography, gorgeous 3-D drawings and hundreds of visual effects, director Zack Snyder puts onscreen the seemingly impossible heroism and gore of which Homer sang in ""The Iliad.""","70","416449"
"12187","The Vitaphoned songs and some dialogue have been introduced most adroitly. This in itself is an ambitious move, for in the expression of song the Vitaphone vitalizes the production enormously. The dialogue is not so effective, for it does not always catch the nuances of speech or inflections of the voice so that one is not aware of the mechanical features.","70","18037"
"12188","Steven Spielberg's film climaxes in final 35 minutes with an almost ethereal confrontation with life forms from another world; the first 100 minutes, however, are somewhat redundant in exposition and irritating in tone.","70","75860"
"12189","Jas lots of action, drama, comedy, and corn -- and few pauses, which is striking.","70","244000"
"12190","The film is technically superior, and its look and the strength of its performances (Blanchett, Barraza, and Kikuchi especially) carry it above similar fare.","70","449467"
"12191","It's a pretty shameless outlaw fantasy; the feminist justification that the script provides for the heroines' behavior doesn't make their actions any less preposterous.","70","103074"
"12192","Solomon Kane succeeds by embracing its identity as a straightforward genre exercise, complete with bone-crunching and blood-spurting action. By not aiming for more, it hits its target.","70","970452"
"12193","Terrifying...The less you know going in — and the less energy you spend thinking about it after the fact — the better the movie works, trading on some uncanny combination of Peele’s imagination and our own to suggest a horror infinitely larger and more insidious than the film is capable of representing.","70","6857112"
"12194","Jason Reitman follows his pitch-perfect satire ""Thank You for Smoking"" with another adventurous comedy, though here the cleverness can be grating; the movie is distinctive for its complicated emotions.","70","467406"
"12195","Hard to believe that real emotion was involved anywhere in this story.","70","155267"
"12196","The Road Warrior is ferocious and unpredictable. It's energetic. It's peculiar. It's big and it's dirty. But mostly it's cosmically irrelevant. Hey, but, one thing's for sure, we are driven.","70","82694"
"12197","It’s plain and uncondescending in its re-creation of what it means to be a high-school athlete, of what a country dance hall is like, of the necking in cars and movie houses, and of the desolation that follows high-school graduation.","70","67328"
"12198","Rises above the genre's tired, cookie-cutter competition, presenting familiar elements, such as preternaturally articulate teens preoccupied with virginity, through fresh eyes.","70","1440292"
"12199","A little bit of screwball comedy and a lot of film noir, add a dash of suspense-drama, and half a dozen card tricks too, then you have the recipe for making The Brothers Bloom.","70","844286"
"12200","The Fog is more spooky yarn than streamlined scream machine; it’s the sort of crowd pleaser best enjoyed with an audience.","70","80749"
"12201","Whatever its missteps, this is a film that kids, middle-aged adults and grandparents can all see -- together or separately -- and get something out of in their own ways. There are precious few films that fit this description today and hats off to Spielberg for making one.","70","1568911"
"12202","While the material they’re working with may not be great, it is fun to see Louis-Dreyfus and Ferrell go head-to-head. Maybe they can try doing that again sometime in the future. With a better script.","70","4558376"
"12203","Brad's Status is good enough to make you wish it were even better: tighter, bolder, sharper. But it's a droll, affecting movie — and, in its exploration of a man's fantasies of success and fears of failure, his trudge through the weeds of pessimism toward optimism, a distinctly American one.","70","5884230"
"12204","Keanu Reeves has no peer when it comes to playing these sort of messianic roles -- he infuses them with a Zen blankness and serenity that somehow gets him through even the unlikeliest scenes with a quiet, unassuming dignity.","70","360486"
"12205","Movies that make mental illness cute and poetic tend to give me the heebie-jeebies, and this one doesn't help its case by being evasively vague about the nature of Joon's condition. That said, it should be granted that Benny & Joon is one of the more palatable and inventive examples of this suspect genre, its inherent sappiness leavened by screenwriter Barry Berman's wit and director Jeremiah Chechik's clever use of familiar silent-comedy routines. [26 Apr 1993, p.64]","70","106387"
"12206","Adapted from a comicstrip-turned-graphic novel by Posy Simmonds, which was itself based on Thomas Hardy's ""Far From the Madding Crowd,"" picture represents a satirical but soft-biting swipe at contempo middle-class mores among Blighty's chattering countryside classes.","70","1486190"
"12207","This is a cute, clever ""Superman,"" without the epic audacity of Richard Donner's Supe I, one of the most underrated of movies, despite the $300 million it grossed. [20 June 1983, p.83]","70","86393"
"12208","The movie quotes Baldwin as saying, “Every black person born in America was born on Beale Street,” but this one may as well be located inside a snow globe. In deciding how to translate Baldwin’s prose to the screen, Jenkins may as well have made Allen Ginsberg’s “Howl” as a Douglas Sirk movie (or put Alice Waters’ “The Color Purple” through the Steven Spielberg filter).","70","7125860"
"12209","Two prequels' worth of scene setting pays off in the politically resonant Revenge of the Sith.","70","121766"
"12210","In practice, ""Fiction"" isn't nearly that unusual. Less like ""Adaptation"" than a smarter version of ""Click,"" the picture pleases while remaining unchallenging to a broad audience.","70","420223"
"12211","Wright's performance is the key to a movie that pulses with the sick thrill of historical discovery. The Conspirator reminds us that. when we surrendered so many of our Constitutional rights and judgments after 9/11, it wasn't the first time.","70","968264"
"12212","A good story is a good story, and Eastwood knows how to tell a good story.","70","3513548"
"12213","Dragon Tattoo is too neatly wrapped up, too fastidious to get under your skin and stay there.","70","1568346"
"12214","This is a formula movie but Gilroy is no hack. He hits the expected beats but with more color and depth than you expect.","70","6000478"
"12215","The most nagging impediment to wholehearted acceptance of Tootsie and its little storytelling subterfuges is a failure to recognize the hypocritical aspects of Dorsey's imposture and alleged character improvement. Although Dorsey is supposedly sensitized to the desirability of honesty and consideration in romantic dealings by being forced to seethe on the sidelines while Ron treats Julie badly, the hero never does square things with Sandy, the woman whose trust he betrays in a far more deliberate, systematic fashion. Indeed, it seems downright outrageous for Dorsey to get indignant about Ron's oblivious sort of misbehavior when he's conning Sandy in premeditated ways. [17 Dec 1982, p.F1]","70","84805"
"12216","Debra Granik's Winter's Bone is one of those movies -- like last year's inner-city down-a-thon, ""Precious"" -- that can't quite make a distinction between profundity and plain old bleakness.","70","1399683"
"12217","A likably laid-back spin about the bizarre fate of rock 'n' roll legend Gram Parsons' corpse. Inspired by a true story, pic travels down familiar genre highways, but quirky humor and an apt soundtrack make for a pleasant enough journey.","70","338075"
"12218","Andy Garcia, who first became noticeable in The Untouchables, has seductive strength, homicidal cool. One reason to look forward to Part IV is that he'll fill the center better than Pacino does. [21 Jan 1991, p.26]","70","99674"
"12219","Uneven but entertaining World War II escape drama, which even when it first appeared seemed very old-fashioned. Worth seeing the last half hour, if nothing else, for one of the best stunt sequences in years: McQueen's motor-cycle bid for freedom.","70","57115"
"12220","Armed with a splendid voice cast and a gorgeously-rendered 3D-CG landscape, Dr. Seuss' The Lorax entertains while delivering it's pro-environmental, anti-greed message wrapped in a bright package of primary colors that truly pop.","70","1482459"
"12221","Favreau, who also plays the long-suffering Bobby, mixes elements of drama into this appropriately annoying comedy.","70","227005"
"12222","Why see this film? Partly because of the leading men, but mainly because of a girl. An Australian actress named Angourie Rice plays March’s daughter, Holly, who is thirteen.","70","3799694"
"12223","You'll want to call Slash a ""romantic comedy,"" but that wouldn't do justice to all the social norm blurring that's more about important relationships than a goofy love story.","70","4729990"
"12224","An unnerving but unsatisfying chronicle of a German village filled with hidden cruelty, set on the eve of World War I.","70","1149362"
"12225","This film is the product of artists working at the peak of their powers.","70","128445"
"12226","Sonnenfeld, who demonstrated a knack for Gothic comedy in ""The Addams Family,"" brings the same mischievous gleefulness to this deliriously macabre enterprise.","70","119654"
"12227","First-time feature director Gil Junger gets a lot of laughs in the long setup, but the story eventually reverts to an almost typical high-school romance. Not quite ""Clueless.""","70","147800"
"12228","The movie is booby-trapped with so many loud gags that some of its sneakier humor is nearly lost in the din.","70","166276"
"12229","A political film in the form of a thriller, rather than a garden-variety potboiler gleefully helping itself to stock political tropes from the genre's grab bag.","70","133952"
"12230","Doesn’t have the warmth of the Toy Story pictures, but it still boasts a very entertaining slapstick-farce structure and some neat hairy, oozy, tendrilly creatures.","70","198781"
"12231","To his credit, del Toro does not flinch from the ridiculous. But he is equally sensitive to Hellboy's pulp poetry.","70","167190"
"12232","Better than it might have been, given the limitations of this kind of brand-name filmmaking. Hodges doesn't shirk his duties, and though the film lapses too often into easy facetiousness, much of it feels surprisingly substantial. The action moves smoothly and logically, finding a rhythm that engages your attention despite the patent lack of inspiration and genuine commitment.","70","80745"
"12233","As Ben Wade, gang leader and murderer, he gives an ironic performance, but Crowe’s irony is more intense than other actors’ obsession. He turns the idea of having so few emotions--of being beyond caring--into a bloody joke. He upstages everyone with his laughing eyes.","70","381849"
"12234","Gilliam captures the chaotic visions of debauchery with his trademark aplomb, bringing to life the already trippy patterns of hotel carpets and populating the dark bars of Vegas with genuinely reptilian lounge lizards.","70","120669"
"12235","It’s when the Somalis spirit Phillips away in a closed lifeboat that Captain Phillips becomes a great thriller, in part because Barry Ackroyd’s camera is stuck inside with the characters and its jitters finally seem earned.","70","1535109"
"12236","This revved-up movie version offers a perfect mix of non-stop thrills and clever dialogue, mixed with an engagingly light touch. Nobody is taking anything too seriously here, and that's the fun of it.","70","429493"
"12237","If the second film never reaches the highs of the first -- we have met the players before and there are no new worlds of wonder -- it nonetheless invests moviegoing with a sense of adventure.","70","167261"
"12238","It's enough to send you home with jiggly knees and a tummy ache.","70","391198"
"12239","Ringwald is engaging and credible. For the boys, there's a bright, funny performance by Anthony Michael Hall.","70","88128"
"12240","The idea, in the end, is that even lovable loonies can do a lot of damage.","70","1341167"
"12241","Spanning two decades and a momentous war, Memoirs of a Geisha displays all the pomp and grandeur of an epic, but you wouldn't call it sweeping.","70","397535"
"12242","This might have been a very good movie if it had lost about one of its three hours.","70","112641"
"12243","Jurassic World is pretty good fun. Especially for a here-today, gone-tomorrow summer blockbuster, the picture is better-crafted than it needs to be: If you ignore some extraneous plot threads, and the stop-the-presses revelation that, in the end, “what really matters is family,” Jurassic World hangs together surprisingly well.","70","369610"
"12244","The big problem with this movie is its length. And the story it tells was really better suited for an episode of the series.","70","79945"
"12245","It's basically a mindless paean to goofing off, with interludes of dubious seriousness. [16 June 1986]","70","91042"
"12246","The Book of Eli takes the violent, gritty feel of a spaghetti western, marries it with elements of ""The Road,"" places it in the future and gives it a spiritual twist.","70","1037705"
"12247","What a concept! Mad Max meets The Cosby Show. What a surprise! It works better than a fastidious mind might imagine. One reason is that Mel Gibson himself has been recruited to play Lethal Weapon's lethal weapon, Los Angeles Police Detective Martin Riggs. [23 March 1987, p.86]","70","93409"
"12248","Not particularly nuanced or fine-tuned, The Client, like its source material, is both gimmicky and involving, a fast-moving comic-book version of a comic-book novel. And while Schumacher has not been known as an actor's director, The Client is beefed up by a pair of satisfying star performances.","70","109446"
"12249","Big has a warmhearted sweetness that's invigorating; it makes you want to break out the Legos. It's only near the end of the film, when Hanks has to play the scenes for pathos, that the movie becomes cloying.","70","94737"
"12250","Philip Seymour Hoffman carries the movie. As the CIA operative who hates Communists and his myopic superiors in equal measure, he has a wily, don’t-give-a-shit drive that makes you wish he’d been in Baghdad in 2003.","70","472062"
"12251","As snappy and assured as it is mean-spirited. Its originality extends well beyond the limits of ordinary high school histrionics and into the realm of the genuinely perverse.","70","97493"
"12252","There is a great deal of playfulness between the couple that will touch the romantic in most.","70","1839492"
"12253","While the movie sticks to the familiar Disney formula, the cute sidekicks are less intrusive and the songs are not as overbearing as usual; for the most part, it sustains an enjoyable hum and a simple, delicate glow.","70","120762"
"12254","Cate Blanchett returns to the role that made her a star, and though this sequel to ""Elizabeth"" (1998) is less defensible as history, as florid costume drama it's just as entertaining.","70","414055"
"12255","Keep your eye on Kidman, whose kinky, kittenish performance turns unexpected emotional corners that pull you up short.","70","188453"
"12256","Geographic diffusion aside, Kondracki's fact-based thriller remains somewhat focused on its grim subject, though its principled bid to allure and enlighten the VOD-surfing masses results in a surplus of Hollywood-style eye candy and narrative formula.","70","896872"
"12257","The action varies from a show-stopping train/bus wreck of Schwarzeneggerian proportions, to some more ironically staged pursuits which throw a welcome dash of ""Tom and Jerry"" into the mix.","70","106977"
"12258","It’s not a perfect film, but it’s definitely the Soder-side I prefer.","70","1130080"
"12259","Glossy, witty eye candy with some moderately chewy stuff in the middle. This lavish, exhaustingly kinetic film is smarter than you might expect, and at the same time dumber than it could be. It's an impressive product: a triumph of cloning that almost convinces you that it possesses a soul.","70","399201"
"12260","I wasn't bored at all by this, and Angela Bassett's action-hero charisma often blew me away, but fans of Bigelow at her best (e.g., Near Dark) may be put off by the movie's calculation, which doesn't always fit with its intellectual pretensions.","70","114558"
"12261","The real-life tale of a group of female machinists who took on the Ford Motor Co. in England and earned equal pay for women gets a rousing and entertaining telling in Nigel Cole's crowd-pleasing Made in Dagenham.","70","1371155"
"12262","Strouse’s deft script and Krasinki’s game direction upend a host of familiar moments in ways that are fresh and unexpected — if sometimes overly broad. The terrific cast doesn’t hurt.","70","3714720"
"12263","Crisply stylish and suspenseful, making brilliant use of optical special effects, Predator is one of Schwarzenegger's best.","70","93773"
"12264","For all his genre-hopping and shape-shifting Spielberg seems to have become too big to tell small stories, which is one reason why the film sputters on one too many false endings.","70","264464"
"12265","Where the original gave you something to chew on, the sequel is more interested in chewing on you.","70","463854"
"12266","This multiplicity--of people, stories, settings--is both the weakness and strength of the film. It is not easy to follow all the various threads, to get the pith of every scene. Still, this very abundance gives the whole picture a sense of authority.","70","365737"
"12267","The results are unique in the contemporary cinema -- behavioral honesty and intensity raised to a flash point. If this be comedy, it is so only in the nominal sense that no one dies at the end of the picture.","70","1045670"
"12268","A provocative premise, virtuoso direction and two dazzling lead performances go a long way toward offsetting a lack of dramatic structure and a sense of when to quit in Face/Off.","70","119094"
"12269","The briskness of The Sessions works against it: It lacks the fullness of the best films of its ilk, chief among them Jim Sheridan's ""My Left Foot."" But Lewin lets his eye wander pleasingly.","70","1866249"
"12270","No matter what you've been used to, Idaho is something completely different, a film that manages to confound all expectations, even the ones it sets up itself. [18 Oct 1991]","70","102494"
"12271","Virtually bursts with visual goodies, and writer-director Stephen Sommers scarcely allows the actors, or the audience, a moment to take a breath during the nonstop action of the final hour.","70","209163"
"12272","Gudegast's twisty, turny tale of heists and homies is an action-packed romp with a good sense of humor and self-awareness. It's rendered with a startling attention to detail, but one has to wonder if with that detail, he can't quite see the forest for the trees.","70","1259528"
"12273","On the scale that ranges from implausibly entertaining to entertainingly implausible, Skyscraper comfortably falls toward the compulsively over-the-top end, generating thrills by straining credibility at every turn, relying on Johnson’s invaluable ability to engage the audience while defying physics, common sense, and the sheer limits of human stamina.","70","5758778"
"12274","While the plot can sometimes feel too lightweight for feature length, with a score by composer Laurent Perez del Mar (Now or Never) that tends to overdo it on the gushy side, The Red Turtle benefits from the beautiful animation work of Dudok de Wit and his team.","70","3666024"
"12275","The reassuring familiarity of Abrams’ approach has its limitations: Marvelous as it is to catch up with Han Solo, Leia and the rest of the gang, fan service takes priority here over a somewhat thin, derivative story that, despite the presence of two appealing new stars, doesn’t exactly fire the imagination anew.","70","2488496"
"12276","Though Wan is stepping away from horror, at least for now, to direct the next The Fast And The Furious sequel, the latest Insidious entry suggests he’s a long way from running out of new tricks, or at least finding infinite variations on old ones.","70","2226417"
"12277","Deep, it's not. But it is glossy, funny and well-performed. And like other ensemble movies, it's stronger on character than plot as it shifts from relationship to relationship to draw a picture of the whole. [28 June 1985, p.27]","70","90060"
"12278","Silverado looks great and moves fast. Mr. Kasdan has packed his action well against the fearsomely long, dusty stretches of Western plain. [11 Jul 1985, p.1]","70","90022"
"12279","As writer and director, Schnabel should be commended for avoiding Hollywood's biopic cliches about artists, as Basquiat's meteoric rise to fame and tragic death at the age of 27 would have fit perfectly the timeworn formula.","70","115632"
"12280","Credit first-time director Jeremiah S. Chechik for his sure-handed rein on Christmas Vacation's polar opposites of sentimental and satirical sides. It makes for a smooth-sledding comedy.","70","97958"
"12281","One senses that The Guard is McDonagh's eulogy for the brusque, warts-and-all character of a passing generation of tough, working-class Irishmen, much as Clint Eastwood's ""Gran Torino"" was for vintage Americanism.","70","1540133"
"12282","McCarten’s scene writing is tart and efficient and Wright infuses the drama with unquestioned energy. But this is a film in which every point and meaning is hit directly on the nose.","70","4555426"
"12283","You'll laugh a lot, but not without a sense of animal desperation.","70","219822"
"12284","Big Trouble is plenty conscious of its silliness, which it embraces fully. It sets up its own parameters of ridiculousness and then runs with them, winking a little, but sticking to its story.","70","90728"
"12285","This is a fairly low-keyed comedy, but a grown-up dropping in on it can appreciate its lack of frenzy, its fundamental good nature, as easily as its core audience will. It isn’t exactly a gem, but as zircons go, it’ll do.","70","800039"
"12286","The Maze Runner only answers some of the questions it so marvelously sets up. And while I probably now know too much about the story for it to work a similar magic next time, I find myself genuinely anticipating the next one.","70","1790864"
"12287","Mamet's jabs at Tinseltown's silken ruthlessness are quietly pointed, and the ensemble cast -- even the brittle and sometimes annoying Pidgeon (Mamet's wife) -- is brilliant.","70","120202"
"12288","Moves along at a clip and provides a terrific action lead for Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnson.","70","351977"
"12289","A polished genre piece with superior fright elements.","70","119345"
"12290","The film lives up to its own characters’ thesis: that disability need not define a person — or even the film about that person.","70","5716464"
"12291","Its pleasures and charms lie in its very crudeness, in the way the characters' thoughts begin in their d---s and spill out of their mouths, completely bypassing their brains.","70","829482"
"12292","Taken--in the hands of director Pierre Morel (District B13), with Neeson in nearly every shot--works like gangbusters. The Frenchies have made the filet mignon of meathead vigilante movies.","70","936501"
"12293","It's an interesting story, more accessible to non-Trekkers than previous entries.","70","120844"
"12294","This special-effects-crammed action blockbuster is not rocket science. It's more like rocket fun.","70","167456"
"12295","An impressive, thought-provoking astro-adventure that benefits from the biggest screen available.","70","1731141"
"12296","So Beginners might sound insufferable, but it isn't - or at least not completely. Mills's second feature (after Thumbsucker) has way too many quirks for its own good, although it also flaunts a rare freedom to jump back and forth in time.","70","1532503"
"12297","No stranger man - not even Nixon - has ever been at the center of an American epic.","70","1616195"
"12298","Norton, too, keeps us guessing, though his pseudo-tough-guy line readings (and cornrowed hair) are initially distracting. But his scenes with De Niro -- who fills every twitch or glance with Jack's long-buried guilt -- are the guts of the movie.","70","1423995"
"12299","This amiable romantic comedy benefits from its stellar ensemble.","70","1001508"
"12300","The Craft is well-made with a hard-driving pace. It places heavy demands on its four lead actresses, who come through in impressive fashion. Director and co-writer Andrew Fleming makes sure he and his stars deliver the goods. [03 May 1996, p.F16]","70","115963"
"12301","Although pic’s basic premise is repellent – recently dead bodies are resurrected and begin killing human beings in order to eat their flesh – it is in execution that the film distastefully excels.","70","63350"
"12302","Megamind is snappy good fun.","70","1001526"
"12303","The abstraction of the approach perhaps limits the scope of Miles Ahead as an acting showcase, though in Cheadle's fully inhabited characterization, he nails the subject's soft, nicotine-scratched rasp and his eccentric irritability and paranoia with discerning understatement.","70","790770"
"12304","For all its swaggering bravado, Pacino's turn in Two For The Money is the reverse image of his ""Devil's Advocate"" character: Instead of the omniscient, all-powerful operator he presents himself as, he's a gambler grasping at a lifestyle that's always just beyond his means.","70","417217"
"12305","The Christian themes of forgiveness and sacrifice are tastefully conveyed, and the opening sequence of Nazi bombs falling on London, an event only alluded to in the book, helps dramatize Lewis's fascination with power.","70","363771"
"12306","There’s so much high-voltage fun running throughout this comic sci-fantasy -- engineered gleefully by director Luc Besson -- you’re hard-pressed to be unaffected.","70","119116"
"12307","The picture is deeply weird, with an entrancement factor almost entirely dependent on the performance of Michael Parks.","70","3099498"
"12308","Like an old airplane (or spacecraft) jerry-rigged from scrap pieces and made air-worthy again, Super 8 has been patched together with 30-year-old spare parts to provide an enjoyable ride of its own.","70","1650062"
"12309","Impressive, big-scale scenes, such as a train derailment from a snow-covered bridge. And the vocal performances of Ryan and Cusack give us a real sense of romance.","70","118617"
"12310","That's all it has --comedy-- but that's enough. [29 May 1929, p.14]","70","19777"
"12311","Saving Mr. Banks does not strictly hew to the historical record where the eventual resolution of this conflict is concerned, but it is easy to accept this fictionalizing as part of the price to be paid for Thompson's engaging performance.","70","2140373"
"12312","Gradually, though, it wins you over with endearing performances and a clarity of purpose. If that sounds faintly patronizing, it isn’t meant to.","70","4513316"
"12313","This is the sort of funny, humane, honorable story that families need more of, though viewers of any age should be hooked by the mystery surrounding the brothers' riches.","70","327137"
"12314","All four of the roles are written with pungency. There is even an implication that the two adults realize the triteness of the situation and that they--the characters, not Baumbach--want to speak from inner sources, not from a script. Baumbach pulls this off with some sting and wit.","70","367089"
"12315","The present film-makers have retained the essences of the plot and characters but have moved the ambience toward the next stylistic era, romanticism.","70","414387"
"12316","You're entertained continuously, though you don't feel the queasy, childish dread that is part of the dirty kick of the horror genre.","70","82533"
"12317","Willis' John McClane, with that sly, sideways smile, is like an old acquaintance you don't mind running into. He may be older and balder, but he's none the worse for the wear. And he can still take a punch.","70","337978"
"12318","Funny, touching, and ultimately tremendously buoyant--reflecting the optimism engendered by the short-lived 1980s economic boom—Working Girl is a ""feel good"" movie with some intelligence.","70","96463"
"12319","That film does have its attractions, notably in its two solid leads and standout support from Mr. Pearce.","70","1504320"
"12320","At least the 20 people who saw it with me -- found it hysterically funny. On the other hand, they all seemed pretty stoned.","70","267913"
"12321","I mean Serenity no disrespect when I say it's enjoyably junky.","70","379786"
"12322","The Lobster is more than a satire on the dating game. It digs deeper, needling at the status of our most tender emotions.","70","3464902"
"12323","It's a testament to Norton's utter immersion in the role that he can even halfway connect the dots between this fundamentally sweet, brainy kid and the magnetic, white trash monster who'll haunt our minds long after the movie's liberal pieties fade into static.","70","120586"
"12324","Pfeiffer is a knockout; she’s the sexiest presence in movies today and an exceptional comic and dramatic actress, to boot.","70","97322"
"12325","Like Gervais, the audience wants to see a struggle, which here comes down to whether unvarnished honesty or random acts of compassionate deceit will win the day. That alone makes for entertainingly high stakes.","70","1058017"
"12326","Like the sequinned, simpering erotic dancers it spotlights, Hustlers is a lot smarter than it initially looks. Given a story about a gang of larcenous strippers, audiences might expect little more than dirty jokes and steamy sex. But this slyly feminist movie pushes empowerment, too; it’s a film about being in control, not losing it.","70","5503686"
"12327","Revolutionary Road isn't a great movie -- it lacks the full, soul-crushing force of the novel -- but what works in it works so well, and is so tricky to pull off, that you can't help but admire it.","70","959337"
"12328","While constantly eventful and a feast for the eyes, it's also notably more somber than its predecessors. But just when it might seem about to become too grim, Robert Downey Jr. rides to the rescue with an inspired serio-comic performance that reminds you how good he can be.","70","4154796"
"12329","Though Training Day doesn't resolve itself as well as it deserves and ends strictly cops-and-robbers style, it's given us some great acting and something to ponder. Not every cop show can lay claim to that.","70","139654"
"12330","Tomlin confirms herself as a star whenever she gets the material, and Dolly Parton's dolliness is very winning, but it's easy to forget that Jane Fonda is around - she seems to get lost in the woodwork. The director, Colin Higgins, is a young fossil who sets up flaccid, hand-me-down gags as if they were hilarious, and damned if the audience doesn't laugh.","70","80319"
"12331","For fans of science fiction...Galaxy Quest is a sweet, funny valentine to their obsessiveness.","70","177789"
"12332","Apart from scenes with Leslie Mann as a mother who propagates the wisdom of The Secret (she’d be too heavy-handed for a Disney Channel sitcom), The Bling Ring is enjoyable. And it’s always easy on the eyes.","70","2132285"
"12333","Keaton's so good you almost forget how wonderful Downey is as Steven Schwimmer.","70","425055"
"12334","The picture feels weirdly, and disappointingly, disjointed, something that starts out as poetry and ends as product.","70","910970"
"12335","A ruthlessly efficient stalk-and-slash machine.","70","452702"
"12336","It's a lively, often astute piece of marital sociology wrapped up in an action frolic involving an extremely average New Jersey couple.","70","1279935"
"12337","Though it's a little slow to start and some of the humor clunks, the film features a wholesome charm, some truly dazzling effects (the Lincoln Memorial alone is worth it), and enough mild, parent-nip in-jokes to keep all but the stone-hearted happy.","70","1078912"
"12338","Tongue-in-cheek dialogue, inventive slapstick and fight sequences, and luminous production design make this a treat.","70","441773"
"12339","Crowe's tantalizing film sticks with you.","70","259711"
"12340","Compared to Escape From New York, the weapons are bigger and the violence is more extensive, although it’s toned down by today’s excessive standards. There are also greater special effects this time, involving holograms and nuclear-powered submarines. But Escape From L.A. is more enjoyable in a playful way.","70","116225"
"12341","This delightful, fast-paced and entirely fictional imagining of Shakespeare's life during the writing of ""Romeo and Juliet"" brims with witticisms predicated on the determination to have a rollicking good time exploring the link between libido and creativity.","70","138097"
"12342","Wilde delivers a confident feature directorial debut, mixing humour, embarrassment and poignancy to crowd-pleasing effect.","70","1489887"
"12343","But the way that this picture has been so widely ravened up and drooled over verges on the disgusting. Pulp Fiction nourishes, abets, cultural slumming. [14 Nov 1994]","70","110912"
"12344","Someone should confiscate Mann's synthesizer. Just when a scene starts rolling along, this synth beat fades in and destroys the mood.","70","113277"
"12345","Admirably ambitious and utterly unsparing, but as credible as the arc of Danny's odyssey is in itself, the all-important need to evoke a profound sense of the enigmatic and paradoxical in relation to Danny's fate has eluded Bean.","70","247199"
"12346","There's no honor among thieves, but there is dignity in Focus's ambition. And if the final film is more vodka ad than all-time classic, there's still no shame in pouring another cocktail and rewinding the tape.","70","2381941"
"12347","Both director Terence Fisher as well as the cast have taken a serious approach to the macabre theme that adds up to lotsa tension and suspense.","70","51554"
"12348","The news is, sadly, all too consumed still with crime story post-mortems about “good kids” who screw up, but at least American Animals wants to leave you wondering about how we tell stories, and whose we tell, rather than simply satisfied you saw one told well.","70","6212478"
"12349","Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner are wonderful together. They look great when they're in bed together and they look even better when they're fighting. Throw Danny DeVito into the mix and you've got a very enjoyable, watchable trio of heroes.","70","88011"
"12350","Michael Sheen, who adds to his gallery of public figures (Tony Blair, David Frost) with a sharp performance here as the legendary UK soccer coach Brian Clough.","70","1226271"
"12351","The surprise in Jaws 2 is that, given the givens, it came out as well as it did. For me, in terms of sheer visceral zapping, it’s better than the first time around (or under).","70","77766"
"12352","A British romantic comedy with not much inside its pretty head but the spinning out of an ancient Hollywood riddle.","70","109831"
"12353","The film's spooky atmosphere is accentuated by Anthony B. Richmond's cinematography and Philip Glass's score. Ms. Madsen's performance is a lot more enterprising than what the material requires; the same can be said for Mr. Rose's direction. [16 Oct 1992, p.C10]","70","103919"
"12354","In the end, I Think We’re Alone Now isn’t very interested in constructing a mythology or exploring the apocalypse itself. It’s more of a relationship drama, one that works as a showcase for two great performances against a post-apocalyptic backdrop that ups the stakes","70","6169694"
"12355","Hacksaw Ridge is the work of a director possessed by the reality of violence as an unholy yet unavoidable truth.","70","2119532"
"12356","Marshall hasn’t made one of the great movie musicals here, but he hasn’t bungled it either — far from it.","70","2180411"
"12357","One leaves the film neither hugely thrilled nor greatly awed, but with a pleasant sense of having caught up with old friends and found them to be just fine, pretty much the way one hoped they would turn out in later life.","70","84726"
"12358","Beneath its movie star clowning, its awful-but-relatable heroine and its lightweight gags, Burn After Reading poses an implicit challenge to its viewers: Can you figure out why this comedy isn't very funny? Could that be because its central proposition is that the people in the theater are just as stupid, just as gullible, just as eager to be deceived as the people on the screen?","70","887883"
"12359","Loveless gives us a multicourse meal of social ills, too dispersed to feel like a thesis, yet too chilly to feel like a raw, unbridled tantrum.","70","6304162"
"12360","Stephen King reportedly loathed the liberties Kubrick and co-writer Diane Johnson took with his story, but King's ur-villain, the emasculated husband from hell, has never been more clearly presented on-screen.","70","81505"
"12361","There’s ample amusement in the twists, betrayals and revelations that unspool. But Bad Times never really transcends the inherent limitations of its setup; it’s fun, but fleeting.","70","6628394"
"12362","A dumbed-down adaptation of Michael Crichton's techno-novel on the dangers of dinosaur cloning, it's not Spielberg at the top of his game, but it's dino-mite just the same.","70","107290"
"12363","A celebration of buddies and butts, it's an unconventionally structured, wonderfully acted group portrait of the regulars at a Brooklyn cigar store.","70","114478"
"12364","The writing and editing aren’t up to the task of retrofitting Alcott’s straightforward narrative with a sophisticated chronology and rob it of dramatic tension in the process.","70","3281548"
"12365","For all of its departures, Luhrmann's largely successful reinterpretation is far from irreverent. He takes liberties with the world, but never the words of this achingly beautiful love story.","70","117509"

"12367","Where The Matrix was a heady cocktail of gnostic Zen Philip K. Dick cyberpunk '60s psychedelic bull, well spiked with high-octane digitally driven Hong Kong action pyrotechnics, those elements reloaded soon separate out. The refreshing draft of effervescent movie magic leaves a sludgy sediment of metaphysics.","70","234215"
"12368","Rips out at least one dimension to reduce everything to archetypal good guys and bad guys, or bad guy and worse guys.","70","120784"
"12369","Mr. Seagal is effective for both his novelty value and his ability to be both literally and figuratively disarming. And the film itself is a lively one for its genre, ambitious enough to do more than simply string fight scenes together.","70","99739"
"12370","The film, executive-produced by Guillermo del Toro, hinges on a first-rate performance by Basinger, who imbues Della with a fire that makes the film's basic thesis -- both the domestic sphere and the larger world are dangerous places for women -- seem something more than boilerplate.","70","887971"
"12371","Passion, obsession, mad love, the violent clash of insider and outsider-all these themes, plus the performances, are rich enough to carry us past that wounded climax, if not to carry the movie past the fatal attractions of the big box-office cliche. [18 Sep 1987, p.1]","70","93010"
"12372","A borderline pretentious, overly inflated picture.","70","140352"
"12373","Helgeland has given us an impressive introduction to one of the most important men in U.S. history. But you can’t help wanting more.","70","453562"
"12374","Once again, the three young leads give committed performances, with Lautner's character allowed a larger share of the spotlight this time around.","70","1259571"
"12375","Some of the gags are side-splitters, some just sit on the screen. But the film would have to be a great deal worse to prevent Naked Gun die-hards from lining up. [18 Mar 1994, p.F6]","70","110622"
"12376","It's Vincent D'Onofrio as Pooh-Bear, a drug lord who's snorted so much meth his nose had to be replaced by a plastic one, who kicks ass.","70","235737"
"12377","Irredeemable, and yet, the movie, written by Pete Goldfinger and Josh Stolberg, is too funny and the filmmaking too self-aware to be truly offensive.","70","464154"
"12378","If you’re looking for less fright and more fun as you tick down the Halloween season, or if you just want to see John Carpenter tell terrible puns while forcing severed heads to make-out, Body Bags is for you.","70","106449"
"12379","A great true story is telescoped down to a merely good one in Unbroken. After a dynamite first half-hour, Angelina Jolie's accomplished second outing as a director slowly looses steam.","70","1809398"
"12380","Brings things to an almost cheesy conclusion. Given the gripping, dark elements that creator George Lucas introduced in the two previous films, the third movie’s outcome smacks of PG-rated populism rather than artistic fulfillment. But the experience is still highly entertaining. [Special Edition]","70","86190"
"12381","There are few surprises here.... But that’s okay, because we’re in it for the ride, the company, and the pure pleasure of watching these women, and the actresses playing them, embrace an independence Hollywood doles out too grudgingly.","70","3564472"
"12382","Eclipse is the least laughable installment yet in the series, and director David Slade efficiently delivers the fan service that Twihards require.","70","1325004"
"12383","The narrative conceit requires a fair amount of indulgence as the story progresses, but the fleeting, incomplete glimpses of the monster early on prove the old dictum of B movie auteur Val Lewton that a momentary image can have greater impact than a prolonged one.","70","1060277"
"12384","The result isn’t uplifting in the least. But it’s deliciously frightening, a cautionary tale for the careless and a horror film that posits a world devoid of any real goodness.","70","5715874"
"12385","The results are about as naughty as that sounds (not very), but it also makes for a fairly giggling good time.","70","1632708"
"12386","There's a rampant looseness to this movie, and it's subversively liberating.","70","145660"
"12387","An accomplished, intelligent, often exciting piece of work, but I can't help wishing that Haggis had figured out how to make it more fun. [22 Nov. 2010, p. 140]","70","1458175"
"12388","To the extent that Michelle Williams' multilayered interpretation of Marilyn Monroe serves as its raison d'etre, My Week With Marilyn succeeds stunningly.","70","1655420"
"12389","John Hillcoat's The Road is an honorable adaptation of a piece of pulp fiction disguised as high art; it a has more directness and more integrity than its source material, the 2006 novel by Cormac McCarthy.","70","898367"
"12390","Even though Single White Female is more second-rate, knife-stabbing psycho drivel, it's no pain to sit through. It looks great, for one thing. It has two fabulous faces -- Bridget Fonda and Jennifer Jason Leigh. It's also funny, sexy, suspenseful and, yes, utterly stupid.","70","105414"
"12391","While The Lighthouse didn’t hit me as deeply or as sharply as The Witch, the fact that such a strange feature can still be produced with so few concessions to the mainstream, and that it’s coming to theaters, feels like a breath of fresh air — albeit one cut with at least a few Willem Dafoe farts.","70","7984734"
"12392","It turns out to be absolutely delightful.","70","1638355"
"12393","This charmer about late middle-aged renaissance is pertinent for these times and a perfect summer comedy for grown-ups looking to escape robots and superheroes.","70","1583420"
"12394","Possesses sufficient intrigue to hook audiences and keep them on board much of the way.","70","217869"
"12395","Outland is what most people mean when they talk about good escapist entertainment. It won't enlarge one's perceptions of life by a single millimeter, but neither does it make one feel like an idiot for enjoying it so much.","70","82869"
"12396","A restless, rangy and frankly enjoyable genre-juggler that combines melodrama, comedy and more noir-hued darkness than ever before, the picture is held together by the extraordinary force of Almodovar’s cinematic personality.","70","913425"
"12397","Somewhat tonally inconsistent; following the social comedy of Monte Carlo and suspense of Manderley, the pace slackens in the crime procedural of the final half-hour, which is all tell and no show. Still, Hitchcock shows superb technical control and attends to his trademark motifs, from monstrous mother figures to the fetishisation of clothing (strong foreshadowings of ‘Vertigo’).","70","32976"
"12398","Overly precious but undeniably affecting, Me And Earl And The Dying Girl travels into familiar dramatic terrain — the offbeat coming-of-age story, as well as the terminal-cancer drama — to deliver something that feels handmade and also heartfelt.","70","2582496"
"12399","The Last of the Mohicans comes at you like a tomahawk. Hard, fast and brutal, it slashes at your throat and just about leaves you for dead. Undeniably exciting as this definitely is, however, its impact comes at the expense of some of the gentler virtues, qualities that even top-drawer barn-burners really shouldn't ignore.","70","104691"
"12400","One can't escape the nagging feeling that the film doesn't dig deeply enough into its real-life hero. The film doesn't explore all those ""whys"" and ""whats.""","70","1586752"
"12401","Setting most of the action in a mocked-up theater emphasizes the performance aspects of the characters' behavior, a strategy enhanced by lead thesp Keira Knightley's willingness to let her neurotic Anna appear less sympathetic than in previous incarnations.","70","1781769"
"12402","Cronenberg made a movie called “The Dead Zone,” and I sometimes wonder whether, for all his formal brilliance, he has ever torn himself away from that locked-in, airless state of mind. You walk out of Eastern Promises feeling spooked and sullied, as if waking from a noisome dream.","70","765443"
"12403","Like the best noirs, Brick is a triumph of attitude, and there's no arguing that its brand of deadpan cool is precisely unique.","70","393109"
"12404","The film does look beautiful, and there's enough intrigue to inspire anyone to learn more about such a complex, fascinating life. It just would have been nice to see a little more of that complexity onscreen.","70","962736"
"12405","We only see what Loung sees, feel what she experiences but through her ordeal there develops an emotional connection to a country undergoing some of its darkest hours.","70","4882376"
"12406","The director of ""Gallipoli"" and ""The Year of Living Dangerously"" has muffled the rage and darkness of his best work in favor of an antiquated pleasingness. Master and Commander is a too-comfy classic.","70","311113"
"12407","Successfully brings to the big screen those no-brainer nerds who have brought laughter to living rooms around the world for nearly four years.","70","115641"
"12408","A jolly mess of a movie. Overplotted, choppy, and contrived, it nonetheless has a curious vitality that makes you wonder where McDonagh will go next.","70","780536"
"12409","Best of all are the supporting players. Everett (who played the Prince of Wales in ""The Madness of King George"") is smartly urbane, giving a polished refinement to the stereotypical ""gay best buddy'' role.","70","119738"
"12410","Aquaman is imaginatively ambitious superhero cinema with no rules, which is more positive than negative as Wan's vision is realized like an underwater laser light spectacle that the DCEU so desperately needs right now.","70","1477834"
"12411","This cartoonishly violent exercise in cinematic hero worship comes at the audience with chambers loaded and fires off rounds too rapidly to worry about how vapid it all is.","70","4158096"
"12412","The three icons ham it up, do some verbal towel-snapping and have fun, which also describes most of this self-conscious adventure movie.","70","1320253"
"12413","The Last Temptation of Christ, Martin Scorsese's provocative, punishing, weirdly brilliant adaptation of Nikos Kazantzakis' novel, has a feverish intensity. And undeniably, there's a prodigious greatness on display here. But just as undeniably, it is failed work.","70","95497"
"12414","A stellar, warmly persuasive starring turn by Sally Hawkins as crippled, self-taught painter Maud Lewis is the raison d'etre of Maudie.","70","3721954"
"12415","Wind River adds up, and skillfully, but in the end it’s not all that exciting. It’s a vision of the new American despair — not an inner-city movie, but an inner-wilderness movie — and it could have used another twist or two.","70","5362988"
"12416","While the women's battle with the cave creatures has fine jump-from-your-seat moments, it gradually becomes the same chase flick horror fans have seen dozens of times. OK, it's a darn good one in most respects.","70","435625"
"12417","The movie does achieve something nearly impossible: Someone who doesn't even like the sport may care about Billy Beane and the 2002 Oakland Athletics.","70","1210166"
"12418","Jarmusch keeps the picture formal and cool, and it has an odd, nonchalant charm; it's fun. But it's softhearted fun--shaggy-dog minimalism--and it doesn't have enough ideas (or laughs) for its 90-minute length.","70","88184"
"12419","The Wile E. Coyote fatalities are fun, but it's that repetitive moment of horror that holds this bipolar stunt together: Cruise, bug-eyed and gasping for breath as he shakes off his fear and grimly prepares for the next suicide mission.","70","1631867"
"12420","Likable, lightweight, absurdist comedy.","70","1234548"
"12421","Robin Hood is no classic, but if it sometimes seems like it’s trying to be “Baz Luhrmann’s Robin Hood,” more power to it. The movie is a diverting live-wire lark — one that, for my money, gets closer to the spirit of what Robin Hood is about than the logy 1991 Kevin Costner version or the dismal 2010 Russell Crowe version.","70","4532826"
"12422","No matter how frenzied and elaborate and sometimes distracting his technique may be, Luhrmann's personal connection and commitment to the material remains palpable, which makes for a film that, most of the time, feels vibrantly alive while remaining quite faithful to the spirit, if not the letter or the tone, of its source.","70","1343092"
"12423","It’s basically espionage adventure, but with a science fiction backbone: Nolan ups the ante on “Mission: Impossible” by making the impossibility not just physical but quantum physical. And he goes about it expertly, bullishly and with giddily perverse intent to bewilder.","70","6723592"
"12424","A Hitchcockian thriller with a bit of ""Unstoppable"" and a little ""Unknown,"" Source Code is a pulse-pounding flick.","70","945513"
"12425","A solid, minor entry in the annals of Boston crime drama. Not as florid as ""The Departed"" or as sadly soulful as ""The Friends of Eddie Coyle"" - or even as sticky and gamy as ""Gone Baby Gone,"" Mr. Affleck's previous film.","70","840361"
"12426","Brightburn doesn't take its satire to any kind of satisfying extreme – although a mid-credits stinger does include a larger joke at work – but as a superhero murder thriller, it is perfectly entertaining.","71","7752126"
"12427","The film's details are spot-on, its tone ludicrously ironic, and its casting deft.","71","144084"
"12428","The film itself is sly and smug in kind, fleetingly enjoyable for all of its old-school showmanship and high-tech hokiness.","72","1670345"
"12429","The film’s finely tuned middle act, a fast-paced and quick-witted journey into (possible) madness, eventually gives way to an unsettlingly over the top final section that relies far too much on larger setpieces and supposed “big scares” that are never as good as the smaller, weirder stuff.","72","2870612"
"12430","Once all these characters come together, the film’s manic, disjointed first act settles in for some seriously rollicking ’80s-esque hijinks, replete with brand new Predator aliens and a healthy dose of worldbuilding that touches on today’s every hot button issue, from climate change to genetic modifications to anti-ableism that’s actually probably just ableism.","72","3829266"
"12431","The convincing child cast carries the film when the scares start to feel redundant.","72","1396484"
"12432","Like its predecessors, Bill & Ted Face the Music is ultimately just friendly fluff, but Winter and Reeves are charming together, and the need for Bill and Ted to grow up a little helps give the film a backbone.","72","1086064"
"12433","The scares are some of the best the entire series has to offer, and on that criteria alone it can probably be considered a success. But there’s no escaping the fact that as a standalone film, Covenant is wanting, neither truly making its own thematic points nor carving out its own unique place in the legacy of the franchise.","72","2316204"
"12434","Wonder Woman won’t reinvent the superhero franchise, or the origin story. But it does show how compelling they can still be, when someone is allowed to do them right.","72","451279"
"12435","This humor could be profoundly ugly, given how it's aimed at reducing other people's grotesque deaths to punchlines. But first-time director Tim Miller keeps the tone light — in his hands, Deadpool is more a snickering, naughty nut than an authentic sociopath.","72","1431045"
"12436","If the film’s direction is workmanlike and the writers’ plotting flimsy, then the better to focus on the cast. They’re a joy to watch together.","72","2531344"
"12437","If you can overlook the three or four endings of Bridge of Spies, each more overdone than the last, there’s a lot to like here.","72","3682448"
"12438","Wingard’s Death Note moves like a bullet and doles out practical gore and overheated melodrama in equal measure.","72","1241317"
"12439","The movie is funny/sad without ever necessarily being revelatory or incisive. For better or worse, it’s very much like its protagonists: deeply, reliably nice. In fact, what’s most radical about The Big Sick is its optimistic insistence that a little niceness can make all the difference.","72","5462602"
"12440","A truly entertaining and dizzyingly wild horror film.","72","2980592"
"12441","While American Hustle succeeds when it comes to casting and characters, it’s dragged down by a murky and poorly-paced narrative.","72","1800241"
"12442","Machete works because at no time does it ever ask the audience to take any of this too seriously, yet the nudges and winks are never so forceful that it feels like it's begging for your laughter.","72","985694"
"12443","There’s a tipping point at which comedy goes from black to bilious, and that’s a balancing act that The Nice Guys doesn’t always nail. The laughs from this frequently entertaining action comedy get stuck in the throat, keeping this altogether good movie from being a great one.","72","3799694"
"12444","For a genre that so often sacrifices character development and smaller narrative developments, the majority of The Maze Runner feels quite refreshing and worth the navigation.","72","1790864"
"12445","Triple Frontier features a cool cast and a gruesome story about greed, but it fails to capitalize on its own premise.","72","1488606"
"12446","It's only appropriate that the film is as competent, efficient, and mildly dull as the people it celebrates.","73","3263904"
"12447","Proof of Life won't hold your heart hostage for very long after it's over, but here's looking at Russell Crowe -- he's the real deal, sweetheart.","73","228750"
"12448","The Meg is a big, dumb shark movie that takes itself a little too seriously, and that’s the point. Jason Statham is perfect for the material, the shark attacks are entertainingly broad, and the supporting cast brings personality to the otherwise straightforward script.","73","4779682"
"12449","Covenant’s framework and exciting action put enough new spins on the series’ most reliable touchstones that the cast is able to carry it through to a satisfying end.","73","2316204"
"12450","Ultimately, I Don’t Feel at Home in This World feels like an ambitious experiment from a first-time filmmaker trying everything at once. It’s scattershot, but it’s also goofy, creepy, and just wild surprising fun.","73","5710514"
"12451","Hawkins’ performance in Maudie is as indelible a feat of psychological imagination as it is of physical dedication.","73","3721954"
"12452","Chandor’s film isn’t malleable enough to fit into the moral grey zones into which it ventures; it’s too battle-hardened for that. But it’s an ambitious and absorbing above-average thriller with something deeper on its mind, making this sometimes somber journey worthwhile.","73","1488606"
"12453","Green Book may supply little in the way of meaningful commentary on racial dynamics either in the 1960s or today. But thanks to Mortensen and Ali, it’s a perfectly pleasant way to spend two hours.","74","6966692"
"12454","There's talent to burn in this movie. But the flame is cold.","74","163988"
"12455","Strangely, what it most lacks is the genuine tension found in the first ""Mission""'s signature set pieces.","74","120755"
"12456","Snowpiercer is bold and brutal and committed, but no setting, no matter how inventive or beautiful, can compensate for storytelling that strains plausibility even as it batters your senses and sensibilities.","74","1706620"
"12457","A near-perfect confection, a beautifully executed Hollywood all-you-can-eat salad bar of glamour, plot twists, breathtaking Mediterranean vistas, and jazz.","74","134119"
"12458","Seems truncated, incomplete -- mostly because the patented Shyamalan twist is revealed in the dénouement, not the climax.","74","217869"
"12459","The real drama -- and poetry -- in 8 Mile are in those fiery face-offs, the hip-hop battles, as Jimmy rat-tat-tats his rap in deft flashes of spontaneous combustion.","75","298203"
"12460","It's back in a handsome new black-and-white print, and it's still powerful stuff -- you can see why Pauline Kael wrote that it was ""probably the only film that has ever made middle-class audiences believe in the necessity of bombing innocent people.""","75","58946"
"12461","Rather than trying to overwhelm viewers by overloading the senses, John Carter's effects strive to create something new using as their foundation a book that's fired imaginations for the past century.","75","401729"
"12462","The General's Daughter is for all those who enjoy mystery/thrillers that neither attempt to break new ground nor are afraid to employ familiar plot devices.","75","144214"
"12463","With its fine-tuned comic timing and feeling of constant action, Into the Spider-Verse is downright invigorating, and that’s evident even before it gets to its dazzling, dimensional-colliding climax.","75","4633694"
"12464","It's hokey, implausible and packed with red herrings, and yet it's a lot of fun.","75","139668"
"12465","Half as long and twice as much fun as the self-important ""Lincoln,"" Roger Michell's charming sex-and-politics comedy Hyde Park on Hudson is basically a frothy tabloid take on presidential history. And for my money, that's a good thing in a season filled with puffed-up prestige pictures.","75","1477855"
"12466","Ishtar is a good movie, but you can't help but wonder if, lurking somewhere in those cans of outtakes, there isn't a great movie, too. [15 May 1987]","75","93278"
"12467","Green Book is an on-the-nose social commentary that is told with such craftsmanship, earnestness, and comedic expertise that you’re still excited to go along for the ride.","75","6966692"
"12468","Like any artist, Miller has the right to reinvent herself, but we don’t need one more director of winsome, Sundance-ready rom-coms. That said, as winsome, Sundance-ready rom-coms go, Maggie’s Plan is a pretty winning one.","75","3471098"
"12469","May be well-trod territory, but worth a walk down the movie aisle.","75","1041829"
"12470","This is a jolly, slapstick comedy, lacking the almost eerie humanity that infused the earlier “Toy Story” sagas, and happier with action and jokes than with characters and emotions.","75","435761"
"12471","Concussion is a good movie that could have been great without trying so hard to be great.","75","3322364"
"12472","Disarmingly sweet.","75","1748122"
"12473","This movie lets you feel something. Like George's house, if not his life, it's built well and full of heart.","75","264796"
"12474","You may hate All The Money In The World, and you would be well within your rights to feel that way, but there’s no denying that the film is bold and ballsy.","75","5294550"
"12475","Sufficiently resembles the first film that the heartiest fans should be content.","75","383574"
"12476","Bond is back, and so is high-octane entertainment.","75","1074638"
"12477","Judge still comes up with enough laughs to deserve our attention. He is helped more than a little by hilarious work from supporting players Kristen Wiig, David Koechner, J.K. Simmons, and Dustin Milligan.","75","1225822"
"12478","For all the film's popped eyeballs and severed limbs, Beetlejuice retains an innocence that makes the grotesque humor very appealing. Burton has captured the sweet ghoulishness of a 12-year-old pouring over horror comics, dreaming of the greatest Halloween costume ever invented. [30 Mar 1988]","75","94721"
"12479","Succeeds, just barely, on the good will of its stars and the sumptuousness of its Western locations.","75","110478"
"12480","When the cast and their director are really cooking, they conjure a bipolar sense of high school-age emotion -- and use it to fuel outrageous fantasy.","75","145487"
"12481","So beautifully directed, so pleasurable to watch and so thoughtfully put together, it's a disappointment when you realize, halfway through, that the movie is going to fall way short of a masterpiece.","75","362227"
"12482","Now You See Me, which is essentially an ""Ocean’s"" movie recast with illusionists, demands a kind of childlike fascination with swindles, and a willingness to be hoodwinked along with the characters. Walk in with those expectations and it won’t be hard to see the appeal of this ludicrous but spirited caper, which has nearly as many rug-pulls as game movie stars.","75","1670345"
"12483","Jeunet manages a terrific pass in an extended underwater sequence, but, beyond that, he runs out of ideas as we run out of patience.","75","118583"
"12484","The Last Black Man plays like a poetic portrait, part tender ode and part cartography of lived experience, bringing a nuanced and hard-earned perspective to the screen.","75","4353250"
"12485","After 23 years and three attempts, Predators finally delivers a solid sequel to the Arnold Schwarzenegger B-movie classic.","75","1424381"
"12486","Wittily written and deliciously acted, Lonergan's debut film is a clear cut above the average.","75","203230"
"12487","In The Haunting, the moviemakers succeed in something very difficult: creating a haunted house with real personality and terror. [23 July 1999, p.A]","75","171363"
"12488","The reason why the movie works at all is Hanks.","75","3263904"
"12489","A roaring old-school action adventure for kids, with as many mythical beasts as a year at Hogwarts and a healthy dose of smiting without the crazed bloodlust of “300.”","75","800320"
"12490","A horrifying thriller, smart and tightly told, and merciless.","75","880578"
"12491","One such paradox, which Into the Wild doesn't note, is that those who flee civilization more often than not bring it with them. The bus in which Christopher McCandless died is now a tourist destination.","75","758758"
"12492","A demonstration of the way time can sometimes give us a break.","75","107048"
"12493","Suggests a summit meeting between ''The Princess Bride'' and ''Bridget Jones's Diary,'' it has a decided charm of its own.","75","126029"
"12494","The Exorcist's strength is that it places character development on the same level as the horror elements, but it is not a ground-breaking motion picture. It is also too long, with a setup that could have accomplished the job with equal effectiveness in about 2/3 the time. [2000 re-release]","75","70047"
"12495","Sneakily funny and hopelessly romantic, Reality Bites speaks with the distinctive, ironic voice that marks it as The Graduate of Generation X. [18 Feb 1994, p.03]","75","110950"
"12496","Though Craven satirizes horror cliches, he also knows how to cut through them and do new things. Throughout, the action comes unexpectedly and quickly.","75","120082"
"12497","This is not for the Merchant-Ivory crowd, but action fans will feel their pulses quicken.","75","165929"
"12498","Delivers a few pleasant surprises, including a smart story -- a reverse-E.T. riff that plops an American astronaut down in a world of just-like-us-only-green creatures -- and clever characters.","75","762125"
"12499","Scrooged doesn't pack the wallop of ""A Christmas Carol"" - you won't cry or walk out resolving to become a better person - but it's a funny and imaginative high-class effort. Best of all, it stars Bill Murray, who has only to raise an eyebrow to get laughs. [23 Nov 1988, p.E1]","75","96061"
"12500","The good news is that it comes closer than any of its predecessors, hitting the mark or coming close to it on almost all fronts. With ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"" being split into two films, the final installment stands an excellent chance of getting it right.","75","417741"
"12501","Best of all, there's just the pleasure of seeing something that's both fantastic to the eye and emotionally dimensional. This is how to make action movies.","75","372784"
"12502","For all the hundreds of thousands of dollars being thrown around, The Gambler is much closer to a friendly game of poker with some loquacious, quick-witted friends than a glimpse at the gambling world’s dark underbelly. Neither is it a preachy moral tale.","75","2039393"
"12503","Rise of the Guardians is enjoyable as a stand-alone adventure - not groundbreaking animation but a solidly entertaining 90 minutes for older children and adults.","75","1446192"
"12504","The way-too-neat ending of The Brave One especially strains credulity, but it's worth watching for Foster's fiercely arresting performance.","75","476964"
"12505","These are characters so repulsive that it's hard to care what happens to them, but it's to the credit of a superb cast that you do end up caring.","75","964517"
"12506","There's something beautiful about a well-made tragic love story. It may not be as uplifting as one with a happy ending, but it's more cathartic.","75","375154"
"12507","It is a ridiculously entertaining (and often just plain ridiculous) monster-robot movie that plays like a gigantic version of that “Rock ’Em, Sock ’Em Robots” game from the 1960s, combined with the cheesy wonderfulness (or should it be wonderful cheesiness?) of black-and-white Japanese monster movies from the 1950s.","75","1663662"
"12508","What's exciting is that the Sprechers have delved into territory that is normally the domain of literature and have emerged with a film that's neither overly literary nor simplistic.","75","268690"
"12509","The film is a savage but funny, unsparing but oddly kindly, examination of a hell-bent-for-a-bigger-bank-account brand of behavior that was celebrated in the fifties, tolerated in the early sixties, rejected in the late sixties, tolerated again in the seventies, and is once again being celebrated in the eighties. [06 Mar 1987]","75","94155"
"12510","The actual animating force of this lushly told bedtime story is Del Toro’s swooning cinephilia, splashed across every available screen-within-the-screen, and expressed through black-and-white musical fantasy sequences, lavish throwback period detail, and the accordion whine of Alexandre Desplat’s wistful cornball score.","75","5580390"
"12511","Eckhart shows a new kind of foreboding anger. He's powerful as a man who will do anything to crack the ice.","75","935075"
"12512","Watching Phoenix in his last film, I couldn't help thinking of James Dean's final performance, as the cranky loner, Jett Rink, in ""Giant."" [12 Nov 1993, p.D3]","75","108327"
"12513","Land of the Dead is a horror flick, but not a screamy one -- the booming soundtrack pumps up the drama, and the gore induces squirms, but zombies more titillate than anything.","75","418819"
"12514","A great movie? Hardly. Stallone as the next Brando? You've got to be kidding. A nice little fantasy picture? Maybe. That's the hype and reality of Rocky, the flatout schmaltzy saga of a Philadelphia club boxer who, on New Year's Day of our Bicentennial Year, gets a chance to fight for the heavyweight championship of the world. . . .","75","75148"
"12515","It offers a powerful metaphor for the manner in which we carry the memories of our departed inside ourselves.","75","4302938"
"12516","The suspense is as tingly as jalapenos on the tongue.","75","230600"
"12517","Horrible Bosses 2 is harsh and tasteless, not to mention broad and shameless, but that’s not a bad thing in this case. Softness and good taste, as well as restraint and carefulness, are the enemies of comedy, and “Horrible Bosses 2” is a very funny movie.","75","2170439"
"12518","Ultimately affecting mix 'n' match weeper.","75","167404"
"12519","Playing like a slightly more reflective B-side to the director's greatest hits, his style in this film isn’t for the more cerebral audiences. But for the viewer who relates to family dysfunction, its maddening contradictions and its mercurial tenor, Joy can be painfully funny, engaging and full of relatable heartache.","75","2446980"
"12520","With its mix of true-blood romance and full-moon madness, Let Me In should hasten the twilight of the twerpy pretenders.","75","1228987"
"12521","Ultimately, this film is more interesting than rousing; missing is a John Ford-ian wealth of idiosyncratic characters. [9 Nov 1990, Life, 4D]","75","99348"
"12522","Original, it's not. Exciting, it is. This jacked-up B-movie hybrid of ""Black Hawk Down"" and ""War of the Worlds"" is a modest but crafty triumph of tension over good sense and cliche.","75","1217613"
"12523","The special effects are pretty special for the most part, and the movie seems only about 10 minutes too long. [23 June 1989, p.1D]","75","97523"
"12524","The performances reveal precisely what Rivette wants to reveal, which is to say, in conventional psychological terms, not a great deal.","75","781435"
"12525","A wild ride through nonstop visual effects yet a warm wallow in the cinema of the dumbed-down.","75","120738"
"12526","Whatever the case, We Own The Night plays like a masterpiece because it skillfully appropriates actual masterpieces, not because it earns the label on its own merits.","75","498399"
"12527","One of the major problems facing Hollywood today is the lack of will and energy to make movies that can charm youngsters without boring their parents. Popeye is an important contribution toward the solution. It's not a sophisticated film. But it's a gratifyingly engaging one. [12 Dec 1980, p.1]","75","81353"
"12528","The only thing missing from Salt is Lotte Lenya's Rosa Klebb with her steel blade-tipped shoes from ""From Russia With Love."" Come to think of it, the Russian defector here does indeed kill with steel-blade shoes. Nice touch.","75","944835"
"12529","They turn more of the story over to the comic relief, the dopey tow truck Tow Mater, and get a sillier, more kid-friendly movie out of it. Yes, Cars 2 is better than ""Cars.""","75","1216475"
"12530","Kasdan ends up with an intellectually dishonest movie about intellectual dishonesty.","75","140397"
"12531","Children of Men has some magnificent moments of moviemaking and is thoroughly infused with just the atmosphere Cuaron has aimed for. But it's so streamlined in its storytelling and unvarying in its tone that it's more deadening than transporting.","75","206634"
"12532","Listen to me: trash can surprise you. So don't get all elitist about the so-called cheap thrills in Mr. Brooks.","75","780571"
"12533","Hilarious pseudo-documentary spoof of a British rock group that was so on-target in its satire, many viewers took it for the real thing.","75","88258"
"12534","It's smart, strange, unpredictable, and defies the formulas that typically define this sort of motion picture.","75","311289"
"12535","A smart, brisk, but extremely thoughtful hybrid of star-vehicle and resonant depiction of right-now America.","75","1193138"
"12536","The Rookie is ""Rudy"" in a baseball uniform.","75","265662"
"12537","Some girls fight over men. Ballerinas fight over parts. But the occasional brilliance of Black Swan is that it's a one-way fight. Nina battles herself.","75","947798"
"12538","The Butler carries an authenticity that sustains it through its cloying stretches.","75","1327773"
"12539","The pervasive but almost offhand menace is supplied by Mitchell’s impeccable, widescreen mise-en-scène; the ordinary dread he locates in an unglamorous, mundane L.A.; and the way even the film’s comedy seems perched on the edge of unease.","75","5691670"
"12540","It's refreshingly unformulaic, but a rambling mess. It's also tremendously funny.","75","1201167"
"12541","A clever, heart-pounding thriller, and a welcome return to form for the director.","75","971209"
"12542","It’s a charming, whimsical and ever-so-slight film, a bit of an over-reach but pleasant enough, even when it falls short.","75","359950"
"12543","Apart from its star, though, Emma may be the least convincing Austen adaptation so far.","75","116191"
"12544","Murphy shows an easy versatility, going for guffaws one minute and pulling off a grinner the next. [04 Dec 1992]","75","104114"
"12545","Franklin juggles it all with wit and style, and suddenly you feel fine that this is only Mosley's first Easy Rawlins novel. Several more are just waiting to be adapted.","75","112857"
"12546","It's one of those movies that are unfortunately so technically well done, it's hard to tune out on the senseless story.","75","163579"
"12547","The Imitation Game is entertaining and well-crafted, but one still can’t help but wish the drama had a bit more bite and nerve throughout.","75","2084970"
"12548","All the movie’s finer points — of audience response, of interaction, of the dances between people — are conveyed with a specificity so expert that it seems offhand.","75","1967614"
"12549","Bourne it is not, but the twists come with enough regularity to keep the squishier parts of the plot from mucking up the works.","75","3062096"
"12550","Coil up with a tub of popcorn, get a stranglehold on your soda - this is a creepy, action-packed boat ride down a jungle river with lots of huge snakes dropping by for man-sized snacks.","75","118615"
"12551","Though the original is superior, this glossy entertainment is far more popular with audiences. [25 Dec 1998, p.13]","75","49470"
"12552","Amour is also unforgettable and one of a kind, two hours of torment that, in the end, you will probably not regret.","75","1602620"
"12553","John Travolta may stand out as a plus-size laundress who is hesitant, drab and retiring, but Hairspray is a consistently flashy, rousing and rambunctious movie spectacle.","75","427327"
"12554","The movie is surprisingly strong despite its potentially flaky plot, combining '80s-style humor with a sincere romantic story.","75","120888"
"12555","For most of the film, the non-stop action is totally involving, and Stallone gives a dynamic performance that could break him out of the Rocky groove. [11 Oct 1982]","75","83944"
"12556","The film never quite hits a sure-footed stride. The fictional love story stays fictional. But ''Pearl Harbor'' delivers the main event.","75","213149"
"12557","Ignoring these lapses in logic, The Parent Trap' is hugely enter taining and more relevant than most family entertainment.","75","120783"
"12558","Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton are so good in Something's Gotta Give, it's a shame writer-director Nancy Meyers couldn't rein herself in a little more.","75","337741"
"12559","The fast-talking Tucker and quick-kicking Chan are a surprisingly good team that manages to deliver a fun combination of highly choreographed action and comedy.","75","120812"
"12560","With all this going for it, Vicky Cristina Barcelona should be better than it is. But there's something intriguing going on here. It's a movie about the sacrifices that people make to be happy.","75","497465"
"12561","Feature debuts don't come much better than director Robert Harmon and screenwriter Eric Red's sleek, dream-like thriller about a naïve college boy who crosses paths with devil in the flesh after taking a wrong turn on some lost highway.","75","91209"
"12562","Coppola is unable to draw all this together and make it work on the level of simple, absorbing narrative. The stunning text of ""The Godfather"" is replaced in Part II with prologues, epilogues, footnotes, and good intentions.","75","71562"
"12563","The vision of director Alex Proyas lifts this film above its sad history.","75","109506"
"12564","Joel and Ethan Coen's idiosyncrasies elevate the film above the level of a mere creative exercise.","75","475290"
"12565","Hidden Figures is feel-good history, but it works, and it works on behalf of heroes from a cinematically under-served community. These smart accomplished women had the right stuff, and so does this movie.","75","4846340"
"12566","The masterful ten-minute gallery set piece, for instance, is first positioned as a scene of meditation as she absentmindedly gazes around the room, looking back and forth between the paintings in the room and the people around her until Pino Donaggio’s serenely swirling score ebbs and flows with her own rising passions.","75","80661"
"12567","Despite a formidable effort and occasional grace, there's something cowardly about Braveheart -- it's an aspiring giant with a diminutive soul.","75","112573"
"12568","Rosemary Clooney (that's Danny Ocean's aunt) steals the show as one half of a sister act accompanying the boys on their yuletide misadventures. The real highlight, of course, is the Irving Berlin score. [24 Dec 2004, p.39]","75","47673"
"12569","The script by Tim Herlihy and Timothy Dowling gets relaxed, throwaway laughs, even if it doesn’t always hold together.","75","2120120"
"12570","If you can stomach the hard-R rating, this is a smart, sexy and funny sprint.","75","479884"
"12571","I, Tonya may be more of a pop-biographical exercise than a deep interrogation, but there’s a resonance to the synergy between its star and its subject: one famous female artist reclaiming her professional narrative by playing another who never quite could.","75","5580036"
"12572","Streep is simply amazing to behold, an actress who invests every fiber of her being -- every gesture, every inflection, every strand of hair -- into her performance.","75","166943"
"12573","The result is a slight, handcrafted indie that’s sweet, skewed, and feels a bit like a skit stretched out to feature length.","75","5805752"
"12574","It’s a miniature art history lesson that is also a rapt communion between two people who, at least in this moment, are joined in the ecstasy of creation.","75","1990217"
"12575","A multi-colored downer fantasy which combines bursts of imagination with a bleak worldview, resulting in something that rarely feels mainstream.","75","1335975"
"12576","MacGruber is crude. It’s obscene. The dialogue is puerile and the jokes adolescent. And for the most part, it's hilarious: a bawdy riot drunk on impropriety, which is why the movie works.","75","1470023"
"12577","The Martian is the most purely enjoyable picture Scott has made in years. The streamlined narrative and the film’s consistent pacing, aided by a cast who don’t make a wrongfooted move, makes for easy popcorn entertainment.","75","3659388"
"12578","Empire of the Sun remains a solidly engaging story of heroism in the face of adversity, as filtered through the eyes of a boy obsessed with planes and flight.","75","92965"
"12579","Tomas Alfredson's Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy may be the best possible movie version of the story, but it illustrates that the big screen is not the ideal medium for a tale of this complexity.","75","1340800"
"12580","Energetic, provocative.","75","181984"
"12581","Irresistible, campy fun.","75","160127"
"12582","Impressive yet always self-conscious, Perdition has more class and less sass than any movie in a while.","75","257044"
"12583","The movie remains an embodiment of Spielberg's commercially cunning brand of clankingly retro filmmaking, despite the wit and charm brought to their Spiel-speak dialogue by the talented young performers, The Goonies is less a movie than an entertainment machine. [7 Jun 1985, p.E1]","75","89218"
"12584","Most contemporary sci-fi movies come on with all CGI-guns blazing, trying to blow the roof off the theater. Moon settles for trying to blow your mind instead.","75","1182345"
"12585","Dogma' is Kevin Smith's fourth film and it looks like his first but I'm not ready to quit him -- there's a landmark in him. I just wish the crafty, raucous Dogma was it.","75","120655"
"12586","There must be nine or 10 thwacks to the neck throughout Sleepy Hollow, and Burton finds a different way to make the resulting severed noggin fall as though you'd forgotten the last one.","75","162661"
"12587","Perhaps the most impressive thing that Newell has done with Donnie Brasco is to cull an atypically low-key and introspective performance from Al Pacino, an actor known for manic, scenery-chewing efforts.","75","119008"
"12588","Though it's bogged down by a stiff cast, a yawn-inspiring conventional romance, and a sappy religiosity, it remains a landmark in the history of special effects.","75","46534"
"12589","The transformation sequences on their own are disturbing enough to upset sensitive viewers (even though the first one doesn't occur until an hour into the 97 minute film, making the first two-thirds of the movie relatively tame, with the exception of a few appearances by Jack, who looks like a ""walking meatloaf"").","75","82010"
"12590","[Schumer’s] made this woman real, flawed, funny and carnal.","75","3152624"
"12591","Comes closer to what a Bond movie should be and once was.","75","143145"
"12592","The film's real subject is the unacknowledged intensity of the father-daughter bond and the difficulty of separation, though Shyer, true to his name, shies away from the more painful implications of the material. [20 Dec 1991, p.B]","75","101862"
"12593","Unlike the book, the movie slides into idealistic Hollywood convenience (the state-run labour camps, for example, are paradise compared to the privately owned versions), but the story is driven by gritty realism and remarkable acting. [31 July 2009, p.R20]","75","32551"
"12594","Has a slow build and a strong payoff, but George Clooney is the element that holds it together.","75","465538"
"12595","Uneven though it is, the film is peppered with enough cherishable dialogue tics and dummkopf punchlines to make it a enjoyable watch.","75","491175"
"12596","It crash-lands with an ending of soppy moralizing, but until the end, it's smart and merciless in the tradition of the original story.","75","139134"
"12597","The film bobs along like a designer balloon, pumped with wry observations on Marky Mark and Mentos ads. But none of the other cartoonish characters command like twinkly Silverstone.","75","112697"
"12598","Del Toro, with his melancholy-brute features, endows this raging beast with some of the ''Why me?'' poignance you may remember from Lon Chaney Jr.'s performance in the original.","75","780653"
"12599","While the sluggish beginning and ending mar this Star Trek outing somewhat, there's still enough here to please fans of the series, and, to a lesser extent, movie-goers in general.","75","88170"
"12600","The overly earnest movie falls below the rich ambiguities that Keaton brings to the part, resulting in a measured drama so restrained it sometimes underserves the material. Where ""Birdman"" magnified Keaton's talent, Spotlight leans on it.","75","1895587"
"12601","There's Theron, like a force of nature, compelling us to go beyond TV-movie supposition and look Wuornos straight in the eye. Her raw and riveting performance makes Monster an experience you won't forget.","75","340855"
"12602","Just sit back, plug in, and enjoy the shocks - so adroitly administered, so sweetly sensational. [24 Feb 1995]","75","111149"
"12603","The most provocative aspect of this compulsive riddle is how it resists closure. The end comes not when we have the answer, but when the movie reaches its irresolute end.","75","443706"
"12604","Meg Ryan does this sort of thing about as well as it can possibly be done, and after ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and ""You've Got Mail,"" here is another ingenious plot that teases us with the possibility that true love will fail, while winking that, of course, it will prevail.","75","35423"
"12605","Aggressive editing could have shortened Giant considerably, but the three hour twenty-one minute running time permits the tale to breathe. And, even at this length, there are times when events feel rushed or compressed... So, although Giant may not be a classic in the purest sense of the word, it's a fine example of a virtually-extinct genre.","75","49261"
"12606","Safe House rockets along, taking a familiar formula and making it work - hard.","75","1599348"
"12607","By the time Missing begins its crucial last half-hour, a strange thing has happened. We care about this dead American, and his wife and father, almost despite the movie. The performances of Spacek and Lemmon carry us along through the movie's undisciplined stylistic displays.","75","84335"
"12608","Aniston's work opposite the screen's premiere mild-mannered funnyman shows her at her most engaged and pitch perfect.","75","889573"
"12609","Oliver Stone's film paints a reasonably complex portrait of Morrison's life and times. [01 Mar 1991]","75","101761"
"12610","Christopher Nolan's The Prestige has just about everything I require in a movie about magicians, except ... the Prestige.","75","482571"
"12611","Although Enough Said never really surmounts its TV sitcom style and structure, the director provides a nuanced entertainment that is enjoyable. She is aided beyond measure by the charisma of her two stars — especially Mr. Gandolfini, who reveals a side of himself we’ve never seen before.","75","2390361"
"12612","The spectacle is nothing short of refreshing.","75","266452"
"12613","A nice gift for science fiction fans.","75","66434"
"12614","It's scariest as a parable about the evil that exists in the hearts of adolescent boys.","75","118636"
"12615","Mike Mills’s 20th Century Women incurs sorrow at the prospect of saying goodbye to its characters.","75","4385888"
"12616","If it's not up to the cups-and-balls elegance of previous Mamet movies like ''The Spanish Prisoner'' and ''House of Games,'' if it piles on more psychological fake-outs than is safe in a setup this size -- well, at least it's got that talk, that language, that thing Mamet does that is at this point as identifiable as the cadences of the Bard.","75","252503"
"12617","As the man who made the monster and now has to live with it, Pacino's a blast.","75","258153"
"12618","Beyond Milk, few of the other characters are given much to do.","75","1013753"
"12619","This sci-fi thriller -- which is alternately nail-biting, gorgeous and a little silly -- spends most of its time throwing mechanical and human errors at the most important space mission ever.","75","448134"
"12620","Technically dazzling but emotionally empty. [22 Oct 1993, p.5]","75","107688"
"12621","Blue Ruin joins “Shotgun Stories” and “Joe” as vivid reminders that however homogenized American culture seems, there are still pockets that are distinct, with people who live by their own rules and their own bloody code.","75","2359024"
"12622","Like virtually all fish stories, it's discursive, funny, full of boasting, a suspect mix of truth and lies with an emphasis on the latter.","75","319061"
"12623","Might have been about the rise and fall of a family of gifted children. That would have been the typical way to approach the story. Instead, it's something rare -- a movie about people who have already fallen, whose best days are behind them.","75","265666"
"12624","To its credit, the film isn't foolhardy enough to challenge the unbeatable Errol Flynn version on its own star-power turf. Gritty in most ways, broadly comic in some, and with a dose of the morbidly supernatural, this is a knowing variation at odds with quaint vintage-Hollywood reverence. [14 June 1991, p.1D]","75","102798"
"12625","While Sing Street is often infectious its its scraggly energy, one wishes Conor’s other band members were slightly more fleshed-out, which would make their already-absorbing performances sing even more.","75","3544112"
"12626","If there were an ounce of pretension in this, it would be unbearable. But it is clear that nobody in the film takes it seriously, and that everyone is having fun, and you just can't help having fun with them. [28 June 1991]","75","102510"
"12627","Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are attractive stars, but what's most appealing about the picture is the value it puts on sharing ideas and feelings through language.","75","112471"
"12628","It's crisply and cleanly shot throughout, and the filmmaker shows a rare feel for how to not only make comedy land, but also to make it actually feel cinematic too.","75","3011894"
"12629","Aside from some effective suspense sequences, the film's strengths lie in the relationship between the heroines, which is well developed and plausible by genre standards.","75","112722"
"12630","Is Carrey funny? Of course, because Stiller and the script allow him to be funny, at the expense of tension. [14 June 1996, p.3]","75","115798"
"12631","During its two hours-plus running time, Field's movie veers from dark comedy to melodrama, not always gracefully. But tonal inconsistencies don't blunt the keenness of its satire, so sharp that I walked out with emotional razor burn.","75","404203"
"12632","By casting attractive stars in the leads, by finding the right visual look, by underlining the action with brooding, ominously sad music, a good director can create the illusion of meaning even when nothing's there.","75","107798"
"12633","The Edge of Seventeen isn’t John Hughes for a new generation – it’s much more honest than that.","75","1878870"
"12634","Theron and Davis are dynamite together, the actresses playing off each other like two sides of the same coin.","75","5610554"
"12635","A moody picture that's filled from start to finish with camera tricks, unexpected angles and innovative flourishes.","75","270288"
"12636","It's some scary fun to watch.","75","161081"
"12637","Perry's great gift to this unfilmable play is getting it on the screen, his sharp eye for casting and his evident affection and sympathy for black womanhood, even in movies in which he doesn't don a dress.","75","1405500"
"12638","Visually drab and flabby around the edges. Its seamy tale of murder is not layered in any way; what you see (or, in Wilder’s case, hear) is what you get.","75","36775"
"12639","Paul is a little sloppy and a little sappy, but the filmmakers' passion for their subject matter carries it over the occasional rough spot.","75","1092026"
"12640","About as warm, pleasing and inviting as a film about divorce, infidelity and terminal cancer can be.","75","120686"

"12642","Unlike many action thrillers where the viewer is fairly certain that no real harm can come to the protagonists, such is never the case here. In this gritty ride-along, we sense that anything can happen, which adds to the propulsive momentum of a riveting story.","75","1855199"
"12643","A riot of visual invention and weird humor that works on its chosen sub-moronic level, and on several others as well, including some fairly sophisticated ones.","75","101452"

"12655","Using a style heavily indebted to music videos - lots of fast cutting, odd angles and gratuitous camera movements - Hopkins keeps the energy level up, though his manner is a bit too choppy to keep all of the diverse elements together. [11 Aug 1989, p.B]","75","97981"

"12673","David Ayer's film is a gory, muddy, downbeat tale of war's hellishness and the fraternal bond between those stuck in the middle of it. It's also, like ""Ryan,"" full of tense, grippingly staged action scenes that capture moments of pure adrenaline, and it's the tension between those two impulses that makes ""Fury"" fascinating and ultimately flawed.","75","2713180"

"12675","One of those rare films whose historical impact outweighs its quality. It's a good film, but not a classic. Yet, although little more than a socially conscious, well executed science fiction adventure film, Planet of the Apes arrived in theaters at just the right time to capture the country's imagination.","75","63442"
"12676","The laughs are sardonic, and the reality of Chayefsky's heavy-handed message (i.e., hospitals treat their patients badly) eats away at the viewer. But even when it falls flat, it's still an interesting watch.","75","67217"

"12683","The remake of The Last House on the Left breaks the template, taking the 1972 original into an interesting new direction, with bold camera angles, good actors and a script that heaps on just as much character development as carnage.","75","844708"
"12684","It's entertaining, and following an old Disney tradition Frozen works some old-school magic in its nonhuman characters.","75","2294629"
"12685","A tamer tale of supernatural shenanigans that is far more appropriate for young children than the sometimes too-scary scenes from J.K. Rowling's stories.","75","963966"

"12693","For a lot of its runtime, Velvet is fun and silly and enjoyably outrageous. It’s hard, though, to walk away with a real sense of anything more than blood on the canvas and a blank where your feelings — beyond mild bemusement, and a sudden appetite for prime Los Angeles real estate — should be.","75","7043012"
"12694","Check your brain at the popcorn-butter pump in the lobby and enjoy it.","75","3316948"
"12695","For all its accomplishments, Far from Heaven remains hermetic, an elegant exercise in deadpan irony. What does the movie ultimately mean? Art, we're told, should not mean, but be -- but Haynes's cinematic essays are designed to provoke commentary.","75","297884"

"12697","When you’re not shaking your head at Theron’s glass-crunching gymnastics, you’re probably soaking up Leitch’s emerald-lensed atmospheres, Luhrmann-esque set pieces, and the sensual lighting that could give Nicolas Winding Refn a seizure or two. That’s all without saying a single thing about its fabulous soundtrack.","75","2406566"

"12700","The Adventures of the Ford Fairlane is an exceptionally well-made film that is everything you could ever want in an Andrew Dice Clay movie; it's vulgar, tasteless, nasty, cynical, and, at times, very funny.","75","98987"
"12701","At its best, The Mist just wants to make you jump.","75","884328"
"12702","There's even a shootout sequence that plays out, from start to finish, while our hero is in flagrante. That's something I don't believe I've ever seen in a movie.","75","1502404"
"12703","That the movie works so well is also due to the exceptional talents of leads Simonischek and Hüller, who hold nothing back — especially the former, whose Winfried is one of the oddest ducks in recent movies.","75","4048272"
"12704","Placing style above coherence, Seven glosses over plot points and shows a weakness for cheap, lurid effects.","75","114369"
"12705","Hanna's a memorable creation, a girl who carries danger with her like a plague.","75","993842"
"12706","The main problem with Breach is that the story is told through O'Neill, who's far less compelling, in part because Phillippe doesn't have the chops to draw out his own set of contradictions. By committing himself to O'Neill's perspective, Ray misses the opportunity to uncover more information about Hanssen's relationship with his wife and church, his aberrant sexuality, and his mysterious connection to the Russians.","75","401997"
"12707","As distinctively Wellesian as Citizen Kane, and packing nearly as many technical wonders.","75","38991"
"12708","Cool stuff. Cool movie.","75","486822"
"12709","A beguiling little film that, with deceptive restraint and forthrightness, opens up worlds of roiling, contradictory emotions.","75","1174732"
"12710","Jon M. Chu’s film certainly delivers on the lavish trappings of the former interpretation, but if the latter is meant to be the mood of the film, it falls a little short. I wanted things to be a little crazier, I guess, wild high-society intrigue staged with the satisfying bite of mean, wicked satire.","75","3104988"
"12711","While Crawl never quite achieves the classic status of Jaws, it’s so convincing that you forget about the mechanics and become petrified by the gore.","75","8364368"
"12712","It's equal parts shivery and silly -- eyeball popping in slo-mo!","75","805570"
"12713","See it and prepare to be stunned and exhausted at the same time.","75","5311542"
"12714","Major League is a movie that knows what it's up to. It skims along agreeable surfaces, expertly balancing its comedy with melodrama and fulfilling expectations right on schedule. As a movie, it`s a superior industrial product.","75","97815"
"12715","Jonze's satiric, brave-new-world premise is undeniably clever, but it's also a bit icy emotionally.","75","1798709"
"12716","At once funny and poignant — and not just for moviegoers of a certain age.","75","3236120"
"12717","The picture is neither flawless nor foolproof, but it's smart and tight enough to keep audiences off-balance and entertained for the running length.","75","289992"
"12718","A refreshing if obvious drama. [9 June 1989, Friday, p.A]","75","97165"
"12719","Lily Tomlin works miracles. She's comedy royalty whose best films (Nashville, The Late Show, All of Me, I Heart Huckabees) always cut deeper than a smile. But no Oscar. Maybe Grandma will do the trick. It's a Tomlin tour de force.","75","4270516"
"12720","Pitt is undoubtedly luminous as the brightest star of Ad Astra, an engaging and even hopeful exploration about the consistency of human feelings, no matter where you are in the galaxy.","75","2935510"
"12721","One of the most genuinely haunting ghost stories in recent years, The Changeling is much eerier and more effective than the overrated and bombastic Poltergeist.","75","80516"
"12722","The cameos are out-of-sight, though the gay jokes and sexual innuendoes are overdone. But even if you don't know Peter from Bobby, you'll still be apt to find the Brady brand of geeky optimism thoroughly infectious. [17 Feb 1995, p.1D]","75","112572"
"12723","Stiller and Sandler strike a warm and believably awkward brotherly connection, hitting some real on screen highs as they sit around the piano with Marvel singing Sandler’s catchy tunes.","75","5536736"
"12724","For the most part, it's imaginatively staged and consistently entertaining.","75","268695"
"12725","May not be an absolute triumph, but it's significantly better than just a good effort.","75","119223"
"12726","Nicholson makes the movie so poignant that it's hard to resist, but I wonder if Payne and Taylor are rejecting the skeptical attitudes of their other films to become more popular, hoping a softer emotional tone will help this picture win the Oscars that have eluded their more tough-minded works.","75","257360"
"12727","Arrives as the perfect midsummer movie, a comedy about a flawed-but-functional family that, like ""Toy Story 3,"" captures the drama of growth and separation in all its exhilaration and heartache.","75","842926"
"12728","Room has unforgettable, must-witness performances, and its soulful mother and son narrative is one of the most touching dynamics you’ll see in theaters this year.","75","3170832"
"12729","A suitably inspiring biopic despite its narrative unevenness and occasional reliance on schmaltz, seeks to show audiences the origin story of a cultural icon.","75","4669788"

"12731","Evil Under The Sun is not, alas, as good as Beat the Devil, but it is the best of the recent group of Christie retreads.","75","83908"
"12732","It’s a touching scenario, and one so well-acted and laced with superb special effects that even its more obvious beats cut deep.","75","3416532"
"12733","Dense with plot intricacies, thick with atmosphere, and packed with showy roles for a hip ensemble.","75","114814"
"12734","A piercing dignity defines this infamous Tod Browning picture, in which a community of circus sideshow performers exact revenge on the trapeze beauty who exploits one of their own.","75","22913"
"12735","An intense story about an all-powerful Chinese crime lord and his extended family. [26 Jan 1996]","75","115012"

"12737","There are flaws, but also some fun surprises. Much closer to Hitchcock than ""Hostel,"" this is what can happen when a pile of trash falls into the hands of a talented and resourceful director (James DeMonaco).","75","2184339"
"12738","Kudos go to the great Thomas Newman, whose score contributes as much as either lead to what is finally a two-character movie, though one well-performed by all. [23 Sept 1994]","75","111161"
"12739","Achieves the odd distinction of being the first post-9/11 NYPD corruption movie - complete with a shootout in the Criminal Courts building. Cool.","75","450232"
"12740","Swedish director Björn Runge’s approach is no-nonsense and workmanlike, perhaps to give these esteemed actors room to swagger and shine, but a bit more imagination and artistry wouldn’t have hurt.","75","3750872"
"12741","Pick your cliche - searing, rivetting, haunting - Keitel delivers a performance to rival Brando's in ""Last Tango In Paris.""","75","103759"
"12742","If Batman did nothing else but restore pulp-art shadow to the icon sanitized in his pop-art TV reincarnation, it would be an achievement. Tim Burton's Batman, starring a subdued Michael Keaton as you-know-who and a supercharged Jack Nicholson as the Joker, handily accomplishes that mission.","75","96895"
"12743","An entertaining thriller that stumbles occasionally on overlong dialogue sequences.","75","79240"
"12744","Fortunately, this film doesn't have to depend on off-screen dalliances to prove its worth.","75","228750"
"12745","A successful work of art. To see this movie is to feel that you've lived it.","75","1278379"
"12746","Schepisi, with his camera always moving, has the knack of keeping the viewer as slightly off balance as Guare's story does, and the result is a fascinating motion picture. [21 Jan 1994, p.3F]","75","108149"
"12747","The Perks of Being a Wallflower tweaks the formula just enough to remain fresh and offer something a little new. It's sad, funny, warm, and nostalgic - kind of like high school, really.","75","1659337"
"12748","Bay has two great assets in Connery and Cage. The special effects give The Rock a James Bondian feel so Connery's wry, world-weary devil-may-careishness looks right at home here.","75","117500"
"12749","A Southern-style ""Ocean's 11"" without the pretty boys and Vegas attitude but with plenty of laughs.","75","335245"
"12750","The [final] battle is vast, and undoubtedly required thousands of hours of matching puppetry, robotics and computer code, but it is not without tedium.","75","167260"
"12751","The movie is a star vehicle at heart, aimed more at marketing Pitt's popularity than probing complexities of empire-building and cultural clash that trouble the Tibetan region to this day.","75","120102"
"12752","It's warm, entertaining, funny, and centered around that great Sissy Spacek performance, but it's essentially pretty familiar material (not that Loretta Lynn can be blamed that Horatio Alger wrote her life before she lived it). The movie isn't great art, but it has been made with great taste and style; it's more intelligent and observant than movie biographies of singing stars used to be. That makes it a treasure to watch, even if we sometimes have the feeling we've seen it before.","75","80549"
"12753","In the compelling but slow-moving Iranian film A Separation, a downbeat family drama of no particular distinction gradually turns into a mystery that raises painful moral questions. There may be several guilty parties.","75","1832382"
"12754","Blessedly unimportant, Fantastic Four cruises along on modest yet genuine comic-book pleasures.","75","120667"
"12755","It’s all good, goofy fun; make it an air-conditioned double feature with “Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again” and you might just have the very definition of “summer movies.”","75","4779682"
"12756","This is another brilliant performance by Crowe, who is to body language what Meryl Streep is to accents.","75","268978"
"12757","Portman’s delicate and damaged portrayal is mesmerizing.","75","4682804"
"12758","The picture is more impressive as it goes along, revealing a symmetry of construction underneath the rudiments of a thriller.","75","179626"
"12759","The Scottish director’s short, blunt thriller is so violently nerve-jangling that it feels like a stretch to recommend it, exactly.","75","5742374"
"12760","Hard Times feels most like a brilliant prerequisite to the cinema of Michael Mann, a focused neo-western where the last man standing is the one truest to himself.","75","73092"

"12762","Even when its emotions run a bit out of control, Kramer vs. Kramer is a strong and positive film. Its performances are first-rate, from Hoffman and streep down to Howard Duff (as a divorce lawyer) and a terrifically talented lad named Justin Henry, who visibly matures in his portrayal of Billy, the contested kid.","75","79417"
"12763","What Hill hasn’t yet mastered, despite considerable skill as a first-time filmmaker, is how to impose a narrative more quietly, especially in finding the right ending. He also doesn’t seem to fully trust his sense of humor.","75","5613484"
"12764","Here is a strong and simple story surrounded by needless complications, and flawed by a last act that first disappoints us and then ends on a note of forced whimsy.","75","162222"
"12765","The result is a thrill ride with enough plunges and turns and loop-the-loops to make it worth a spin. What the picture lacks is the magic and resonance you feel in the best of popular entertainments.","75","113497"
"12766","The visual and emotional hues are darker [than previous Pixar films], and the focus rests more on middle age than coming of age. The adventures of a family of superheroes are likely to thrill and amuse children, but the film's more grown-up themes might go over their heads.","75","317705"
"12767","A smart, spectacular and rousing piece of work, one that strains against but can't quite escape the natural limitations imposed by a sequel. [4 July 1990, p.C1]","75","99423"
"12768","Sex Drive has shaky moments, and its smutty gags aren't edited so much as slammed together.","75","1135985"
"12769","With its fades to blinding white and its atmosphere of testosterone-fueled paranoia, Carpenter's remake hews more closely to the source material — John W. Campbell, Jr.'s 1938 novella ""Who Goes There?"" — than THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD and is a masterful exercise in claustrophobic suspense.","75","84787"
"12770","The movie's intentions are as serious and thoughtful as its content is timely and sometimes horrifying. For adventurous viewers only.","75","147612"
"12771","If Elysium is the brainiest Hollywood movie of the summer, it's also the most conflicted one.","75","1535108"
"12772","Midnight movie programmers of the future will undoubtedly give it a long life years after it’s gone from first-run theaters.","75","2101441"
"12773","There are a couple of scenes of pure, sentimental genius, as well as appealingly boggled turns by Rudd and Wilson.","75","1341188"
"12774","Spaceballs has the happy air of a comic enterprise that knows it's going right. It just keeps spritzing the gags at us, Borscht Belt-style, confidently and rightly sensing that if we don't laugh at this one, we'll laugh at the next. And so we do. After a long dry spell, Brooks is back on the money with Spaceballs. [24 Jun 1987, p.33]","75","94012"

But it's smart and unconventional, with a good eye for the perfect detail.","75","333766"
"12776","The direction is dynamic, the cutting has verve. To confess, Rambo: First Blood Part II is unexpectedly taut and exciting, despite its sermonizing and predictable conclusion, assuming Stallone is accepted as that impossible creation, the one-man army. [23 May 1985]","75","89880"
"12777","A tricky-bordering-on-gimmicky film noir with a glaze of soft-core kink.","75","120890"
"12778","Mostly, Warrior is a showcase for its up-and-coming stars. Edgerton, from last year's ""Animal Kingdom,"" and Hardy, who stole scenes as the identity forger in ""Inception.""","75","1291584"
"12779","For sure, it’s another example of style over substance — a richly deserved accusation that is always leveled at this kindergarten cop of a director, but I confess it’s a lot of scattered and disjointed fun.","75","2278388"
"12780","The film has an easy target in poking fun at rural folks, but it also has a warm message about individuality. It's also beautifully photographed. [8 May 1987]","75","93822"
"12781","Like Lurie's previous two films, it's also simplistic and somewhat muddled.","75","272020"

"12785","Deeply nuts and exhaustingly hilarious.","75","425112"
"12786","As in his previous film, Davis gets mileage out of supporting players who do not look or sound like professional actors and so add a level of realism to the action.","75","94602"
"12787","Palmer and Bello really do seem like world-weary, spook-addled daughter and mother, and they play the stakes just so, favoring neither blase understatement nor yellow-highlighter melodrama. They're strong enough to take your mind off some lapses in narrative judgment.","75","4786282"
"12788","As written, Jasmine is a hopeless neurotic, trapped in a perpetual panic. As played, she has a wicked hint of Scarlett O'Hara.","75","2334873"

"12791","The kind of movie that can get you simultaneously laughing and shaking your head at its audacity.","75","158983"
"12792","The movie is more successful as a thriller than as a thoughtful examination of war and its horrors; Mendes seems less interested in bigger ideas about the nightmare of battle and its effects on his characters than he is in Hitchcockian audience manipulation.","75","8579674"
"12793","A surprisingly effective little horror nightmare.","75","963794"
"12794","With everything this film has going for it - humor, intelligence and a splendid ensemble - Richard Linklater's nightmare drug movie, A Scanner Darkly, should be continually compelling. But it loses its fizz after a strong series of pops.","75","405296"
"12795","One thing Mississippi Grind has in spades is soul, and that's a better bet than narrative mechanics any day.","75","2349144"
"12796","An honest and breezily melancholic film, thoroughly clear-sighted in its intentions and ideas and bravely committed to the emotional rigors of its central relationship.","75","1405365"
"12797","Writer-director Jaco Van Dormael (“Toto the Hero”) spins flashbacks and time-lapse photography, stunning montages, whirling, circling cameras and stunning underwater, deep space and Martian landscape photography into a film that is as intentionally opaque as it is overlong.","75","485947"
"12798","Never becomes the thoroughly satisfying psychological drama that it promises to be. There's also a problem with the central metaphor of ice -- a literary device that turns repetitive and obvious.","75","119349"
"12799","It’s a movie that both understands the basic desire to strike it rich and our deep understanding that one person’s wealth often comes at the expense of another person’s well-being. This isn’t a perfect movie, but it’s admirable for its ability to keep more than one thought in its head at a time.","75","1800302"
"12800","Colorful Cajun noir, spicy, romantic, efficient.","75","92654"
"12801","No matter what you think of dumb comedies, The Interview, thanks allegedly to Kim, has gone from disposable to indispensible cinema. It’s a must-see movie in the context of what has happened, and will spark a discussion of, in comedy, how far is too far?","75","2788710"
"12802","A smashing success on its own terms, though as a transcendent love story it lacks the firm foundation in human reality that characterizes Lars Von Trier's superior ""Breaking the Waves.""","75","116209"
"12803","Alan Parker has directed the film as if he were a sniper: you never know when you're going to get hit next, but from the first moments you know you're being aimed at. The opening, with Hayes taping hash to his chest only to be apprehended at the airport, must have looked like standard stuff in Oliver Stone's script, but on screen it's unadulterated adrenalin, filmed with fast cuts timed in counterpoint to the sound of Hayes' pounding heart. [25 Oct 1978]","75","77928"
"12804","It's rooting against grandma that drives this violent, hardhearted film, and waiting for the pride of lions she's created to devour her that gives Animal Kingdom its animal energy.","75","1313092"
"12805","An engagingly knuckleheaded comic vehicle for former Saturday Night Live trouper Will Ferrell.","75","357413"
"12806","Corbet’s work is a big, sloppy wet kiss to all manner of rise-and-fall clichés. Yet it mostly works, with Corbet as eager to display his influences...as he is to prove he can handle his own gonzo-spectacle set-pieces.","75","5960374"
"12807","This is a tour-de-force performance, delivered by an actor at the top of his game, and it's a shame that K-Pax, instead of engaging our imaginations as it promises to, devolves into such a conventional, paint-by- numbers disappointment.","75","272152"
"12808","I won't be able to talk anybody into or out of the Pirates of the Caribbean experience now, so I'll simply offer sage advice: Hit the bathroom just before it starts. To miss any five-minute chunk of this densely plotted trilogy-capper will leave you confused.","75","449088"
"12809","The special effects are scream-worthy, the gore is minimal and the humor has a folksy zing to it. [19 Jan 1990, p.1D]","75","100814"
"12810","Simon Curtis’ Woman in Gold is a shamelessly sentimental fictionalization of this true story, but it’s a fascinating story nonetheless, beautifully photographed and greatly elevated by a brilliant performance from the invaluable Helen Mirren.","75","2404425"
"12811","While the original movie benefited from narrative simplicity and an admirable lack of villains, this one paints the screen with too many characters and frequent diversions from the main story, but nevertheless serves up a bountiful and sugary feast for the 3-D-bespectacled eyes.","75","1646971"
"12812","A Simple Favor is a thriller that ticks likes a Timex, a precision exercise in button-pushing manipulation and a laugh out loud mystery that mocks its own manipulations, giggles at its own far-fetched twists.","75","7040874"

"12818","True to its word, Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark delivers an entrancing thriller that explores the power of narratives with a few screams to boot.","75","3387520"
"12819","Last Flag Flying is colored by how time reshapes our sense of self, embracing some memories while occluding others, and the film ingeniously folds the viewer into a similar state of reflection and uncertainty about previous eras of false optimism about national values.","75","6018306"

"12822","Angela Bassett is great as his strict, single mother; The soundtrack is great, of course, and the ending features moving archival footage of the streets of Brooklyn after Wallace's murder.","75","472198"
"12823","Eastwood keeps the tension humming from his director's chair and contributes a little too much comic relief, but gives Costner an eye-opening, image-shattering showcase that adds a sheen to his often-criticized acting career. [24 Nov 1993, p.6B]","75","107808"
"12824","It becomes a bleak comic spit into the face of organized religion, organized society, and even organized narrative.","75","93593"

"12828","The leads, who were born six weeks apart in 1937, have remarkable hare-and-tortoise chemistry.","75","825232"
"12829","Bullock, easing into her mid-40s with box-office mojo intact, remains the star attraction as the annoyingly endearing Mary. You simply can't imagine another actor of her stature pulling it off.","75","881891"
"12830","Subtle, neurotic and multi-layered, every scene in The Stunt Man is about multiple things at once. Paranoia, obviously, but also the stress of filmmaking and simply living.","75","81568"
"12831","During a summer with the usual transforming robots and young wizards, this chilly flick is a bit of a break, and there are worse options than letting this Orphan in the door.","75","1148204"
"12832","Rent isn't nearly as transporting a film as the Oscar-winning adaptation of ""Chicago,"" but its energies and passions compensate for a lot of its deficiencies.","75","294870"
"12833","That the would-be buddies are played by Harrison Ford and Brad Pitt ensures enough star power to keep things moving even during the sluggish early scenes that set up their relationship.","75","118972"
"12834","Sandlot is no ''Stand By Me'' -- it lacks the dramatic, us-vs.- them power of that popular '80s film. The look is simple, direct, often gimmicky with the big dog purposely overdone as a clunky animatronic figure. The movie is also a little long. But somehow its contrived tone and style become minor charms. You walk away feeling that perhaps people aren't as mean as the movies make them out to be these days and that maybe there's hope after all. Or at least there was in 1962. [7 Apr 1993, p.C1]","75","108037"
"12835","An unlovable movie. It's morally ambiguous, which means there's no real rooting interest. It's episodic, with the same kinds of episodes repeated over and over, so there's little sense of forward motion. It feels philosophically and politically confused, so there's no message to take from it.","75","408306"
"12836","The screenplay may have too many holes in it, but it gets a merit badge for the cleverness of its sarcastic dialogue, much of which is unprintable here. [13 Dec 1991, p.20]","75","102266"
"12837","My Cousin Vinny would have been a moderately funny movie in any case. But with Joe Pesci in the leading role, the movie escalates several notches to a rough-and-tumble, exciting comedy and proves that Pesci is one of the most versatile actors in the business. [19 Mar 1992, p.6E]","75","104952"
"12838","With his breathy, antic delivery, pouring out his heart in staccato bursts, Cusack puts a nice loop on the sensitive teen theme. For his is an upbeat, mature brand of sensitivity, the healthy kind that makes fine discriminations, not nasty judgments.","75","98258"
"12839","Throughout, the subtle glimpses of a couple’s lingering affection for one another complicate the bitterness of their separation.","75","7653254"
"12840","Rob Marshall's flawed but frequently dazzling Nine is a hot-blooded musical fantasia full of song, dance, raging emotion and simmering sexuality.","75","875034"
"12841","Cobb is an ironic and telling look at the machinery of myth-making and the chasm that can exist between image and reality. It is enriched by going further - into the impact on the relationship of two very different men. [13 Jan 1995, p.05]","75","109450"
"12842","An ecstatic sensory experience so overloaded it hardly matters that the narrative has been placed on a back burner.","75","163988"
"12843","A gripping, tautly-paced action flick that outdoes most of Hollywood's similar output. This is clear evidence that film quality often has little to do with a production's budget.","75","104815"
"12844","Black Rain is a brilliant visual tour de force wrapped around a fair suspense plot. The result is a movie that is so exciting to look at that you tend to forget that the story is rather hackneyed, except for the setting. [26 Sep 1989, p.3D]","75","96933"
"12845","It is not about whether the hero will get the girl. It is about whether the hero should get the girl, and when was the last time you saw a movie that even knew that could be the question?","75","94006"
"12846","The humor gets raunchy enough to earn the ""R"" rating, but in some ways, it's pretty tame, especially in the wake of ""The Hangover.""","75","815236"
"12847","Exceedingly well cast and assembled with flashy visuals and pacing by Harron, this period piece is diminished by its relative pointlessness.","75","144084"
"12848","A two hour aquatic pursuit pic with bruising stunts, fun-to-watch performances, a dozen good chortles and imposing Panavision renderings of post-apocalyptic crud, Waterworld clearly has the makings of a cult movie.","75","114898"
"12849","No doubt about it: Top Gun is going to be the hit that ""The Right Stuff"" should have been. They are not in the same class of films, but this much must be said: The aerial sequences in Top Gun are as thrilling -- while remaining coherent -- as any ever put on film.","75","92099"
"12850","Pet Sematary balances humor, drama, and horror believably while exploring the inner turmoil of a seemingly ordinary couple; though the script does not go far enough in establishing their new life and dodgy special effects hurt some scenes. Happily, the cast makes up for these flaws with great turns, lead by Jeté Laurence, whose performance is reason enough to watch the film.","75","837563"
"12851","Benton's version of The Human Stain feels under-energized and modest to a fault. Yet it still delivers a genuine sad sting.","75","308383"
"12852","If it all sometimes feels trapped in the amber of his intentions, Brooklyn still casts a quiet sort of spell: a meticulously, lovingly made mood piece, full of empathy for the ones who can’t speak — at least not always the way they want to — for themselves.","75","385887"
"12853","What makes The Anniversary Party intriguing is how close it cuts to the bone of reality--how we're teased to draw parallels between some of the characters and the actors who play them.","75","254099"
"12854","The devilishly clever script tries a lot of things. Not all of them work, but it's hard not to admire Whedon and Goddard for the attempts. This is definitely not your standard kids-get-slaughtered-by-zombies motion picture.","75","1259521"
"12855","The Conjuring, at points, is terrifying. Wan really understands how active, acrobatic camerawork can enhance the storytelling without breaking the fourth wall, a technique abused by today’s horror craftsmen.","75","1457767"
"12856","Ross's comedy isn't as inventive as ""The Truman Show,"" which it resembles in some ways, but it explores interesting ideas with nimble humor.","75","120789"
"12857","Even lacking the laughs and romance, he (Emmerich) has delivered an entertaining eye-roller of alternative history.","75","1521197"
"12858","It's a fantastic special effect because it doesn't look like a special effect: The movie sells the illusion that the suit could maybe, possibly, exist.","75","371746"
"12859","What’s fun is just watching Lopez and her supporting cast — including her real-life best friend Remini, Tony winner Annaleigh Ashford as her tightly wound coworker, and a loopy Charlyne Yi as her phobic new assistant — move through the scenes so easily.","75","2126357"
"12860","It's a soaring, crashing, blazing affair with pyrotechnic performances by real-life spouses Marc Anthony and Jennifer Lopez as Lavoe and his wife, Puchi. Like a plane disaster, it holds you in thrall of ¡ay, Dios mio! drama.","75","458522"
"12861","Prometheus is the antithesis of the ""big, dumb summer movie."" Its visuals and special effects can stand toe-to-toe with any of the season's spectacles, but are audiences ready for something with an intelligent, thought-provoking screenplay where the action is secondary? Prometheus is flawed, but stupidity cannot be numbered among its missteps.","75","1446714"
"12862","Everything in Ready Player One ties together into an action-packed, upbeat, hero’s journey that keeps the film moving along at a thrilling pace. While it’s not particularly emotional and I was disappointed by how many questions are left open by its shallow visits to the real world, it’s still a lot of fun.","75","1677720"
"12863","For Friday night this will do just fine. It's definitely a good matchup -- Stone's cynical bravado versus Berry's resilient spunkiness in a world-class cat fight.","75","327554"
"12864","The film is still a gripping experience, though, with its circling sharks, its sun-dappled beauty and its agonies of shattered hope. At one point I was convinced that Sandra Bullock would splash down next to our man in her space capsule and Hanks’ Maersk ship from “Captain Phillips” would steam by to pick up both of them.","75","2017038"
"12865","Tilda Swinton is the star of We Need to Talk About Kevin, and her performance is so complex and volcanic and transfixing that all of the film's flaws melt away.","75","1242460"
"12866","If its aim to inspire and educate inevitably leaves the movie feeling a little classroom-bound, Harriet is still an impassioned, edifying portrait of a remarkable life, and a fitting showcase for the considerable talents of its star, Tony-winning British actress Cynthia Erivo.","75","4648786"
"12867","As the style begins to wear out its welcome, the promise of a resolution and nifty twist keep things nimble. Like a well-crafted paperback, Search never commits the cardinal sin of being boring.","75","7668870"
"12868","The low-key approach probably gets closer to the soul of Leonard, but it lacks zip. As a result, Out of Sight sometimes runs out of gas.","75","120780"
"12869","It would really help to get into the right frame of mind before seeing The Time Traveler's Wife, because viewed from some angles - maybe most angles - the movie is ridiculous.","75","452694"
"12870","If nothing else, The Omega Man remains worth seeing for its remarkable shots of Heston wandering through an abandoned metropolis.","75","67525"
"12871","Even when informed by Douglas' characteristic intensity, Spartacus has no real identity apart from ""the common man""; at his side, the beautiful Jean Simmons is never anything more than Spartacus' chick - the proof that he's a manly man, as opposed to those mincing Roman aristocrats. Whatever Trumbo's progressive leanings, he was not past equating homosexuality with unspeakable evil and perversion.","75","54331"
"12872","Gets back the mood, the pleasure and even some of the freshness of its first installment.","75","413267"
"12873","The careful, strategic navigation of silence and noise is the film’s greatest asset, and when it explores this tension, and the way in which it impacts both the characters and monsters, the result is vibrant, urgent, and innovative.","75","6644200"
"12874","Still, that doesn’t detract too much from what Philomena manages to accomplish: a sober consideration of how ideals relate to institutions — whether they’re religions or political parties — anchored by two well-rounded, funny lead performances.","75","2431286"
"12875","Not only does Invictus tell a remarkable story of a remarkable man, but it also illustrates how sports can be a salve to a wounded community. And that's something New Orleanians can certainly appreciate.","75","1057500"
"12876","Not all of it works - and not all of it works the way the target audience of jacked-up young males might want it to - but the movie is hugely provocative fun, and I'm pretty sure that's on purpose.","75","442933"
"12877","Everett’s utterly fantastic performance as Wilde slightly exceeds his grasp as a first-time filmmaker.","75","2404639"
"12878","In trash as in art there is no accounting for taste, and reader, I cherished this movie in all of its lurid glory.","75","348836"
"12879","Vast, beautiful and meticulously detailed.","75","499549"
"12880","De Palma makes us sweat; slow, quiet scenes are as nerve-bending as occasional explosions and the final, frantic battle. He calls himself a director for hire on projects such as this and ""The Untouchables,"" where he has little input before shooting. But his skill at maintaining tension is his main asset, and he uses it to the max here. [24 May 1996, p.1E]","75","117060"
"12881","Kick-Ass is some kind of twisted fun.","75","1250777"
"12882","The slightly overdone feeling of the photography, the archly evocative acting and Cliff Martinez's music also impart a sly sense of the absurd. Kafka recalls the old joke that reminds us that even paranoids have enemies. [12 Feb. 1992, p.C07]","75","102181"
"12883","Damon, starring in his first full-fledged action pic, brings a determined bearing and believability to the proceedings.","75","258463"
"12884","Suspiria is as striking and severe as the director’s “Call Me by Your Name,” the best film of 2017, was warm and welcoming.","75","1034415"
"12885","With tightly controlled performances and uniquely eccentric events, The Beaver is mainly undone by the lack of a satisfying outcome.","75","1321860"
"12886","King Kong makes clear that Jackson has no contemporary peer when it comes to outsized, transporting fantasies that enchant in an era when special effects have become white noise.","75","360717"
"12887","This is a ride, a video game, a soundtrack -- unapologetic and clearly labeled as such. It has no middle speed.","75","306685"
"12888","So good in so many of its parts that there's a temptation to forgive it when it goes wrong. But it does go wrong, insisting on making larger points than its story really should carry, so that at the end, the human qualities of the characters get lost in the significance of it all. And yet there are those moments of brilliance.","75","73486"
"12889","The film is filled with scenes about scrappy, cut-and-paste filmmaking, and the movie-within-a-movie that drives the plot also ends up as the centerpiece of the hugely affecting final scenes.","75","845046"
"12890","Intelligent, scary (scorpions! lots of scorpions!) and full of the possibilities of scientific fact taken to far-reaching (but credible) extremes, The Arrival delivers more bang for the buck than its high-profile multiplex-mates. [31 May 1996, p.3]","75","115571"
"12891","This is a decidedly blue-state take on a red-state phenomenon.","75","415306"
"12892","With his trademark spare, unfussy direction and jumping into the story approach, Eastwood subtly establishes the themes of faith, loss and love and then he raises the drama to a different level.","75","405159"
"12893","Want your skin to crawl? This one's for you.","75","310357"
"12894","The Avengers is neither overwhelming nor underwhelming. What it expertly is, is whelming.","75","848228"
"12895","Directed by Marielle Heller, Can You Ever Forgive Me? has its funny moments—Richard E. Grant proves to be a sublime comic partner as Jack Hock, a fellow alcoholic who gets roped into Lee’s scheme—but mostly the movie is immensely sad, the story of a woman who deep down desires companionship but just isn’t wired to accept it.","75","4595882"
"12896","Hills is a far cry from its cheesy and predictable predecessor. ""Gruesome"" doesn't begin to describe the horrors that are revealed on-screen here.","75","454841"
"12897","Barton Fink has an atmosphere of languid comic anxiety (it's like a cross between ""Eraserhead"" and ""Angel Heart""), and it's fun to watch, if only because you have no idea what's coming next.","75","101410"
"12898","Loaded with fine performances, traffics in audacious images and generally comports itself with a great deal more grace and gravitas than most movies with roots in fantastic themes.","75","120903"
"12899","A true amalgam of creative forces individually pooling their studio-contract talents like a hive of bees.","75","32138"
"12900","The film smuggles some surprisingly bleak existential questioning inside a brightly comedic vehicle.","75","9484998"
"12901","Death at a Funeral does what a good comedy is supposed to do: generate laughter. The humor gradient is lopsided - the second half, which builds comedic momentum, is significantly funnier than the first half, which is mostly set-up. Still, any such unevenness aside, the overall impression is one of enjoyability.","75","1321509"
"12902","Ferrell is effortlessly uproarious. And watching hardass Wahlberg, in his first starring shot at farce, shake his sillies out is not to be missed.","75","1386588"
"12903","As rigorous and stimulating as its thematic inquiries are, A Dangerous Method ultimately rests as much on its performances, and in that regard, it succeeds far more than it fails.","75","1571222"
"12904","The Coen brothers have never really accepted the idea that a movie has to have a plot. Offbeat characters, sure. Oblique dialogue that sounds meaningful and occasionally is so, absolutely. Eye-catching cinematography and a subtle, mood-reinforcing soundtrack, no question. Irony layered on thickly as cheese in good lasagna, yes. But a narrative that makes sense from end to end? Well, one doesn't have room for everything.","75","477348"
"12905","For movie fans who despair of the state of American cinema, the in-jokes are hilarious.","75","173716"
"12906","One of those movies you like more at the time than in retrospect.","75","1197624"
"12907","Fast-paced and witty, this is Chase's best solo venture to date, and will hold almost anyone's attention for its well-edited 98 minutes. Chase underplays his wackier moments to great effect, though he isn't always quite as funny as he thinks he is. (He also isn't the next Cary Grant, which he seems to believe as well.)","75","89155"
"12908","Loses something when it depends on its computer-generated creatures to carry the story. The effects are a mile above the previous Hulk film, but there's still a certain awkwardness to some movements, and an odd lack of definition to the massive muscles that makes them seem like gelatinous sacks of meat.","75","800080"
"12909","This is a movie about draining, tenderizing and chopping up the audience emotionally.","75","364569"
"12910","Although he’s made his most narratively entertaining movie in years, the filmmaker often still privileges polemical discourse over drama, grinding things to a halt for minutes-long speeches—he’s not so different from Godard in that way—and sometimes getting rather on-the-nose with the already exceptionally apparent contemporary echoes.","75","7349662"
"12911","Jane Austen's deeply ironic novel loses some of its bite but little of its beauty in Emma Thompson's screen adaptation, which is fetchingly photographed and capably acted by Kate Winslet and Hugh Grant, among others.","75","114388"
"12912","Whannell strikes out on his own with his first truly original concept as a writer-director...in a film whose production is as ambitious as its story is formulaic. Thankfully, the former mostly compensates for the latter, making Upgrade a genre-bending summer treat for those who don’t mind a little (okay, a lot) of blood with their popcorn.","75","6499752"
"12913","The Hunger Games is more notable for the holes it doesn't fall into than the great heights it reaches.","75","1392170"
"12914","Amadeus needs an additional 20 minutes running time like ""The Magic Flute"" needs a drum solo. Though the production is gussied up with more frills and decoration than a Viennese dessert trolley, Forman is generally workmanlike in his visual style and very uneven with his handling of actors.","75","86879"
"12915","A slickly made, shoot-'em-up sci-fi fantasia, it stands for the proposition that, inside the most staid local theater, there is a drive-in yearning to be free. [29 Oct 1984, p.B4]","75","88247"
"12916","Though the plot has a few too many holes in it, the sheer fun of RockNRolla makes it easy to overlook such quibbles. Butler will make you forget all about ""Sparta.""","75","1032755"
"12917","A wickedly funny, Naked Gun-style parody that conflates old-style private-eye pics with Shaft and, yes, Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer.","75","317640"
"12918","The film isn't as concerned with terrifying you as it is with showing you a good time, culminating with an over-the-top climax that is simultaneously utterly ridiculous and enjoyable.","75","1262416"
"12919","Much of this movie seems like a retread of Jurassic Park (with a little King Kong thrown in at the end), not because director Steven Spielberg is intentionally copying himself, but because there's really not much more that he can do with the premise.","75","119567"
"12920","So what we have is a movie that will make at least two important groups happy. New Orleans boosters can cheer Green Lantern for its local roots and for the possibility that the inevitable future installments could return to town. And the purists can cheer, knowing that Campbell and crew have done Green Lantern justice.","75","1133985"
"12921","This isn't one of Burton's best, but it has zealous energy. It might have been too macabre for kids in past, but kids these days, they've seen it all, and the charm of a boy and his dog retains its appeal.","75","1142977"
"12922","More often than not laugh-out-loud hilarious.","75","478311"
"12923","A solid, satisfying movie.","75","978759"
"12924","A handsome film, an earnest film, a film with taste in music and photography and a real sense of intelligence. But too often it feels like an exercise. And even when you're impressed by it, you know you're being played.","75","783233"
"12925","Presented the usual way, the film would be enchanting. In 3-D, however, Coraline is completely engrossing. Selick uses the technique brilliantly to enhance the comedy and horror that mingle in his more ""family-friendly"" version of Gaiman's dark story.","75","327597"
"12926","In the Mouth of Madness may leave your spine a little short on tingle (any amount of irony always dissipates the scares), but it compensates by neither insulting your grey matter nor sparing your funny bone. In a genre more brain-dead than not, that's an awfully attractive trade-off. [03 Feb 1995]","75","113409"
"12927","Earthlings beware: The dialogue and characters have less weight than bodies freed from gravity's grip.","75","183523"
"12928","It may not include every nuance of the graphic novel, but it captures as much as any adaptation could -- which may not satisfy the fanboys, but it's probably more than enough for everyone else.","75","409459"
"12929","A demented and often-uproarious class-conscious satire, Parasite falls slightly short of Bong’s greatest work.","75","6751668"
"12930","A simple courtroom drama that never betrays its convictions, the film is a basic but bitterly urgent reminder that history is far more fluid than fact, a garden that must be tended to at all times lest it wither and grow weeds.","75","4645330"
"12931","If Out of Africa falls short of greatness, its fault lies in the politeness of one and all. Except for a brief argument between Streep and Redford, everyone remains deucedly civil. You find yourself hoping that someone - anyone - would just stand up and yell. [30 Dec 1985]","75","89755"
"12932","Crystal is such a panic - and normally uptight Patinkin is so attractively relaxed as a Spanish swordsman - that Bride's charms just can't be ignored. [25 Sept 1987]","75","93779"
"12933","Custody doesn’t do much more than plunge the audience into this hellish situation, but it shrewdly understands the bad dad’s pathetic pathology, and the film may resonate for anyone who’s grown up under the unhealthy supervision of a mean bastard. Take that as a sobering recommendation.","75","6002232"
"12934","The inevitable disappointing CinemaScore exit polls aside, it’s worth seeing — if you don’t mind a little insanity in escapism that offers no escape, only the promise of a new fairy tale on another page.","75","5109784"
"12935","The movie's few false notes come from Lumet's script, which can be overly explanatory. Because Demme is opting for present-tense realism, the characters are forced to fill us in on who did what when to whom, why, and how.","75","1084950"
"12936","As luscious as the filmmaking craft here is, it lacks the rude vitality, the unpredictability, the pure American craziness of the films that should have won him (Scorsese) the Oscar: ""Mean Streets,"" ""Taxi Driver,"" ""Raging Bull,"" and ""GoodFellas.""","75","338751"
"12937","The film ultimately succeeds in offering a fresh female-centered perspective on its genre material.","75","3958780"
"12938","Has its cheesy moments but it's bolstered by interesting performances and a final scene not typical of a mainstream movie. Though no ""Fatal Attraction,"" Unfaithful nevertheless is an interesting and worthy film.","75","250797"
"12939","Features some of the best fight and chase footage you'll see all summer.","75","356910"
"12940","(Craven) and his Scream dream team have done a frightfully good job of killing off and wrapping up the popular horror series.","75","134084"
"12941","There are some virtuoso moments (the discovery of the mutilated corpse is extremely well done and blessedly ungraphic), but overall the result is much less than prime De Palma.","75","387877"
"12942","La La Land is magically in tune with its reference points even as falls a few notes short of their greatness.","75","3783958"
"12943","What is undeniably good about Rocky V is that our working-class hero returns to the grimy neighborhood from which he sprang. Seeing a more slender, ""street"" Rocky is a refreshing change of pace from the muscle-bound champ of Parts 3 and 4. [16 Nov 1990, p.C]","75","100507"
"12944","While the movie runs too long and the message grows thin, it’s a sturdy window into the corruption of the judicial process that can send an innocent black man to death row.","75","4916630"
"12945","The story raises hard moral questions relating to the relative value of human lives and the overwhelming debt that may be felt by those who benefit when others sacrifice. But the movie falls short of excellence because it doesn't so much explore these issues as finesse them in an action-filled climax.","75","120815"
"12946","It's almost a great movie. For half of its running time, Anderson maintains a distinct and arresting tone of vague absurdity, and then he loses control and the film begins to dip into silliness. Individual scenes become labored. Yet even at its worst, The Life Aquatic is always interesting -- there's really nothing else like it.","75","362270"
"12947","Much less mawkish and predictable than you might expect.","75","191754"
"12948","If the formula seems a little tired, it still has more sophistication and pizzazz than most action films.","75","120347"
"12949","Has there been a more upfront title since “Snakes on a Plane”?","75","1231587"
"12950","The abundance of visual and verbal wit here ensures that the pleasure of watching Snatch need not be guilty.","75","208092"
"12951","Despite its shortcomings, The World's End glistens with a comedic energy not present in equivalent mainstream blockbusters.","75","1213663"
"12952","Still packs an entertaining punch with its blend of old-movie formulas, new-age philosophies, and video-game visuals. A small amount of new material, added for the 20th-anniversary reissue, is fun to look for but doesn't make much difference to the story or its impact. [Special Edition]","75","76759"
"12953","It's safe, and it's smart, and even though it's lightweight compared to ""Boyz"" and bound to disappoint a lot of Singleton's admirers, Justice demonstrates that Singleton is more than a one-shot wonder. [23 Jul 1993]","75","107840"
"12954","Nolan's strong suits are maniacal schemers and moody character-driven intrigue, both of which make The Dark Knight a sleek (if, at close to three hours, somewhat distended) detective story.","75","468569"
"12955","Considering this is a remake of a superior 1997 Norwegian film, director Christopher Nolan doesn’t create anything nearly as inventive as his Memento, but at least Insomnia is expertly conventional.","75","278504"
"12956","Shot by Charles Lang, one of the greatest American cinematographers to ever live, Charade is some sort of miraculous entertainment, self-aware and self-parodying yet never distancing or detached. Hepburn is the audience’s funny and flighty proxy, allowing us the great pleasure of being seduced by Grant’s unpredictable charmer.","75","56923"
"12957","A couple of scenes directly reference the Iraq war and the Holocaust (where the humans are herded into cattle cars), and this is taking things much too seriously. This is a big blow-'em-up franchise movie. It should not under any circumstances be confused with a Statement.","75","438488"
"12958","One of the most intelligent and terrifying horror films of the 1980s.","75","87800"
"12959","Matsoukas’ fast and furious filmmaking doesn’t always click, but it always crackles with purpose, refashioning the lovers-on-the-lam trope into an emotional black-lives-matter lament, and it deserves to be met on those terms.","75","8722346"
"12960","Solaris, an exploration of outer space and inner anguish, reminds us that science fiction can embrace adult ideas and human drama as well as technology and futuristic action.","75","307479"
"12961","Hook never reaches Nirvana. It doesn't grab the audience, fling it into another world and make people forget where they parked their cars. But it does leave the viewer with a glow, and along the way it has magical moments, even if it's not fully magical as a whole. [11 Dec. 1991, p.E1]","75","102057"
"12962","Pain And Glory has are some beautiful passages ... What’s missing from the movie is any real sense of danger or subversion—qualities that used to basically define this once-radical filmmaker’s work.","75","8291806"
"12963","Downbeat, depressing and heavy as lead, Calvary is nevertheless an unusual film that never bores. Impeccable performances by Chris O’Dowd, Aiden Gillen, M. Emmett Walsh and Kelly Reilly are riveting. And Mr. Gleeson is a bear-like centerpiece of conflicts and contradictions who anchors the floating pieces of the Irish puzzle in faith and doctrine, while mercifully refusing to sermonize.","75","2234003"
"12964","If movies were still silent, Girl With a Pearl Earring would be a near-masterpiece.","75","335119"
"12965","Formulaic, and at times a bit Sundance-by-numbers, it's still hard to deny that the charms of St. Vincent work even if you clearly can see the narrative machinery moving.","75","2170593"
"12966","This is a violent film. It's rougher, in fact, than ""The Hunger Games.""","75","1735898"
"12967","Fallen Angels is proof that Wong will try anything, and the result is an eclectic mix of images and disjointed editing, sounds and rhythms that are at times as powerful as any piece of filmmaking likely to be seen all year. It can also, every once in awhile, be tedious and trying.","75","112913"
"12968","You have never seen a movie quite like this one.","75","383028"
"12969","Aster displays proficient skill in eerie tone-setting, elaborate production design, and the type of scares that will leave a pervasive imprint on the mind, even if the underlying mythology gets over-complicated by the finale.","75","7784604"
"12970","Rush hits a few potholes, but in the end it reveals the psyches of two men who only feel alive when they're cheating death.","75","1979320"
"12971","An extremely funny movie, and this is coming from someone who barely cracked a smile during ``Friday,'' the first installment of this franchise.","75","195945"
"12972","In Mimic, director Guillermo Del Toro has created a dark, grotesque world that's hard to look at, and impossible to stop looking at.","75","119675"
"12973","A lark from start to finish. [1 July 1987]","75","93260"
"12974","More entertaining than Mission: Impossible or the last Bond film, Goldeneye, it brings back the humour and sang-froid that makes the genre work.","75","120053"
"12975","Rousing in spirit, surprisingly emotional and visually dynamic, filmmaker Ryan Coogler’s first studio movie, Creed, is a worthy successor to the best of the “Rocky” movies and proves the young director is the real deal.","75","3076658"
"12976","A well-made movie. I cared about the characters. I felt for them. Liberate them from the plot's destiny, which is an anvil around their necks, and you might have something.","75","1403981"
"12977","This is a movie that knows it is absurd, and does little to deny it.","75","118880"
"12978","This is one of the best political thrillers of the 1970s.","75","71970"
"12979","Check your brains at the popcorn stand and hang on for a spectacular ride.","75","120755"
"12980","The situational humor is more varied than in In The Loop, even if it still largely comes down to a lot of people badgering each other in hallways, offices, and banquet halls. But the dialogue lacks the earlier film’s vicious, creative, lighting-fast profanity.","75","4686844"
"12981","For those who like the director's body of work, appreciate ""The Twilight Zone,"" and have a high suspension of disbelief threshold, The Village is likely to satisfy.","75","368447"
"12982","The Devil's Advocate is a highly-enjoyable motion picture that's part character study, part supernatural thriller, and part morality play.","75","118971"
"12983","For anyone who adores Smith—which is pretty much everyone these days—they will have quite a satisfying ride with this crusty grand dame behind the wheel.","75","3722070"
"12984","It's a ""First Wives Club"" for single guys, giving voice to a whole range of authentic, if not always responsible, attitudes and emotions.","75","117802"
"12985","Let's be honest, killing is this film's business...and business is good.","75","1186367"
"12986","The 23-year-old Evans has been acting just four years, and his near-anonymity makes him well-cast: He's an Everyslacker breezing through life in Santa Monica, the kind of guy who could turn into a hero under the right circumstances or remain a zero the rest of his life.","75","337921"
"12987","Misery is one of the best movies made from a Stephen King story. [30 Nov 1990, p.6]","75","100157"
"12988","Surely there's a middle ground between a Bolshevik-style elevation of history over individual emotion and a Hollywood-style idolization of emotion over impersonal history. Surely it's possible to avoid either deifying or demonizing history, but rather to seek an understanding of it - as a force that shapes private lives even as they shape it. For all its grandeur and beauty, Dr. Zhivago denies the complexity of that exchange.","75","59113"
"12989","Postcards is a mixed bag. There are a number of entertaining moments; however, potentially rich characters and situations wither from lack of development for the sake of the central relationship, which is never wholly convincing.","75","100395"
"12990","All Hollywood and no Homer, but within its limits, it's a vigorous, entertaining movie.","75","332452"
"12991","Playful and energized enough to keep an audience guessing.","75","195714"
"12992","It hasn't got a brain in its body, but it's fun to watch.","75","266915"
"12993","[Verhoeven's] cold, slick, funny, high-powered movie is informed by a humanism this genre almost always abandons in its chase after vigilante splat. [17 Jul 1987]","75","93870"
"12994","Poignant, witty, historically illuminating.","75","119280"
"12995","Works on its own terms, which is more than can be said of most horror films these days. If this is the kind of movie you're looking for, it delivers.","75","389722"
"12996","The film Cloak and Dagger is like a visit to the midway; fast and noisy and a lot of unsophisticated fun. [10 Aug 1984]","75","87065"
"12997","Howard has a wonderful touch with actors, and almost all of them here have their moments. [26 March 1999, Friday, p.A]","75","131369"
"12998","Instead of being drawn into Dragonheart‘s tale of swords and sorcery, I frequently sat there thinking things like Gee, I wonder how much time it took Connery to record his lines. It’s too bad, because in other respects Dragonheart is a corker.","75","116136"
"12999","It is essentially two movies. The better by far (and it’s very good) is the one that feels like a darker Stand by Me — a nostalgic coming-of-age story about seven likable outcasts riding around on their bikes and facing their fears together... Less successful are the sections that trot out Pennywise. The more we see of him, the less scary he becomes.","75","1396484"
"13000","Last week, the American Film Institute named ""It's a Wonderful Life"" the most inspiring movie in the history of the English language. The film was initially a flop, but it's now considered so perfect that nobody would dare remake it - under that title. Folks who see Click will have no trouble connecting the dots.","75","389860"
"13001","Face the Music is a giant party of a movie, made all the more gratifying by the way it sits at odds with the divisive moment that greets its release. Things may be dire (in this movie and IRL) but Bill and Ted’s unbridled enthusiasm as their stumbles through daunting circumstances turn gleeful ignorance into a form of escapism.","75","1086064"
"13002","A surprisingly effective film.","75","225071"
"13003","Indecent Proposal is as relentlessly entertaining as it is silly--so shamelessly over the top that you watch in a mixture of horror and delight as the drama unfolds toward a climax that is truly mind-boggling.","75","107211"
"13004","Almost all of it works as wish-fulfillment fantasy.","75","1219289"
"13005","For all its merits, however, Joker relies on perhaps a touch too much exposition as it attempts to shape a digestible origin story.","75","7286456"
"13006","This is a movie about children that isn't just a children's movie -thoughtful adult accompaniment is strongly advised. [13 Aug 1993]","75","108065"
"13007","George C. Scott's Oscar-winning portrait of the megalomaniacal warrior general is still the glue holding together this blunt study of war as the ultimate human (and dehumanizing) game.","75","66206"
"13008","Near Dark never drags. When it is funny, it can be wonderfully dark, and when it's scary it is wonderfully mean. Bigelow has a rough-trade sensibility that shows through just often enough. None of the romance of the vampire legend for her and Red; just blood and guts and weird trouble from that odd family down the road. The ensemble cast (three of whom, Henriksen, Paxton and Goldstein are veterans of Aliens) treats it all like red-blooded fun, the effects are swell, and Bigelow is just mean enough to bear watching. [9 Oct 1987, p.D1]","75","93605"
"13009","A brazen stunt that pays off. Writer-director Michel Hazanavicius, simultaneously channeling ""Singin' in the Rain"" and ""A Star is Born,"" tells a story about 1920s Hollywood made in the style of that era.","75","1655442"
"13010","The Rise Of Cobra holds to a thrill-ride sensibility that’s unchallenging and more than a little goofy, but exciting and consistently well-managed.","75","1046173"
"13011","Debut director Marielle Heller’s spent a lot of time with this material — she wrote and starred in an off-Broadway adaptation — and her confident direction of Powley, Skarsgård and Wiig, fused with a Polaroid-evocative palette and a glam ’70s soundtrack, makes this an indelible coming-of-age story.","75","3172532"
"13012","Although the film in no way measures up to the features made under Disney's personal supervision, it does contain some far more imaginative and adept animation than the last several post-Walt titles.","75","103639"
"13013","This film, directed by Curb Your Enthusiasm's Robert Weide, makes an entertaining companion piece to his book.","75","455538"
"13014","It's a welcome alternative to the homogenized Hollywood releases that proliferate during the holiday season.","75","1045772"
"13015","While Edgerton’s fractured approach has a frustrating way of compartmentalizing his characters into their own subplots, making it hard for the movie to convey the full sweep of its emotional journey, Boy Erased regards everyone with such raw empathy that even its most difficult moments are fraught with the possibility of forgiveness.","75","7008872"
"13016","The attitudes evinced by most of the characters, and the movie itself, are those of the admiring tourist, and as two-hour tours go, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel goes smoothly.","75","1412386"
"13017","It’s a crowd pleaser of a film, whose powerful musical moments can overshadow any smaller issues within the film.","75","2473602"
"13018","At its best, Fried Green Tomatoes is a pleasantly nostalgic tale wrapped around a murder mystery (which, frankly, isn't all that mysterious). The filmmakers do a decent job of weaving the texture of the thoroughly racist and sexist society within which Idgie, Ruth and the movie's major black characters (played by Cicely Tyson and Stan Shaw) must struggle to preserve their self-respect and, at critical times, their lives. At its worst, the film is unexciting and rambles too much.","75","101921"
"13019","Spielberg's sledgehammer way with emotional moments, never more obvious than here, kills some of the pleasure for adults and robs the movie of the ultimate laurel -- classic status. [2002 re-release]","75","83866"
"13020","Swank is no mere impersonator. Her Amelia, like Maggie in ""Million Dollar Baby,"" is unwavering in her gaze, ambition, and drive... In Nair's evocatively art-directed (and sensationally costumed) film, Earhart comes alive.","75","1129445"
"13021","He (Irving) has been able to capture the quirky tone of the popular novel.","75","124315"
"13022","Serial Mom isn't much of an ensemble piece. More so even than Waters' Divine pictures, it's a star vehicle. The other actors rarely get a chance to do much more than register stupidity, yet it works out because Turner so craftily tunes into Waters' rarefied wavelength. [15 Apr 1994, p.D3]","75","111127"
"13023","Deadly funny.","75","175142"
"13024","Vulgar auteurist Luc Besson finally commits wholeheartedly to his decades-long preoccupation with waifish young women discovering their inner Shiva, spinning the concept out to its most delirious possible extremes.","75","2872732"
"13025","Taking great commercial risks, director Martin Scorsese avoids movie-star performances and the psychological storytelling that Hollywood movies normally thrive on.","75","119485"
"13026","Mrs. Winterbourne doesn't amount to much. But it's such a professional job, done with such glow and verve -- and the people making it seem to be having such an infectiously good time -- that it's hard to resist. Good comedies are easy to love anyway. [19 Apr 1996, p.C]","75","117104"
"13027","What we've got is a mixed though certainly entertaining bag.","75","266697"
"13028","As entertaining as it is amazingly faithful.","75","241527"
"13029","The movie has an epic sweep but an intimate, personal feel. If Changeling lacks the knockout power of, say, ""Million Dollar Baby,"" it proves that Eastwood continues to seek out stories that take him places he hasn't been before -- and the audience along with him.","75","824747"
"13030","The pieces are there for a profound piece of work, and The Song of Names’ high points are worth the occasional narrative slog.","75","1657517"
"13031","Works best of all as a vehicle for Richard Gere, who has simply never looked better or held the screen more securely.","75","174480"
"13032","Creepy and serenely suspenseful, Martha Marcy May Marlene is a riveting study in what it's like to escape from a physically, psychologically abusive cult, and how hard it is to return to normal life after being brainwashed.","75","1441326"
"13033","As violent and primal as “Animal Kingdom,” but not as brisk. The film grinds to a halt in between confrontations. And those shoot-outs are simple, direct and bloody, not “staged” in the Hollywood sense.","75","2345737"
"13034","The aloof, guarded Cumberbatch plays Assange as a mixture of brilliance, hucksterism, ego and naivete. He carries the baggage of an actor who plays “smart,” with a menacing edge.","75","1837703"
"13035","More focused on emotion than adventure, it teases out the possibilities and perils of time travel without embroiling itself in the confusion inherent to the subject.","75","1862079"
"13036","The Lego Movie amuses and never fails to leave the viewer –especially adults — a little dazzled at the demented audacity of it all.","75","1490017"
"13037","Gremlins was hailed as another ""E.T."" It's not. It's in a different tradition. At the level of Serious Film Criticism, it's a meditation on the myths in our movies: Christmas, families, monsters, retail stores, movies, boogeymen. At the level of Pop Movie-going, it's a sophisticated, witty B movie, in which the monsters are devouring not only the defenseless town, but decades of defenseless clichés. But don't go if you still believe in Santa Claus.","75","87363"
"13038","A movie so cheeky, aggressive and bursting with vitality that it can't help being annoying and exhilarating at the same time.","75","203009"
"13039","Like a time-travel movie, but without the time travel, The Mothman Prophecies delights in playing with cause-and-effect relationships.","75","265349"
"13040","Some movies pack such a terrific central idea, even their flaws can’t stop the train. District 9 is one of them.","75","1136608"
"13041","The second act shifts the film from a lazy and comfy litany of introductions to a riveting fantasia of pure cinema, wherein Lee paints an oft-wordless picture of nature's harshness and grace, the perfect arena for Pi to have a Christ-like coming of age.","75","454876"
"13042","Rocky Balboa is not as good as ""Rocky,"" but it allows us to forget the other four sequels, none of which was memorable.","75","479143"
"13043","With a bare minimum of dialogue, and a brutal maximum of scenes depicting near-drowning situations in and around Dunkirk, France, in late May and early June 1940, Christopher Nolan’s Dunkirk is a unique waterboarding of a film experience.","75","5013056"
"13044","Thankfully the creators of this expansive adventure, a crime-solving saga starring a bunny who wants to be a cop, have a bit more in mind than the usual strains of aww-dorable humor and frenetic action.","75","2948356"
"13045","Hate, love, bigotry, empathy and chance are the uninvited guests at Monster's Ball.","75","285742"
"13046","The Company of Wolves is a trifle long, but the sequences of bona fide scariness and beauty compensate for the occasional longueurs, and it's great to be a kid again, as the artists behind the film know; they also know it can scare the hell out of you. Always cry wolf. [20 Apr 1985]","75","87075"
"13047","Peggy Sue is by no means a masterpiece of movie art, but it is an example of the sort of thoroughly enjoyable middle-brow Hollywood picture - clever, thoughtful, literate - that went missing about the time Peggy Sue got married. [10 Oct 1986]","75","91738"
"13048","Newman remains watchable and glamorous throughout, bloody, muddy or coated in torso-flattering sweat, but the film’s efforts to sentimentally humanize him by psychological revelation are clumsy.","75","61512"
"13049","It’s in the music that I Saw the Light best demonstrates how a tormented man named Hank Williams revolutionized the essence of country songs into a joy embraced by millions.","75","1490785"
"13050","Aware of its own cuteness because the dialogue plays by the rules of meta-entertainment.","75","257076"
"13051","Populated with a peerless supporting cast, actors who bring just the right history to their roles.","75","1189340"
"13052","Happily, the climax races to our rescue... Beyond the grasp of most directors, this is tour de force stuff -- definitely meriting the price of admission and almost worth the three-year wait.","75","119396"
"13053","The first all computer-animated feature, which brings a bedroom of playthings to bouncy life, is yummy eye candy spiked with 3-D-style tactile treats.","75","114709"
"13054","The story may be thin, but the project, a feat of stop-motion animation, is made with generous care by the same impressive LAIKA studio artists who conjured up the gorgeous ""Coraline.""","75","1623288"
"13055","One of Eighth Grade‘s greatest strengths is its specificity related to the current generation.","75","7014006"
"13056","If I had to give a two-word review of Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life, it would be: ""Wow! Huh??""","75","478304"
"13057","It Follows worked like gangbusters as an exercise in atmosphere and allusion, but a little less so as an out-and-out supernatural horror, and only at certain times did it achieve a perfect synthesis of the two.","75","3235888"
"13058","I laughed often enough during the screening of Harold & Kumar that afterward I told Dann Gire, distinguished president of the Chicago Film Critics' Assn., that I thought maybe I should rent ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" and check it out.","75","366551"
"13059","Superman is a bastion of blockbuster innocence, a movie that’s a studio product, certainly, but also something that could have grown from one of Smallville’s sun-kissed cornfields.","75","78346"
"13060","The first pleasant surprise of spring, a gorgeous kids’ cartoon with heart and wit, if not exactly a firm grasp of paleontology.","75","481499"
"13061","A vibrant, cinematically radical, and extremely accomplished work which went on to become one of the most celebrated movies ever made.","75","15648"
"13062","The subtlety is the beauty of it.","75","829193"
"13063","Bier’s direction is coolly efficient, which fits the material to a t — anything more ostentatious would just feel wasteful.","75","2737304"
"13064","A stylish thriller so highly strung it zings, gives us Hopkins, an actor at the top of his game, in material that's only middling.","75","488120"
"13065","A tough, smart, ingenious movie that leads its characters into situations where everything depends on their (and our) understanding of human nature.","75","289043"
"13066","A nightmarishly schematic fantasia of guiltless discomfort.","75","69113"
"13067","""Capote"" is serious, deep and unadorned in the manner of the 1967 movie adaptation of the writer's true-crime novel ""In Cold Blood."" And Infamous boasts the high-gloss frivolity of the 1961 film version of Capote's ""Breakfast at Tiffany's.""","75","420609"
"13068","Eastwood is perfect as the bad guy (a thief) you root for.","75","118548"
"13069","The film's highpoint is one of the most remarkably moving sex scenes in all of American cinema, and the irony of it involving bland puppets is hardly lost on Kaufman and Johnson.","75","2401878"
"13070","Both Rudd and Segel have splendid comic timing and their improvised scenes leap out from the script.","75","1155056"
"13071","Realism by nature offends the dogmatic, and Michael Mann, in a writing-directing debut that makes one want to see his next movie instantly, is a devotee of the realistic in factual essentials, if not in esthetics. [27 Mar 1981]","75","83190"
"13072","The film’s compassion for everyday Americans...along with its energetic determination to entertain, enlighten, and infuriate make it a laudable surprise.","75","1596363"
"13073","Webb delivers a film that’s somewhat derivative, but succeeds as a welcome alternative to superhero extravaganzas.","75","460890"
"13074","Call Me by Your Name is a fairly straightforward coming-of-age story that's at its finest in moments when the relationships take on larger meanings than their literal context implies, and Luca Guadagnino finds evocative aesthetic expressions for them.","75","5726616"
"13075","It's riveting moviemaking and a boost for what's left of America's ailing collective life. [20 Dec 1991]","75","102138"
"13076","Has undertones of serious commentary on American violence, thanks to the screenplay by Larry Cohen, who often uses horror-film plots to explore cracks and contradictions in society.","75","183649"
"13077","The most extreme English-language studio release I've seen in years.","75","424136"
"13078","A shamelessly enjoyable retread, an ode to la belle vie that has been well turned on a factory spindle.","75","401445"
"13079","The dazzling animation, catchy songs and Broadway-worthy dance numbers give the film even broader appeal.","75","366548"
"13080","The thorough goofiness the film luxuriates in, as compared to the covert self-seriousness of nearly every teen comedy ever made, sets Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure apart and heads and tails above the glut of its ilk. Most triumphant, indeed.","75","96928"
"13081","While the cinematography and production design give The Double a formidable if not particularly original look, what really sells the movie is its acting. Eisenberg is unshowily brilliant in his dual role.","75","1825157"
"13082","Fans of their grossest stuff needn't fear: The Farrellys are still the guys who put the last three letters in ""crass,"" and their potty humor was too extreme for me once or twice.","75","480687"
"13083","Directed by the Finnish-born Renny Harlin, it's a deft, fluid piece that rushes from one surrealist epiphany to the next, and along the way displays a craft and imagination far above the norms for the genre.","75","95742"
"13084","Neither a masterpiece nor a remake of one, but its wistfulness is infectious, and its melancholy mood lingers for days.","75","230838"
"13085","The movie works well as a straight-out horror yarn, proving that the Hughes Brothers are more versatile than their previous ""ghetto pictures"" suggest.","75","120681"
"13086","In a multiplex filled with empty New Year vessels (take that, Kangaroo Jack), this holdover grabs you hard.","75","307901"
"13087","It's an uncommonly optimistic meditation on death and lament, befitting a filmmaker whose movies (Jerry Maguire, Singles, Say Anything), no matter their subject matter, always double as a celebration of life.","75","368709"
"13088","One of Bogart’s best acting performances. It shows his range – although having normally played an “alpha” character, here he is easily manipulated by the strong-willed Rose.","75","43265"
"13089","On balance, the filmmakers do a terrific job with one of the weaker stories. It's welcome news that Yates is coming back for one of the stronger ones; he's set to direct ""Half-Blood Prince.""","75","373889"
"13090","The Spectacular Now is wise beyond its years, charismatic, measured and authentic in its depiction of the pains, confusions and insecurities of the teenage experience, and while its deliberate rhythm may prove to be a harder sell among the teen crowd, it’s a valuable and honest film that’s worth the investment.","75","1714206"
"13091","Wanted is like a 12-armed heavy-metal drummer after a case of Red Bull, flailing and thundering through two hours of impossible action.","75","493464"
"13092","The dead-serious Man on Fire awakens a genuine sense of bloodlust in the viewer. This is a slick, big-budget, A-list production designed to stoke our basest impulses -- to make us long for, and cheer at, bloody, merciless vengeance.","75","328107"
"13093","Somber and violent but undeniably stylish and unsettling thriller.","75","264616"
"13094","Other than the unsubtle but vivid storytelling, the main joy of 99 Homes is seeing two excellent but very different actors spark off each other for almost the entire runtime, in a brace of performances both brilliant and brilliantly matched.","75","2891174"
"13095","Much of the action is as ponderous as it is predictable. Lector fans will get their fill, but be warned that the menu contains at least two scenes with over-the-top excesses that Hannibal himself might not want to swallow.","75","212985"
"13096","The criss-crossing between drama, thriller, and horror is nothing if not arresting. It is also unsettling.","75","838247"
"13097","Fukunaga, son of a Japanese father and a Swedish mother, is a filmmaker to watch. He has reanimated a classic for a new generation, letting Jane Eyre resonate with terror and tenderness.","75","1229822"
"13098","Sausage Party is definitely not for everyone. Its well-earned R rating guarantees that. But what might prove the often hilarious and startlingly intelligent film’s greatest bar to blockbuster status is the very thing that sets it apart: its ideas.","75","1700841"
"13099","The giant computerized dragon alone is worth viewing. But Dragonslayer profits from spirited direction and camera work plus the expert Richardson at its nucleus.","75","82288"
"13100","The Warriors is a gangland fantasia, cut tighter than a snare drum, made for maximum impact.","75","80120"
"13101","Literature lasts, but sometimes, The Last Station suggests, the ties that bind last, too.","75","824758"
"13102","Frequently funny and occasionally hilarious.","75","122933"
"13103","Flawed but scrappy, confusing yet exhilarating, the Brit-made Lock, Stock is far from a perfect movie. And it's not for anyone squeamish about violence. But it is, like Green Day, a rockin' good time.","75","120735"
"13104","If you can settle into its odd, low-key groove, I think you'll find it's a light pop beverage that goes down easy during one of the lamest blockbuster summers in recent memory.","75","1013743"
"13105","Southern Comfort is a thriller that twists one up in knots, whipping the audience up to a point where they may wish that director Walter Hill would just spring the damn gore already so as to relieve the tension he masterfully coils.","75","83111"
"13106","The movie-calendar equivalent of last July's ""Six Days, Seven Nights,"" this star-powered romance overcomes a shaky start to outpace that passable confection by several runaway laps.","75","163187"
"13107","This intellectual allegory would carry more punch if it didn't slip into melodrama so often, but it marks Aronofsky as an exceptionally promising new filmmaker.","75","138704"
"13108","Foxx is magnetic in the lead, and the subplot in which he bonds with his Saudi police liaison (Ashraf Barhom, giving the movie's best performance) is touching.","75","431197"
"13109","Writers Jim and John Thomas and first-time director Stuart Baird have come up with a surprisingly deft variation on the airplane hijack genre, one that relies on subterfuge and suspense rather than explosives and body counts even though Steven Seagal is in it.","75","116253"
"13110","It looks like a TV ad, or 200 of them strung together, with the same kind of gaudy virtuosity, lavish technique and expensive self-mockery tinging every shot.","75","120591"
"13111","The acting is playful aces all around: Fillion gives good exhausted incredulity, Banks gives good virginal idiocy, and Rooker gives great conflicted monster arrogance even before the aliens get him.","75","439815"
"13112","A quick and clever thriller as nasty as a piece of shrapnel snapping the sound barrier, 48 Hrs. is as violent as it is funny. It is very funny. [03 Dec 1982]","75","83511"
"13113","Forgiving its moments of melodrama, Philadelphia makes emotional power punches out of every smile, embrace and tear in its story of a regular guy contracting AIDS and getting booted out of the law firm that once lifted him to glory. [14 Jan 1994, p.C1]","75","107818"
"13114","Dieter Laser is grand as the doc, a character Christopher Walken would be comfortable doing, and Akihiro Kitamura provides laughs as the first part of the centipede.","75","1467304"
"13115","What it definitely isn't is a biography of David Foster Wallace, much less a celebration of his work and worldview.","75","3416744"
"13116","Works a familiar mine and produces more than a few nuggets. It's a good tonic, if one's still needed, for '80s-style cynicism: Greed is not good.","75","120324"
"13117","A seriously black comedy. Black, because affliction and angst abound. Comic, because this rampant bleakness is presented as nothing more than an amusing bauble.","75","1019452"
"13118","In Aniston's previous film roles, the ""Friends"" star has made little impression, but under the direction of the gifted young Arteta, she's certainly grown to fill the big screen here, and looks ready to leap from TV to film.","75","279113"
"13119","Annihilation isn’t always as consistently well-executed or involving as it might have been, and it’s told in a manner that robs the story of some much needed life-or-death suspense, but overall it’s a bold undertaking that doesn’t play it safe and features some strong performances.","75","2798920"
"13120","This is a mannered comedy, more stylized and theatrical, almost surreal at times, and less accommodating to his trademark brand of razor-sharp dialogue.","75","1667307"
"13121","The best vampire movie I've seen in years.","75","465551"
"13122","Where Caine was like an arsonist in his relationships, Law's Alfie is more like a kid playing with matches -- innocent and genuinely surprised when things start blowing up around him. Law makes Alfie's befuddlement a surprisingly poignant thing to witness.","75","375173"
"13123","Brazil can be enjoyed without knowledge of the behind-the-scenes circumstances but the rich irony of the parallels between Gilliam and his fictional creation, Sam Lowry, add a layer of appreciation to the project that it otherwise lacks.","75","88846"
"13124","Uthaug also manages to work in a few genuinely cool visual tricks, though the dialogue, from a serviceable script by Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Alastair Siddons is strictly standard; a mix of clunky action-movie exposition and winking Indiana Jones-style humor.","75","1365519"
"13125","The cast doesn't treat The Company Men like a slideshow. They take something overly schematic and imbue it with real anxiety, shame, and humility.","75","1172991"
"13126","Mendes nonetheless works this screenplay like a jazz virtuoso plays with a familiar theme such as ""Mary Had a Little Lamb.""","75","169547"
"13127","Directed by newcomer Todd Field, who has a sensitive eye and a knack for storytelling.","75","247425"
"13128","Sex, lies, betrayal and murder set among the gods of the Beat Generation. That's Kill Your Darlings, a dark beauty of a film that gets inside your head and stays there.","75","1311071"
"13129","Geena Davis and her director and husband, Renny Harlin, recover from their ""Cutthroat Island"" fiasco in grand style, and screenwriter Shane Black (""The Last Boy Scout"") juggles jolts and jokes with a mad fervor that almost earns him his $4 million salary.","75","116908"
"13130","The return to an Errol Flynn-style hero, who can swing from chandeliers, fight with two swords at once and ride a horse backward, recalls a movie era both sexier and more innocent.","75","120746"
"13131","Biller’s work is light on its feet, delighting in its own sensuality, basking in gorgeous colors that seem to have bled through the screen from another age, and coyly seducing the audience before hitting them over the head with a hammer.","75","3908142"
"13132","James Franco's The Disaster Artist perfectly conveys the surreal hell of what the production of Tommy Wiseau's The Room must have been like.","75","3521126"
"13133","A major issue is that the characterizations don’t reach very deep and in the absence of a robust context or involving narrative, it’s actually the references to Haneke’s previous films that flesh out what is otherwise a rather perfunctory condemnation of the bourgeoisie equipped with the usual symbolic connotations.","75","5304464"
"13134","All of Scorsese's movies deliver a mixed message, but this one is downright schizophrenic.","75","217505"
"13135","Recalls the pumped-up energy of ""Pump Up the Volume,"" as well as its casting prowess.","75","113243"
"13136","May not be deep, but it certainly is lip-smacking.","75","241303"
"13137","Offers a brew of wondrous chimera combined with the wonders of human nature.","75","330373"
"13138","This is ""Her Hangover,"" a smarter and sweeter stumble to the altar that never quite gets to Vegas, and doesn't seem to mind.","75","1478338"
"13139","For all the undeniable merits, it somehow feels manufactured, and thus, to a degree, calculated - the product not of a collective imagination taking esthetic chances, but of an imaginative collective putting the rivets into a well-wrought plan that can't go awry.","75","110357"
"13140","Grodin is brilliant, though, practically stealing the movie without an extra word or unnecessary gesture. He's an uncommonly talented actor, and it's good to see him in a movie that gives him a chance to show his stuff. [22 July 1988]","75","95631"
"13141","A harsh and thoroughly unromantic examination of the scarring effects of war.","75","418763"
"13142","Lacks the cohesive flow of ""Fantasia"" and suffers from an attention deficit that seems to mark and flaw our current fast-paced technological era.","75","120910"
"13143","Jodie Foster stars, and it's a pleasure, for once, to see her in something entertaining and mindless.","75","258000"
"13144","Never Let Me Go isn't the kind of movie you talk about on the drive home -- it's even better. It's the kind that makes you sit quietly and think, rolling it around in your head and considering the angles.","75","1334260"
"13145","At its most compelling as a conventional character study of an unconventional female lead.","75","5639354"
"13146","Lundgren, an inexpressive actor, is perfect as a graphic cipher: his face was made to be drawn in ink and filled in with broad washes of color. Carefully tended facial stubble trimmed to give him a skull-like appearance, Lundgren is truly impressive as a character defined by emotional emptiness.","75","98141"
"13147","Because Vantage Point is really a concept movie, the actors are not much more than pawns on the chessboard: They move one square at a time.","75","443274"
"13148","The horror and spectacle of medieval battle has never been re-created on film before with such ghastly beauty.","75","151137"
"13149","There is true beauty in the despair that pervades The Place Beyond the Pines, a film plotted out in triptych, a treatise on the moral compromises we all make to protect and provide for our loved ones.","75","1817273"
"13150","It's a good thing that Geoffrey Rush and Johnny Depp are on hand to jack up the acting department. Their characters, two world-class goofballs, keep us interested even during entirely pointless swordfights.","75","325980"
"13151","There is stuff in This Is the End that had me laughing so hard, I sensed new body parts joining in to help out — my pancreas was heaving, my bile ducts ripped.","75","1245492"
"13152","Somehow, Scott manages to balance it all: meditations on being made in god’s own image, the fan service of “Alien Origins: Xenomorphs,” and feminist agency. Balance doesn’t necessarily mean execution though. There’s friction with all these ideas fighting for airtime.","75","2316204"
"13153","It's always a thrill to see what an artist as singular as Jarmusch will do next. I just wish that his foray into the world of the undead had a little more to sink its beautiful fangs into.","75","1714915"
"13154","Truly raunchy but it's more sweetly stupid and silly than anything.","75","165710"
"13155","Mel Gibson and Julia Roberts contribute major star power to the uneven tale, but it never becomes as convincing as a real conspiracy theory should.","75","118883"
"13156","A clever look at con artists and their games of deception.","75","325805"
"13157","In truth, what follows is less disturbing than intriguing – to audiences hip to the mechanics of horror flicks, it's rare fun to be fooled, and this one is pretty damned clever.","75","1220198"
"13158","While Bening is incredible playing a fading Hollywood starlet in Paul McGuigan’s Film Stars Don’t Die In Liverpool, it’s her co-star, Jamie Bell, who might be the film’s real secret weapon.","75","5711148"
"13159","If you're willing to just go with it, An Unexpected Journey is a competent ride, but as a whole it lacks purpose, giving the impression of a television program in its later seasons still chugging along while full aware that it has peaked. Needless to say, ""Hobbit"" fans will find plenty to soak in; others may get the feeling of being bludgeoned by deja vu.","75","903624"
"13160","Individual scenes absorb, and the film lives and dies by its performances, but the macro problem seems to be that The Sisters Brothers can’t quite transcend its imitation atmosphere. Audiard and his cinematographer Benoît Debie nail the Western aesthetic, but neither can grasp the feeling. This wouldn’t be an issue if Audiard had postmodern aspirations, but The Sisters Brothers wants to be in conversation with the genre while still retaining a sincere, unwinking approach.","75","4971344"
"13161","A winning ""Robin Hood and his Merry Doormen"" comedy about getting even. A cast of comedy specialists each deliver their comic specialties to perfection, delivering double-takes and one liners so well that you don't notice how clunky the actual caper in this caper comedy is.","75","471042"
"13162","Measured scene by scene, the film isn't always successful, and its transcendent moments make it easy to wish it could reach that elevated pitch more often. But Cloud Atlas is the sort of work where the big picture matters more than the details. It's an imperfect film of great daring and tremendous humanity, a work of many stories, but a singular achievement.","75","1371111"
"13163","A film with a rich and convincing texture, a drama with power and anger.","75","430308"
"13164","Even as Honey Boy settles into the tropes of a familiar coming-of-age saga, it’s an admirable variation — the earnest attempt by an elusive movie star to bring his mythology down to Earth.","75","8151874"
"13165","Director Tobe Hooper seems to want his homage and his ""Saturday NightLive,"" too. One minute he's reveling in hair-raising terror; in the next,he's dishing up naughty, nasty camp. [9 June 1986, p.5C]","75","91276"
"13166","There are still some astonishingly tender moments, including looks exchanged between Swayze and Moore that seem magically divorced from this summer of exploding jets, severed limbs and homicidal children. [13 July 1990, Friday, p.D]","75","99653"
"13167","In its own way and up to a certain point, 1492 is a satisfactory film. Depardieu lends it gravity, the supporting performances are convincing, the locations are realistic, and we are inspired to reflect that it did indeed take a certain nerve to sail off into nowhere just because an orange was round.","75","103594"
"13168","Comedy really is hard. So it's a kick when a filmmaker gets it right, as Noah Baumbach does in this stingingly funny take on aging.","75","1791682"
"13169","The picture hurtles along, smoothly if not plausibly, and saves some surprises for the last reel. The Predator, it seems, represents that part of the human spirit that responds with pleasure when violence breaks out, whether it is in Central America, the inner city, or the suburban multiplex playing Predator 2. [21 Nov 1990, p.3C]","75","100403"
"13170","A lively, well-made schlock thriller that will doubtlessly be forgotten in two weeks, but in the meantime should provide a few pleasant evenings for fans of the genre.","75","97737"
"13171","A maddening film, maddening in a good way, but maddening nonetheless.","75","804522"
"13172","If The Electric Horseman has a flaw, it's that the movie's so warm and cozy it can hardly be electrifying. The director, Sydney Pollack, gives us solid entertainment, but he doesn't take chances and he probably didn't intend to.","75","79100"
"13173","Wonder Woman achieves touching and powerful moments that are unusual for a movie of this kind.","75","451279"
"13174","Good as the cameos are, however, the lasting draw of the film is its exceptional aesthetic. Gilliam keeps his camera low in a child’s perspective, and wide-angle lenses only exacerbate the magnified sense of scale that everything has.","75","81633"
"13175","With the insight and sensitivity of an insider, The Messenger illuminates the sometimes invisible victims of war -- the survivors -- and a pain that is tolerated but never quite healed.","75","790712"
"13176","Hell's belles! Nicholson's back. And that old Jack magic has us in his spell.","75","94332"
"13177","A whole lot of plot ensues - an entertaining mix of buddy movie, road trip, ""Clash of the Titans,"" archetypal quest and a coming-of-age tale about misfits making their way despite, or because of, absent parents.","75","814255"
"13178","In the end, Suburbia’s greatest strength lies in its assertion of youth as a political state of mind.","75","86589"
"13179","The Hateful Eight may frustrate some of his more literally sanguine supporters, but it’s nonetheless an entertaining piece of dialogue-driven theater — with the occasional rifle-shot to the head.","75","3460252"
"13180","Uneven but endearing.","75","5816682"
"13181","The film's frequent longeurs, compulsive over-explicitness and unshakably morose hero seem like so many insistently ''literary'' qualities, ostentatiously laid over a cute, cartoonish vision that suggests not so much Anne Tyler as the affectionate quirkiness of ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show.'' [6 Jan 1989, Friday, p.A]","75","94606"
"13182","Easy to tumble for. [9 February 1996, p.D4]","75","115639"
"13183","Superbly acted, beautifully photographed, and resolutely warm and fuzzy, SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE is a romantic treat.","75","108160"
"13184","Ace Ventura: Pet Detective marks the ascendance of a new star in film farce, as Jim Carrey elevates this stupid, suprisingly shoddy picture into the comedy stratosphere, mainly thanks to his Gumby-like ability to contort his face and body in the most amazing ways.","75","109040"
"13185","Qualifies as a solid double, maybe a triple.","75","280707"

"13188","Ridley Scott gives it the grand treatment, 157 minutes worth, but in the end, it doesn't stack up as the portrait of an era (the 1970s, in this case) or an important tale of a criminal mastermind.","75","765429"
"13189","Shivers exhibits the major characteristics of Cronenberg's canon, his use of architecture as reinforcement of the film's creepy tone and the deliberate reduction of men and women to a single, compulsively sexual aspect of their identities.","75","73705"
"13190","Titanic is a big-budget spectacle and director Cameron brings it off with high-tech bravura, placing us aboard the ship in real time.","75","120338"
"13191","While great direction isn’t the worst problem to have, the fact that the writing and acting couldn’t quite live up to their gorgeous surroundings hollows the experience of watching it.","75","6423362"
"13192","Begins to take on a striking resemblance to the infamously bad ""Eyes Wide Shut.""","75","142688"
"13193","This alien high school sci-fi tale has clever wit, clever FX.","75","133751"
"13194","At this point, ""The Corruptor"" looks as if it's going to be just a rehash of an early Dirty Harry movie, but it surprises by taking us inside Chinatown, where we discover just how sinister and elaborate the relationships between the police and the businessmen can be. [12 Mar 1999]","75","142192"
"13195","Life can be funny, sad, conventional, unpredictable -- or a pain in the tail. And so can Life, the new Eddie Murphy movie. [16 April 1999, Tempo, p.4]","75","123964"
"13196","The movie has its pleasures, although human intelligence is not one of them. Caesar, to begin with, is a wonderfully executed character, a product of special effects and a motion-capture performance by Andy Serkis, who earlier gave us Gollum in ""Lord of the Rings.""","75","1318514"
"13197","What is missing in depth and philosophical intent is compensated for with humor and humanization.","75","770772"
"13198","There’s little camp or gimmickry to be found, which is refreshing for a sub-genre whose films so often resort to bad jokes and kitsch violence.","75","4530422"
"13199","Ruben’s story may be as oddly illogical as any of his nightmares, but the animation here is a dreamy delight.","75","6241872"
"13200","A frothy comedy with the most adorable buddies since ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.""","75","120032"
"13201","The elegance of Francis Lawrence’s direction, cinematographer Jo Willems’ measured camerawork, and James Newton Howard’s ominous score adheres to a familiar set of beats, but it’s the rare big Hollywood mood piece and mostly satisfying on those terms.","75","2873282"
"13202","For all its emphasis on doomed honour and grim death, Letters from Iwo Jima is also sentimental.","75","498380"
"13203","The scales ultimately tip slightly in favor of style, but when that style is this gorgeous, remembering a movie for the way it looks rather than its plot isn’t necessarily a bad thing.","75","6864046"
"13204","One aspect of the film is befuddling. Alan Krumwiede (Jude Law) is a popular blogger with conspiracy theories about the government's ties with drug companies. His concerns are ominous but unfocused. Does he think drug companies encourage viruses? The blogger subplot doesn't interact clearly with the main story lines and functions mostly as an alarming but vague distraction.","75","1598778"
"13205","Critics seemed to like this less than audiences; personally I had a ball.","75","74281"
"13206","It's not just a feel-good holiday movie, though audiences, especially youngsters, will certainly walk out of it feeling good.","75","349205"
"13207","It's a fine ensemble, and one mark of how well it works is that The Breakfast Club leaves the confines of the library only three times, and yet we never feel claustrophobic. We just feel trapped, like the kids. For much of the film, one or the other is speaking of parents as the alien life form they represent -- ""When you grow up, your heart dies"" is the bitter slogan -- and that feeling of being trapped by youth and yet terrified to leave it informs the movie even at its most raucous. For getting that one element, Hughes deserves a great deal of credit; for getting it into a ""grown-up"" movie, Hughes deserves more work. [19 Feb 1985, p.C4]","75","88847"

"13209","So few unexploitative movies are made about young black men, especially young black gay men, that the overpraise for this frail, sweet, discursive fantasia is understandable – and forgivable. It’s a beautiful film around the edges.","75","4975722"
"13210","Sorkin’s voice dominates the discourse and the film rarely has a chance to catch its collective breath. While you have to give the duo credit for attempting an unconventional structure, it’s a choice that arguably only works thanks to the contributions of a stellar ensemble.","75","2080374"
"13211","Most thrillers of this ilk have no qualms about going past the 120-minute mark, but I think Greengrass and company understood that overdoing it would turn mass excitement into massive headache.","75","440963"
"13212","The effortless depiction of their growing camaraderie and unconscious courtship is one of Harold and Maude‘s great charms, as Ashby and screenwriter Colin Higgins transpose fading ideology into boundless truth across a modest framework of pitch-black exposition and glowingly pastoral aesthetic touches.","75","67185"
"13213","Sex, lies, and videotape discovers a distinctive, laconic rhythm right from the start, thanks to Soderbergh's taste for holding his shots just a bit longer than conventional, slick editing technique would allow. [11 Aug 1989, Friday, p.A]","75","98724"
"13214","The movie is punctuated by comedy that at times verges on slapstick but there's an underlying anger in evidence - anger at the popular mindset that allows movies like ""Transformers"" to flourish while artistic endeavors fail.","75","2562232"
"13215","Even if this new version of ""Hitchhiker"" doesn't quite capture it all, you'll still want to stick your thumb out and catch a ride.","75","371724"

"13221","A hell-for-leather action film with a healthy serving of scares. It really is ""Aliens"" on the open plains, ""Independence Day"" for the nation's centennial, and what the movie lacks in originality and stick-to-your-ribs Western authenticity, it makes up for in pell-mell multiplex entertainment.","75","409847"
"13222","What Blair is trying to do is quite ambitious for his first feature. He alternates moments of high comedy with serious tension and a touch of magic realism for kicks. For the most part, the tone works.","75","5710514"
"13223","Brimming with intriguing concepts and brilliant visual effects, making it a stimulating treat for both the eyes and the intellect.","75","421715"

"13225","An unwholesome but entertaining blend of Grand Guignol and High Tech. Hellraiser is ghastly fun, for the most part, but it is unconscionably silly. [21 Sep 1987, p.1D]","75","93177"
"13226","While it reaches for the stars, director Christopher Nolan's Interstellar is a flawed masterpiece...The story is ever-ambitious, sometimes riveting and thought-provoking, but also plodding and hokey and not as visionary as its cutting-edge special effects.","75","816692"
"13227","Written by William Gibson, who adapted his own short story, and directed by New York artist Robert Longo in his feature debut, Johnny Mnemonic is inescapably a very cool movie. Running at a fevered pace, with laser and light explosions, it introduces a fantastic yet plausible vision of a computer-dominated age.","75","113481"
"13228","In a movie of murky surfaces and deep loneliness, the redemptive surprise of A Single Man is how it becomes a clear endorsement of the Buddy System.","75","1315981"
"13229","Her character, reportedly based on writer-director Lorene Scafaria’s own mother, isn’t drawn with any particular depth or nuance (and the broad New Yawk accent Sarandon tries on is about as authentically Brooklyn as a Sara Lee bagel).","75","4501454"
"13230","The frothy, feel-good Notting Hill is about as enchanting as movies get these days.","75","125439"
"13231","Speaking of young men, newcomer Taron Egerton, playing Harry’s protégé, delivers a star-making performance flush with the kind of charm and unexpected gravitas that no amount of flashy filmmaking can fake.","75","2802144"
"13232","Slightly misshapen and unbalanced, with a few loose ends, a few extraneous dream sequences. But there's something going on all the time.","75","203119"
"13233","Fair Game is an important exposé of corrupt political power gone toxic. It's good enough that it deserves to be better.","75","977855"
"13234","It doesn’t have the most adrenalized action sequences or the deepest origin story. What it has is the balls to mess with the formula and have some naughty, hard-R fun. It’s a superhero film for the wiseasses shooting spitballs in the back of the school bus.","75","1431045"
"13235","The movie is like Doctor Dolittle remade as a therapeutic sudser. By the end, it got to me.","75","1389137"
"13236","Although it's true that a father/son relationship lies at Sanctum's emotional core, the movie is at its best when it highlights the defiance of the protagonists to yield to despair and give up.","75","881320"
"13237","A flipped take on tween-to-teen romance that make it such a minor gem.","75","817177"
"13238","It starts slowly, but builds to a spectacular climax with hearty sound effects and deftly directed stunts.","75","118771"
"13239","Donen's direction here is a trifle trendy and frantic, with sometimes jarring results.","75","62407"
"13240","Luckily, there's enough of the domestic comedy to make the movie work despite its crasser instincts. One of the big surprises in the movie is Selleck's wonderful performance as the bachelor architect. After playing action heroes on TV and in the movies, he now reveals himself to be a light comedian in the Cary Grant tradition - a big, handsome guy with tenderness and vulnerability","75","94137"
"13241","Imagine two movies...The first is a moody thriller about two brothers who pull off a bank job, take a family hostage, and head for Mexico. The second is a garish horror freak-out. The deranged hook of From Dusk Till Dawn is that it starts out as the first movie and turns, on a dime, into the second.","75","116367"
"13242","Edward Scissorhands isn't perfect. It's something better: pure magic.","75","99487"
"13243","Poltergeist is an effective thriller, not so much because of the special effects, as because Hooper and Spielberg have tried to see the movie's strange events through the eyes of the family members, instead of just standing back and letting the special effects overwhelm the cast along with the audience.","75","84516"
"13244","Wonderfully energetic.","75","477347"
"13245","Cult director Sam Raimi has come a long way since giving us killer tree limbs in whichever (I've repressed it) Evil Dead pic had them. With good leads and a few bucks, he's come up with a high-octane revenge piece mentionable in the same breath as its predecessors. [24 Aug. 1990]","75","99365"
"13246","The film's occasional jarring shifts in tone are a liability, but not a fatal one: It's a character-driven piece and the beautifully-crafted characters mask the narrative flaws.","75","112571"
"13247","As pure, outlandish outlaw cinema it's undeniable.","75","1191111"
"13248","Elliott has come up with an ebullient entertainment propelled by garishly jaunty musical numbers, adroitly handled comic banter and an optimistic faith in people's ability to roll with the punches. [26 Aug 1994]","75","109045"
"13249","Working with a doll can't be easy, but Gosling actually makes it feel emotionally real. A scene where he shares an imaginary dance with Bianca, with his eyes closed and a beatific smile on his face, is by itself worth the price of admission.","75","805564"
"13250","The result is a fairly co-ordinated effort that, despite a few miscues, yields a consistently watchable film.","75","985699"
"13251","I wish the truly searing moments in this film were not continually counterbalanced by an overall historical-reenactment stiffness in the presentation.","75","2024544"
"13252","Even if baseball isn't your favorite sport, or if you don't like sports much at all, you'll find something to catch your attention in this smartly made (if unblushingly vulgar) new comedy. [7 July 1988]","75","94812"
"13253","Riffing on Spanish telenovelas, Hitchcock, and film noir, Almodóvar and his production team have put together a slight, but undeniably gorgeous bauble with a simple sort of story that nestles in somewhere between the high and lowbrow.","75","4326444"
"13254","The movie's biggest charm is its unpredictable, offbeat tone.","75","453467"
"13255","The film is an admirable argument for the legitimacy of psychotherapy, especially for the time, played out in an affluent Chicago suburb.","75","81283"
"13256","Washington, Henderson, Davis, and Hornsby are each “holy shit” great in their own ways, the four of them deepening the dynamics they forged together during their time on stage.","75","2671706"
"13257","A cogent, optimistic and mostly entertaining slice of ghetto life.","75","303714"
"13258","For a rookie director, Trachtenberg appears to be a real craftsman, even if what he’s crafting doesn’t add up to as much as you hope it will.","75","1179933"
"13259","Never entirely satisfying as a drama, Crimson Peak is visually dazzling, boasting lively and at times even transfixing performances that keep the story’s blood flowing.","75","2554274"
"13260","While ""Wedding Crashers"" ultimately succumbs to endorsing the mushy romantic clichés that it spends the rest of the time ridiculing, The 40-Year-Old Virgin offers a wiser take on the anxieties, negotiations and expectations that surround love and sex, particularly for people who've been burned before.","75","405422"
"13261","The actors’ hammy performances only compound the amusement of watching a dynasty propped up by largesse fall to pieces at the very thought of actually having to earn their way in life.","75","8946378"
"13262","And so even if you're held (as I was) by the acting, you may find yourself fighting the film's design. It reflects a certain lack of faith in your audience to take a performance as authentic as De Niro's and reduce it to the level of a glorified reach-out-and-touch-someone commercial.","75","99077"
"13263","An exceptionally well-written script, full of unexpected turns and clever reversals, and a trio of deft actors in the principal roles.","75","265208"
"13264","Some people find this twisty and twisted psychological thriller arty and pretentious. I find it arty and provocative.","75","371257"
"13265","Lovely performances from McDormand, Downey and Richard Knox, who looks uncommonly like Little Richard, as a bar owner named Vernon Hardapple.","75","185014"
"13266","Spielberg ever-so-gently presses on the gas of nostalgic idealism enough times that he blemishes what might have been a pitch-perfect movie.","75","6294822"
"13267","I call the movie a thriller, even though the outcome is known, because it plays like one: We may know that the world doesn't end, but the players in this drama don't, and it is easy to identify with them.","75","146309"
"13268","Trashy and disturbingly violent yet fairly zippy and amusingly cast.","75","330793"
"13269","Cunningham's and Woolf's novels are dedicated to capturing a person's essence through the events of a single day, and Daldry's film is faithful to that aim. But the range of life presented here feels constricted; the movie misses the sublime for all of the despair.","75","274558"
"13270","It's not easy to give a character study concerning mental illness the aspect ofa psychological thriller without some notes of exploitation or trivializationcreeping in, and Take Shelter makes a few missteps.","75","1675192"
"13271","This kind of film requires us to be very forgiving, and if we are, it promises to entertain. Angels & Demons succeeds.","75","808151"
"13272","At times darkly funny and at other times depressingly tragic. It's safe to say there aren't any movies out there quite like this one.","75","292644"
"13273","The critique of masculinity is far more thoughtful and compelling than the vague ruminations about war. Nonetheless Cruise's impassioned performance as Kovic is an impressive accomplishment.","75","96969"
"13274","Neither the masterpiece nor the atrocity it will be described as from here on out by fans and critics alike, Jojo Rabbit is pretty funny, mostly fine, and (perhaps worst of all) well-made.","75","2584384"
"13275","The Watermelon Woman is a thoughtful, charming movie that takes its audience along on a journey of self-discovery - without ever taking itself too seriously.","75","118125"
"13276","It is classless, it is tasteless, it is idiotic, it is juvenile and it is something your mother totally wouldn't approve of. But it also is flat-out hilarious, a go-for-broke comedy that not only is the best laugher released so far this summer, but one of the best so far this year.","75","1119646"
"13277","The standard noir trappings are here: the femme fatale, double-crossing, fatalism, broken dreams, innocence betrayed and the rest of it. But Stone pushes it all so far and so relentlessly that it becomes absurdist comedy.","75","120399"
"13278","The story begins to feel more like a series of strung-together anecdotes: an intriguing project, incomplete.","75","5649144"
"13279","Although the film doesn't probe Whale's personality as deeply as it might, the acting is excellent and movie buffs will enjoy its behind-the-scenes references and nostalgic film clips.","75","120684"
"13280","It breaks no new ground, offers no ingenious plot twist and makes no unique character insights. But who cares when the movie is so much fun. [02 June 1992, p.4D]","75","105417"
"13281","An enjoyable piece of hokum – your basic doom-laden parable of metaphysical sci-fi mind control, only with a surprise romantic sparkle.","75","1385826"
"13282","Those who don't go for horror films, period, won't go for this, but those who do will find this one of the more intelligent, better produced outings of late, with a good, continuing stream of sarcastic humor. [30 Oct 1987, p. E13]","75","93777"
"13283","Certain to nauseate a portion of its audience.","75","185937"
"13284","Has everything but a personality. [15 July 1988, Friday, p.A]","75","95016"
"13285","A film taut with cold-war tensions and cloak-and-dagger secrecy. [23 May 2004, p.8]","75","60397"
"13286","In this slapdash production directed by Mel Smith (""The Tall Guy"" but also, alas, ""Radioland Murders""), written by Richard Curtis (""Four Weddings"") and Robin Driscoll, there's just enough unrepentant self-centeredness missing to take the hilariously brutish edge off Bean's game for those who know him.","75","118689"
"13287","Often, Requiem for a Dream is as technically inventive and daring as the Scottish heroin film ""Trainspotting,"" but it has more resonance and feeling. And when Burstyn is on screen, it often becomes heartbreaking.","75","180093"
"13288","The movie is so engrossing as an intellectual puzzle and such a solid thriller in every other department that it's probably actor-proof.","75","1059786"
"13289","Frances Ha turns melancholy and almost painful to watch in its last act as she and we see the dead end dead ahead. And the film doesn’t seem to earn the finale the two of them cooked up for us.","75","2347569"
"13290","Being Human is just that, and it's a profound delight. [06 May 1994]","75","106379"
"13291","Jacob's Ladder is a cheat - but a talented, disturbing, beguiling cheat. We don't know we've been truly had until it's finally over, when the screen fades and the lights rise and we wake up with a start, deliciously unnerved. [2 Nov 1990, p.D3]","75","99871"
"13292","Has two strengths to recommend it: strong character interaction and a viciously accurate depiction of the modern corporate philosophy.","75","385267"
"13293","Horror fans will find plenty to shriek about. Everyone else should keep their distance.","75","387564"
"13294","Sweet-natured, meticulously observed love story.","75","272338"
"13295","Lincoln is built around a magnetic Day-Lewis turn, and the film is a memorable, sometimes stirring look at how even the most righteous bill must struggle, and even cheat, to become a law. It demands a bigger stage than the one it's given here.","75","443272"
"13296","Though the portentous title is taken from the Old Testament -- Elah is where little David took on Goliath -- the film's concerns are painfully timely and forcefully articulated.","75","478134"
"13297","Although an impressive technical achievement, the film itself is a rather overblown and overhyped affair--which, for all its expensive excess, fails to recapture the spirit of the original.","75","91419"
"13298","A hit-or-miss affair that starts out wobbly and then gathers comic momentum.","75","261392"
"13299","A spectacular noir epic that's equal parts murky, bloated, flashy and triumphantly cinematic. Four years after Nolan's ""Batman Begins"" sequel ""The Dark Knight"" rattled audiences with a similar audiovisual overload, the new movie falls into the same rhythm and remains viscerally satisfying even when the story falters.","75","1345836"
"13300","A delightful surprise because despite all the backstage drama, this is a movie that tells stories that work -- is charming, is moving, is funny and looks professional.","75","286162"
"13301","That's what makes This Is 40 so potently, painfully funny, even when it's gross. What other film would dare suggest rectal monitoring as a form of closeness?","75","1758830"
"13302","Amid the action heroics of White Squall, Bridges creates a character of consequence.","75","118158"
"13303","I couldn't help wondering what kind of spiky unpredictability a ""Say Anything"" - era John Cusack would have brought to the character — with or without the requisite Peter Gabriel song.","75","2582846"
"13304","Both actors are tremendous - especially Schoenaerts.","75","2053425"
"13305","While Gone Girl is certainly his slightest film to date, it's nonetheless undeniably gripping. Fincher clearly enjoys turning the screws and rounding the wild corners of the plot from the first frame.","75","2267998"
"13306","Winstead's performance provides a trenchant wakeup call even when the movie can't keep pace.","75","2063781"
"13307","The upside? Visually polished, credibly acted and competently directed courtesy of Ridley Scott, the film is always likable. The downside? Well, it's never anything more than likable.","75","172495"
"13308","Considering Redmayne’s achievement it’s almost shocking that you can argue Vikander gives the more memorable performance.","75","810819"
"13309","This coming-of-age portion is the less interesting half, though it has the more interesting Michael. We have seen Fiennes play an emotionally detached introvert so often that he brings nothing new to the role, apt though he is.","75","976051"
"13310","Hitchcock largely succeeds at pulling back the veil on his off-camera personality. To a larger degree, it reveals the level of influence of his devoted wife and screenwriter Alma (Helen Mirren) on both his personal life and career.","75","975645"
"13311","There’s an innocence to this premise that lends freshness to every vulgar turn.","75","2531344"
"13312","It's visually surrealistic, acted with integrity, so brutal in spots that I averted my eyes.","75","137523"
"13313","Crystal Skull is a fun ride, but if we have to wait 19 years for the next one, that's OK by me.","75","367882"
"13314","Its examination of the cowboy masculinity that leads Brady and his peers to seek a life of thrills and danger only scratches the surface, but you’ll be surprised at how intoxicating and enveloping it is, right down to the on-the-nose metaphors.","75","6217608"
"13315","The Abyss is at its best during such moments of reverie-when the abstract metaphors and the unique physicality of the deep sea setting come together to produce powerful, unvoiced meanings. The film does have its beckoning depths; what it needs is a more polished surface. [9 Aug 1989, Tempo, p.1]","75","96754"
"13316","The story is surprising, the screenplay is witty, and the animation is wonderfully creative. A super sequel.","75","120363"
"13317","A Dry White Season, despite transcendent subject matter, is arousing natural moviegoer interest as Marlon Brando's first screen outing in nine years. To his and everyone else's credit, the actor's undiminished magnetism never overwhelms a no-frills drama inspired by the 1976 uprising in Soweto, South Africa. [20 Sept 1989, p.4D]","75","97243"
"13318","This darkly effective horror drama holds plenty of interest, even for those who find Anne Rice's gothic cult novels unreadable.","75","110148"
"13319","The King of Comedy is not, you may already have guessed, a fun movie. It is also not a bad movie. It is frustrating to watch, unpleasant to remember, and, in its own way, quite effective.","75","85794"
"13320","Shine has a story to reckon with and powerhouse male performances.","75","117631"
"13321","Director Gavin Hood treats the aesthetics of high-tech surveillance as the opaque membrane through which the prosecution of the War on Terror must pass.","75","2057392"
"13322","Johnny Depp’s drunken Captain Jack Sparrow stumbles into yet another seafaring adventure, which has its rocky moments but also offers an engaging tale with family legacies, above-average swashbuckling and a fantastic new villain courtesy of Javier Bardem","75","1790809"
"13323","Sometimes raunchy, but always well-acted. [25 Dec 1981]","75","82089"
"13324","Couple that with actual acting-Statham is the most winning action hero around, and Foster brings some nuance that the script probably doesn't deserve-and it's bloody fun.","75","472399"
"13325","The veteran Baker anchors the proceedings, and you would like to see more of her character.","75","119381"
"13326","This is better than your average bio-pic. The dynamic established between the motivation of Bale’s and Depp’s characters is really what makes this film. Kudos also go out to Channing Tatum as Pretty Boy Floyd.","75","1152836"
"13327","A definite crowd-pleaser, Hustle & Flow has all the makings of a massive cultural phenomenon - if only audiences can get past the whole pimp thing.","75","410097"
"13328","It offers no special insights into its subject, it doesn't connect on any higher level, and it left me feeling vaguely dissatisfied and let down.","75","125664"
"13329","A lot of critics will talk about how the movie is a stripped-down, ""pure"" genrepiece, and there's a lot of truth to that. What may not get as much press is theway stripped-down-ness is an affectation, and always has been.","75","780504"
"13330","The vestiges of Woo's achingly romantic style play badly in this can-do context, while the mayhem is never more -- and occasionally less -- than competent.","75","115759"
"13331","Michael Douglas and Annette Bening head the well-chosen cast, but what gives the movie substance is its willingness to take real stands on real political issues.","75","112346"
"13332","The first movie I'd have enjoyed more asleep. That's not because it put me to sleep, but because it may be the most dreamlike film I've ever seen.","75","318034"
"13333","A movie about people who literally carry a lot of emotional baggage, metaphorically unpack it, and spiritually lighten their loads. By the end, I felt lighter. Which is closer to enlightenment than most movies get.","75","838221"
"13334","This third installment is the loudest, dopiest, and least inventive of the three. But what the movie...lacks in intelligence it makes up for in sheer doom.","75","181852"
"13335","True Romance, which feels at times like a fire sale down at the cliche factory, is made with such energy, such high spirits, such an enchanting goofiness, that it's impossible to resist. Check your brains at the door.","75","108399"
"13336","There's a missing element whose absence, forgive me, I can't help but lament. This is a movie about magic that ultimately lacks the magic of movies.""","75","295297"
"13337","A sequel that’s never subtle, rarely surprising — and as rich, syrupy, sweet and satisfying as a tray of homemade baklava.","75","3760922"
"13338","Although the film depicts a fledgling psychopath salvaging roadkill with his bare hands, soaking them in acid in order to collect their bones and finding himself flirting with murderous intentions on several occasions, Meyers’ drama is paradoxically humane and affecting — a direction few thought was possible when deliberating the essence of a real-life monster.","75","2291540"
"13339","Like all of Anderson’s films (the best of which remain Boogie Nights and Magnolia), Phantom Thread is meticulously crafted, visually sumptuous, impeccably acted, and very, very directorly. But until the final act, this straight-jacketed character study is also pretty tame stuff — emotionally remote, a bit too studied, and far easier to admire than surrender to and swoon over.","75","5776858"
"13340","Fright Night is pleasantly, if effortlessly, well-acted and gently scripted. And when the ghoulish special effects and wry comedy aren't on screen, there's the occasional in-joke for viewer distraction. [06 Aug 1985, p.4C]","75","89175"
"13341","Argo is absurdly suspenseful for both of its hours. I've never been this stressed-out watching people shred documents.","75","1024648"
"13342","I'm not quite sure what David Cronenberg is trying to say in Crash, but whatever it is, he deserves a lot of credit for having the nerve to put it on screen and face the consequences.","75","115964"
"13343","Chuck Norris takes a big leap in his film career with Code of Silence, a solid cops 'n' drug dealers picture filmed last year in Chicago. Norris' big step is that this time he stars in a much more realistic action film, one with a credibility only slightly undone by a few of his martial arts maneuvers at the end.","75","88936"
"13344","This sort of violent comedy — think “True Lies’’ meets “Grosse Pointe Blank’’ — is tough to pull off, but Spanish director Paco Cabezas and screenwriter Max Landis (“American Ultra’’) nail a screwball fantasy vibe that stops just inches short of downright silliness.","75","2091935"
"13345","It's one of those revolting, raunch-fueled movies churned out in their sleep by the Farrelly brothers and Judd Apatow that I usually hate, but with real cleverness, off-center wit and edgy imagination. Imagine an X-rated Three Stooges farce, and you get the picture.","75","1499658"
"13346","Too slick but amusing marital farce.","75","138524"
"13347","The psychological wars that have made the prequels simmer with tightly wound tensions are given their most cutting treatment yet.","75","3450958"
"13348","Carrell has stated in interviews that his accent ""falls someplace between Bela Lugosi and Ricardo Montalban,"" and that's about right.","75","1323594"
"13349","When Molly’s Game is good, it’s very, very good. There are dazzling moments throughout, and it’s clear that Sorkin is having a blast. Much of the film is downright intoxicating, just like the world Molly Bloom found herself in.","75","4209788"
"13350","Bridge Of Spies is one-third courtroom drama and two-thirds Cold War thriller, and while an engaging watch thanks to fine actors and terrific filmmaking, it’s not without its issues.","75","3682448"
"13351","Silly but endearing comedy.","75","852713"
"13352","The movie is more about the events that resulted in Felt becoming Deep Throat than his work in that role. Although not the definitive Watergate movie, it illustrates an aspect of the scandal that to this point has not been given ample attention by filmmakers.","75","5175450"
"13353","This movie probably falls within the purview of a ""love it/hate it"" subgenre of the psychological thriller.","75","366627"
"13354","Prisoners is never less than engrossing. It’ll keep you guessing. It’s just too bad that the last thirty minutes make us feel like the prisoners, here.","75","1392214"
"13355","You can’t feel for anyone when nothing feels real. Memo to Christopher Nolan for future outings: Kill the dream, tell a story.","75","1375666"
"13356","Clooney's films as director often begin with a familiar point A and conclude at a less-familiar point B, deriving much of their interest from the circuitous path required to navigate the shift.","75","1124035"
"13357","Some movie-goers will be more annoyed than surprised by the finale.","75","184858"
"13358","Accept Gravity as pure, popcorn-munching show business fun and nothing else, and you won’t go away disappointed.","75","1454468"
"13359","It gives you everything you ever loved about the series, and blows it out into super-size cinematic proportions.","75","1000774"
"13360","Little Men could have been so much more if its perspective leaned towards the opposite direction.","75","4919484"
"13361","On the surface, The Game is an unusually imaginative thriller that bends its offbeat plot into so many twists that you actually have to pay attention - something few Hollywood movies demand nowadays - to understand its evolution and enjoy the multiple payoffs at the end.","75","119174"
"13362","Hugo Weaving, weaving deftly beneath a fixed plastic grin and Prince Valiant wig as the mysterious avenger in V for Vendetta, both chills and amuses throughout this enjoyable - if occasionally irresponsible - comic-book thriller.","75","434409"
"13363","Even when his scripts aren't working, Shyamalan knows how to frame shots and build suspense. The Happening, even more than his previous films, has a visual elegance and subtlety that helps to overcome the less successful aspects of the plot.","75","949731"
"13364","Often silly but it's an honest, unselfconscious exploration of the conflict between a man's physical and psychological age.","75","974661"
"13365","In Logan, the clawed mutant Wolverine finally gets to slash through the constraints of a kid-friendly PG-13 rating, and the result is bloody, vicious fun. The squeamish will avert their eyes, and young children should not be allowed anywhere near this movie, no matter how many X-Men action figures they own.","75","3315342"
"13366","You couldn’t ask for a more fun summer popcorn movie than White House Down.","75","2334879"
"13367","The crack in the pretty picture of America goes a lot deeper than we thought, thanks to Ray's brooding vision.","75","48545"
"13368","While The Nun has some veritable scares up its sleeve, it’s also proof that sometimes the most terrifying horrors are the ones we don’t understand.","75","5814060"
"13369","Quick and lowdown-delightful. It's also a graveyard or two up in class from the torture films that, in recent years, have redefined horror for the worse.","75","1127180"
"13370","It's a tad too generic to be a slam dunk.","75","199725"
"13371","It doesn’t trivialize Mud to label it Tennessee Williams lite — at least in its romantic notions. Nichols gets good performances out of one and all, but lets himself get so caught up in his sense of place that this potboiler hangs around more than a few minutes after that pot has come to a boil.","75","1935179"
"13372","Stone has a knack for pacing, detail and atmosphere that manages to feel authentic and fancifully allegorical at the same time.","75","1027718"
"13373","The Constant Gardener is difficult to watch, literally. Meirelles' lens leaps and jitters too much, as if it's anxious it might be bludgeoned to death, too.","75","387131"
"13374","This three-hour opus, bearing only the eponymous title of Nixon, is an intriguing ramble through the social psychology of man and country alike. Indeed, the simple dialectics that both animated and marred Stone's earlier work are redeemed here precisely because they're invested in a single, complex personality - consequently, this film is more character-driven than any of its predecessors. [20 Dec 1995, p.C1]","75","113987"
"13375","Helped enormously by Rachel McAdams, whose performance is convincing because she keeps it at ground level; thrillers are invitations to overact, but she remains plausible even when the action ratchets up around her.","75","421239"
"13376","On many levels, it hits its marks -- but it still misses the impact of some shorter, less-ambitious movies that play with our emotions more deftly or deeply, walk their miles, deadly or not, with a lighter, faster, more confident tread.","75","120689"
"13377","The movie is seriously sexy and seriously entertaining.","75","430357"
"13378","With some surprisingly strong character interaction, there's a lot to like about this movie, at least for those willing to look beyond all the bloodshed.","75","110413"
"13379","Life Itself starts out with great promise – a dizzying first act that creates the tapestry of a character’s life by offering a kaleidoscope of moments from his past. It’s poignant, effective, and punctuated by actions that are breathtakingly sudden and unexpected. However, after the strong beginning, the movie takes a conventional turn.","75","5989218"
"13380","Don’t be fooled by its awful title. The Spy Who Dumped Me is the rare secret-agent spoof that doesn’t double-O-suck.","75","6663582"
"13381","So assured and perceptive in its style, so loving, so intensely right, that if you can receive on that frequency, the film is like a voluptuous feast.","75","243133"
"13382","Like many almost-great comedies, 21 Jump Street is frontloaded with the best go-for-broke gags and lines.","75","1232829"
"13383","There's no question about the efficacy of Scorsese's filmmaking prowess, only that he never knows -- or doesn't care -- to slow down and deepen the material.","75","993846"
"13384","Cruise's undeniable star voltage makes it all palatable, and the film is gorgeous to behold and even to listen to, from the rolling green hills to the galloping horses to the ""Lohengrin""-like theme music on the sound track.","75","325710"
"13385","Crass, gross and juvenile in all the best (and worst) ways, Diary is aimed squarely at a tween ""don't touch the cheese"" demographic. And if you don't get it, maybe you're just too old for a good booger joke.","75","1196141"
"13386","What’s lacking in aesthetic cohesion, pacing, and subtlety is made up for in a powerful lead performance and an essential story with compelling religious undercurrents.","75","4196450"
"13387","Reitman and company let actions do the talking for a good two-thirds of the runtime and it’s a true joy to experience. The actors have brilliant comic timing with one another and everyone feels as though they’ve been on the road to cultivate relationships built on respect.","75","7074886"
"13388","Disney has another first-rate animated villain in The Rescuers Down Under: an Australian poacher with the voice of George C. Scott, who looks like a cross between Scott and Jim Varney. [16 Nov 1990, p.4D]","75","100477"
"13389","This represesents the smartest high-budget, high-profile science fiction film to have come along in quite some time.","75","986263"
"13390","This is an unusual source of entertainment.","75","365748"
"13391","Although I liked the first ""MiB"" movie, I wasn't particularly looking forward to this belated sequel. But I had fun. It has an ingenious plot, bizarre monsters, audacious cliff-hanging, and you know what? A closing scene that adds a new and sort of touching dimension to the characters of J and K.","75","1409024"
"13392","With its tongue planted so firmly in its cheek it threatens to poke through at any moment, Army of Darkness marches onto the screen, a whirlwind of madcap humor, gee-whiz special effects and nonstop action. This is the kind of movie a hyperactive 13-year-old with a $12-million budget would make...It's overdone, yes, but also irresistible. [22 Feb 1993, p.E4]","75","106308"
"13393","On the scale of summer action films, this is to the “Transformers” sequel what an Andy Warhol print is to a first-grader’s refrigerator painting.","75","473075"
"13394","Once the action shifts to the dead-eyed denizens of Santa Mira, the remote town that Silver Shamrock calls home, the film becomes a sly and creepy indictment of corporate engineering. It’s not what Halloween fans wanted—and Wallace rubs it in by showing a couple of clips from the original film on TV—but take the Halloween part away and Season Of The Witch is a standalone oddity worth considering on its own terms.","75","85636"
"13395","It's a movie filled with surprises, including one outright kick in the head that qualifies as one of the biggest movie moments of 1992. [18 Dec 1992]","75","104036"
"13396","Not as awe-inspiring as the first film or as elaborate as the second, but in its own B-movie way, it's a nice little thrill machine.","75","163025"
"13397","Bridges brings his 50 years of acting experience to this one captivating, surprisingly moving performance.","75","1263670"
"13398","It’s a corny, old fashioned boy-dog love story, as adorable as anything Walt Disney ever signed off on.","75","892769"
"13399","Unapologetically long and messy, Snowpiercer offers an unhinged ride that's worth the investment for its mixture of batty personalities, consistently impressive visuals and mad swipes at heavy symbolism jam-packed together.","75","1706620"
"13400","It's as existential as a sci-fi/horror film can possibly be. It requires that the viewer slip into a meditative mood and remain there for more than 90 minutes.","75","1441395"
"13401","Portman’s performance carries the day.","75","1619029"
"13402","Note this in your Starlog: Tacky toupees are out. Chrome domes are in. And not only is the future in safe hands, so is the ""Star Trek"" franchise. [22 Nov 1996 Pg.05.D]","75","117731"
"13403","As a Steve Carell comedy, it works. He plays the victim well, the guy romantically in over his head ever better. Surrounding him with people this funny - Ryan Gosling, who knew?","75","1570728"
"13404","The pleasant surprise about Demolition Man is that both the script, and Stallone, are funny; the film blends big-budget action and tongue-in-cheek humor in the way that ""last action hero"" tried, and failed, to do.","75","106697"
"13405","Whether together or solo, Blunt and Miranda are endlessly charming.","75","5028340"
"13406","What I did like unreservedly was the acting. Enid, as enacted by the sometimes astonishing Birch, is one of the more convincing, no-nonsense teens in recent movies.","75","162346"
"13407","A tar-black comedy so caustic it nearly burns a hole in the screen, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri banks a lot on the gale force of Frances McDormand, and nearly pulls it off.","75","5027774"
"13408","The whole movie aspires to set an Annie Hall vibe, especially when Tom keeps trying to re-create, first with her and then with someone else.","75","1022603"
"13409","Despite juggled storytelling, the movie's compelling.","75","315733"
"13410","Winslet and Brolin have wonderful chemistry together, and Reitman makes well-worn metaphors like steamy weather and pie making (the film has been embraced by the American Pie Council) seem newly invented.","75","1967545"
"13411","A wholesome, headlong extravaganza - a sort of North by Northeast sans high style and erotic innuendo.","75","368891"
"13412","Also predictable is the film's simplistic treatment of themes from religion and myth… It's curious that Spielberg and Lucas see these venerated objects not as symbols of divine inspiration but as repositories of a blind, undiscriminating force that can be wielded (like the three wishes from a genie or a magic lamp) by whoever gets their hands on them. [13 June 1989, Arts, p.11]","75","97576"
"13413","It looks fabulous, it uses special effects to create a new world of its own, but it is thin in its human story.","75","83658"
"13414","It's a weird movie, in that spooky/sicko, deadpan way that Lynch's movies always are, and it's guaranteed to repel anyone who likes entertainment wrapped in tidy resolutions and optimistic fade- outs.","75","116922"
"13415","A triumph of technology over humanity, and if it falls short of a completely fulfilling experience, it also achieves the kind of primal emotion movies were invented for: wonder.","75","121765"
"13416","When Spartan is good, it's surprisingly gripping and fresh, and when it's bad, it's just another overcooked Hollywood paranoid thriller.","75","360009"
"13417","Secret Life anchors itself on an oh-so-familiar concept but sparkles most when imagining some of its crazier shenanigans.","75","2709768"
"13418","Now why did I like this movie? It was just plain dumb fun, is why. It is absurd and preposterous, and proud of it.","75","859163"
"13419","What's a little startling about this movie is that all of this works. The Blues Brothers cost untold millions of dollars and kept threatening to grow completely out of control. But director John Landis (of “Animal House”) has somehow pulled it together, with a good deal of help from the strongly defined personalities of the title characters. Belushi and Aykroyd come over as hard-boiled city guys, total cynics with a world-view of sublime simplicity, and that all fits perfectly with the movie's other parts. There's even room, in the midst of the carnage and mayhem, for a surprising amount of grace, humor, and whimsy.","75","80455"
"13420","This is more than enough material for two hours of summer-movie fun, and The X-Files delivers said fun reasonably well. The action scenes are bigger and bolder than their small-screen counterparts.","75","120902"
"13421","The Goodbye Girl itself represents a satisfying step back in the right direction for the purposes of light, optimistic film romance. Its appeal isn't exactly novel, but it is ingeniously and refreshingly traditional. [21 Dec 1977, p.D1]","75","76095"
"13422","This is a comic amusement park ride – a wildly uneven movie that offers tremendous pleasure for the moment, even if it doesn't stand up well to post-screening analysis and scrutiny.","75","118715"
"13423","Pawn Sacrifice certainly whips up a dervish of energy, and as a piece of dramatic entertainment, it's mostly engaging, and features character actors doing very good work.","75","1596345"
"13424","A generally gripping actioner, the film can also be read as a percipient satire of a society irreparably split along lines of class and race.","75","82340"
"13425","Starman is a wonderful film that combines science fiction, road movies, and romance into an engaging, very entertaining whole.","75","88172"
"13426","While one wishes the beats were a touch more oiled, the film’s strengths reside outside the confines of narrative.","75","4364194"
"13427","Win Win is less quirky than ""The Station Agent"" and less soulful (and political) than ""The Visitor,"" but it still does little to buck the trend.","75","1606392"
"13428","Viewers should stay far away unless they have a strong stomach for deliberately disgusting effects.","75","120907"
"13429","He's (Corbijn) a patient, fastidious filmmaker with a great eye-ideal for his subject here-but his austerity doesn't entirely erase the suspicion that he doesn't have much on his mind. His film is a triumph, but it may be a triumph of style over substance.","75","1440728"
"13430","The best thing about The Power of One is that it works as a history lesson. Avildsen and his writer, Robert Mark Kamen, have managed to simplify and sort out the players and their points of view in a way no other film about South Africa has done. It makes painfully clear just how deep the problems run, and how their solution will invariably require an almost evolutionary change in everyone. [27 March 1992]","75","105159"
"13431","While Seven Psychopaths sometimes hits the philosophical shallows, its pleasures still run deep.","75","1931533"
"13432","Brando made one of his most indelible impressions in this relentlessly dramatic, ever-controversial tale of loyalty and betrayal in the world of working-class unions.","75","47296"
"13433","Days of Thunder, the latest Tom Cruise movie, which is a flimsy but nonetheless compelling story of a hot-shot amateur race car driver who wants to make it in the big-time world of championship stock car racing. Good writing by Robert Towne and a host of strong supporting performances complement the on-the-track visuals of director Tony Scott in giving us a sense of the leap of faith that is required by drivers at this level. [29 Jun 1990, p.C]","75","99371"
"13434","Wesley Snipes understands the material from the inside out and makes an effective Blade because he knows that the key ingredient in any interesting superhero is not omnipotence, but vulnerability.","75","120611"
"13435","A summer action movie that has a brain and doesn't let it atrophy? Fan me, I'm fainting!","75","343818"
"13436","Watching Hold the Dark isn’t quite as interesting as ruminating on it afterwards, which is probably both a critique and a compliment.","75","5057140"
"13437","If the script’s epiphanies don’t feel quite as shocking or profound the second time around, it’s still pleasing to watch these beautiful, troubled people move through their equally beautiful spaces: something borrowed, something blue — and with Freundlich’s careful alterations, something new.","75","7985692"
"13438","It is such a rare pleasure to watch three superior actresses practicing their art that the filmgoer almost forgives ""Agnes of God"" for its imperfections. Almost. [7 Oct 1985]","75","88683"
"13439","When a Stranger Calls manages to scare the stuffing out of the audience - the film is authentically terrifying - without pouring more than a demi-carafe of gore. [22 Oct 1979]","75","80130"
"13440","This film transcends its trendy, obvious limitations with enough vitality and vitriol to make it as informative and breathless as it is entertaining.","75","1285016"
"13441","How does all this play out for those of us – i.e., me – who have not been staying up nights fretting over the origins of the X-Men and Women? The answer is: Fairly well.","75","458525"
"13442","Cliffhanger offers us breathtaking mountain scenery, some occasionally gripping action sequences, and a lot of gags--mostly unintentional and mostly courtesy of Sylvester Stallone.","75","106582"
"13443","The film is full of sharp observations about academic contests today, with Tiger Moms and tough-love Dads browbeating the kids from the wings. The ending is kind of a tap-out, but Bateman keeps this clipping along, maintaining the mean streak and potty mouth that makes Bad Words the dirtiest and funniest comedy of the new year.","75","2170299"
"13444","For a while, I resented the sexist, cruel behavior in the film, much of it revolving around the hazing of underclassmen. But gradually, I saw the movie turn into a brash expose of stupid adolescent traditions. [24 Sept 1993]","75","106677"
"13445","Caddyshack has a low-budget look that warmly welcomes the all-important teenage audience. It looks like a film they could have made. And everyone associated with the film—in front of and behind the camera—is aware that he or she is making a frivolous film...That's why Rodney Dangerfield's cornball jokes and spritzing barbs are so perfectly right for the film. These are throwaway jokes for a most disposable motion picture, the kind of film that drive-ins were designed to play.","75","80487"
"13446","Paris, Texas has an undeniable power. There is certainly a sort of transcendence to be found in the sight of Travis, wearing those 40 miles of rough road on his face, finally finding a measure of peace.","75","87884"
"13447","While it's hardly a cohesive experience, individual scenes are brought to life with striking power.","75","87182"
"13448","The result is a fun, explosive, and surprisingly thoughtful action movie that manages to thread the needle between the pyrotechnics of vintage Jerry Bruckheimer and the softer, more forward-thinking demands of contemporary multiplex fare. It may not be as raw as “Bad Boys,” but it’s more human. It may not be as operatic as “Bad Boys II,” but, well, neither was “The Ring Cycle.”","75","1502397"
"13449","Evil Dead 2 is, pardon the expression, consistently lively--a ghoulish splatter comedy that uses wildly excessive gore to provoke the kind of shock that lies between a laugh and a scream. [10 Apr 1987, Friday, p.M]","75","92991"
"13450","An engrossing, marvelously-acted account of the monarchical cousins that suggests their real enemy wasn’t each other — it was the grasping, pushy and ambitious men who surrounded each in her own court.","75","2328900"
"13451","Fire, as this movie makes clear, is nothing if not photogenic, and Howard has done a beautiful job of conjuring both its danger and its deceptive, primal beauty.","75","101393"
"13452","One of those films where you don't know whether to laugh or cringe, and find yourself doing both. It's a challenge: How do we respond to this loaded material?","75","171580"
"13453","It's blackly comic - though the humour creeps up on you slowly, and you're seldom sure if you should really be laughing.","75","104348"
"13454","The pleasure of any Star Trek movie lies in experiencing the familiar mixed with the inventive.","75","111280"
"13455","The movie's screenplay is contrived and not blindingly original, but Barrymore illuminates it with sunniness, and creates a lovable character","75","151738"
"13456","The film is for horny pups of all ages who relish the memory of reading stroke books under the covers with a flashlight. Verhoeven has spent $49 million to reproduce that dirty little thrill on the big screen.","75","103772"

"13458","Some of the more tender moments - Farmer and Marron dancing at a country bar and gently probing each other's secrets - are particularly affecting. Less successful is a sequence purportedly set at the Academy Awards that wreaks of artificiality. The utter fecklessness of the segment is so jarring that it isn't until the climax that The Bodyguard pulls itself together.","75","103855"
"13459","Spielberg has said that in their collaboration, cut short by Kubrick's death, Kubrick had opened his heart as never before. Although the fingerprint of each is upon A.I, there are times when the prints are blurred and merged. And this film will blur the hitherto distinctive profiles of each.","75","212720"
"13460","Imagine the sequel to ""Clueless"" reconceived as a peroxide ""Paper Chase"" and punched up with a valley girl version of ""My Cousin Vinny"" for the climax.","75","250494"
"13461","Gibson, in a disarmingly nimble, fast break performance, makes Nick's new hyperempathy look like the essence of virile panache.","75","207201"
"13462","Is it worth crawling across the broken glass of the initial hour to make it to the balm of the second? That’ll be up to you, as will the incantatory visual style of Waves — a powerful artistic undertow that sucks viewers in and spits them out gasping.","75","8652728"
"13463","Alda's debut as a director is nevertheless impressive, even if he clearly doesn't know what to do with the camera.","75","82405"
"13464","Bitter, brittle, condescending and petty, the titular character of Margot at the Wedding, fabulously played by Nicole Kidman, is a successful short story writer who resents other people's happiness.","75","757361"
"13465","This is a look at the joy, confusion and heartbreak of adolescence that's both culture- and locale-specific and, at the same time, universal.","75","1233334"
"13466","The movie carries a mild PG rating but may be too intense for younger children.","75","1014759"
"13467","An unrepentantly rude, anti-seasonal dish of malice and mischief. Director Terry Zwigoff works from a story that originated with the Coen brothers and passed through at least four writers, including him...The results may leave you aghast or breathless with laughter, but you won't be neutral.","75","307987"
"13468","Can you recommend a horror movie based on its impressive meanness? Meet Nicolas Pesce’s new and improved take on The Grudge, which is often as nasty as you want it to be, its cheesy jump-scares and generic packaging be damned.","75","3612126"

"13472","It would be nice to say that Blast From the Past is, but it ain't exactly. Half-blast is more like it.","75","124298"
"13473","De Bont knows how to edit a pulse-pounding sequence, he knows how to keep the screen white-hot, and he sure knows how to blow things up real good. What he doesn't know is how to slow down - this premise is perfect for him.","75","111257"
"13474","This slick and involving sequel finds Adonis continuing to work through the weight of his father’s death in the ring, follows all the familiar motions revived with Creed. But in the context of this resilient franchise, the movie hits each beat with the calculated precision of its tireless fighter.","75","6343314"

"13477","At first, you may be inclined to reject it outright, but Game Night works so hard to win viewers over that it eventually finds its way to a winning formula.","75","2704998"
"13478","Proof that Allen, who many have dismissed with his last few forgettable films, is still a filmmaking force.","75","416320"
"13479","A film of extraordinary details that adds up to less than the sum of its parts. But, oh, it gives a lovely light.","75","5208216"
"13480","It falls short of brilliant but it's a lot more daring than what passes for ""dark comedy"" these days, and it reminds us that ""feel bad"" comedies may not always be as funny as ""feel good"" ones but, when they work, they can ultimately be more satisfying.","75","1197628"
"13481","It's a joyride until you think about the film's biggest contradiction. How come this movie celebrating the superiority of human feelings over machine precision is most alive when thrilling in the mechanical perfection of the Terminator and T-1000? Inside Terminator 2 beats a human heart. But its soul is that of a killer machine.","75","103064"
"13482","Besides Paquin, who delivers a once-in-a-lifetime performance as the maddeningly inconsistent Lisa, also wrenchingly fine are Jeannie Berlin as the best friend of the deceased and J. Smith-Cameron as Lisa's actress mother.","75","466893"
"13483","Heebie-jeebies are guaranteed.","75","450385"
"13484","The violent story is standard ""film noir"" fare, but Soderbergh treats it with oomph and imagination.","75","165854"
"13485","Really a blistering satire about spin and the manipulation of the media.","75","427944"
"13486","Despite this familiarity-wallow, The Holiday is likable. Really likable, in fact.","75","457939"
"13487","Of course, on some level, no movie about this subject can fail to move us, and Son of Saul has its share of powerful sequences. I wanted it to be great, though, with a largeness of vision to match the awful immensity of its subject.","75","3808342"
"13488","So filled with verve and wit for much of its running time that it's depressing to watch it devolve into genuine foolishness and borderline incoherence in its final act.","75","910936"
"13489","Wilson, who has never made the film in which he convincingly played sincere, turns out to be a wise choice to play John Grogan.","75","822832"
"13490","Malibu's Most Wanted mines a well-worn comedic vein, but does so with a consistent good humor and surprisingly deft touch.","75","328099"
"13491","A wild, self-indulgent but completely captivating extravagance.","75","169102"
"13492","The mechanical beauty and android possibilities of the future excite the filmmaker, and that's where Minority Report becomes an alluring postcard from the edge. But it's an edge over which Spielberg never seems to want to step.","75","181689"
"13493","Tender Mercies is an episodic gem that offers little in the way of action or melodrama but gets by on fine performances (particularly from Barkin and from Duvall, who does his own singing), atmospheric cinematography, and spare, unglamorous writing.","75","86423"
"13494","Rings has moments of edge-of-the-seat excitement, too, such as when the dark riders come looking for Frodo. But it's occasionally tedious when it should be captivating.","75","120737"
"13495","Downsizing is arguably the most flawed of Payne’s work, but despite its apocalyptic overtones, it’s also his most optimistic. The resulting emotional hit of Paul’s final actions — like that of Miles’, Woody’s, and Schmidt’s — is no less moving, either.","75","1389072"
"13496","The film is a boilerplate biopic, but with stunning cinematography and a couple of fierce performances, The Theory of Everything is nothing if not an accomplished and emotional work of cinema.","75","2980516"
"13497","Writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson crafts a plot of manipulation and chance, in which some zigs and zags are more convincing than others. Still, his feel for scuzz, for people living at the raw extremes of appetite, is palpable.","75","119256"
"13498","The writers get the mix just about right, and first-time Bond director Martin Campbell moves things along fairly briskly.","75","113189"
"13499","By far the silliest and most self-mocking of the series, with the interplay between Spock and Kirk veering somewhere between Hope and Crosby and Cheech and Chong, but also one of the most successful.","75","92007"
"13500","Fast and frenetic and so unvarnished that it can make you feel unclean watching it. The film rubs your face in glamour and filth. But in the midst of the blood and hysteria, Kilmer plays Holmes with the dirty-angelic looks and wheedling charm of a seedy golden boy on the brink of doom.","75","335563"
"13501","The film has a dreary, worn quality; much of it is set in winter in Buffalo, N.Y., after all. You know before long that the best you can hope for is that these folks won't kill each other or themselves.","75","775529"
"13502","This movie lets the characters and tropes borrowed from the original Stan Lee comic live and breathe.","75","290334"
"13503","What's surprising is that the film has genuine laughs and smart-aleck asides that will keep even nonfans happy (although it helps if you at least like the genre).","75","489235"
"13504","So jam-packed with self-referential humor, pop culture cameos, and nods to some of the greatest moments in animation, that it's almost impossible not to like it.","75","318155"
"13505","Overall, “Fighting” works thanks to Merchant’s witty screenplay, Pugh’s transformative performance, Vaughn’s inspired off the cuff one-liners (likely improvised) and a cast that clearly respects the Bevis family story.","75","6513120"
"13506","A star vehicle for rapper Ice Cube (who also cowrote and coproduced), Friday is a lighthearted, comedic presentation of the realities chronicled in dramas like ""Boyz N the Hood.""","75","113118"
"13507","In the scenes between mother and daughter in their apartment, the world outside no longer judging every action, new worlds open up. And therein lies the cinema's role in our lives: It reveals what is concealed to others.","75","2258858"
"13508","Succeeds in its modest goals of building tension slowly and generating a handful of legitimate scares. A few people in the audience were laughing during the first half of the film. No one was laughing during the long walk out of the theater.","75","1179904"
"13509","Shampoo refuses to be coy. There's a deep, soulful confusion here that isn't careless with frivolity.","75","73692"
"13510","Works because it's able to draw so many side issues into its central conflict, spreading its concerns culture-wide. [11 Dec 1992]","75","104257"
"13511","This version may not be as stylish or as sparkling as Richard Lester's 1974 outing with Michael York as D'Artagnan, but it's winningly rambunctious and pushes ahead in livelier fashion than the other versions. [12 May 1993, p.48]","75","108333"
"13512","Collateral is a good idea for a movie, backed up by expert execution... It's straight-up entertainment, not something to see and then talk about a month later, but definitely something to enjoy.","75","369339"
"13513","The movie's main strengths are its use of the real United Nations as its prime location and Pollack's ability to stud this movie (as he also did ""The Firm"") with players who do supporting-character equivalents of star turns.","75","373926"
"13514","Gattaca is a welcome throwback to the days of good, low-tech sci-fi, stressing character and atmosphere over computer-generated effects and juvenile thrills.","75","119177"
"13515","Although the story seems disjointed at times, no other war movie has tried so valiantly to convey not only the suffering of combat but the awful fissures it leaves between humanity's ideal oneness with itself and the world we live in.","75","120863"
"13516","The Lost Boys mixes comedy and horror with a dexterity that augments each. Dracula and Peter Pan were antipodal products of the same society: bringing them together has resulted in a marriage that would make Bram Stoker snicker and J.M. Barrie bawl. [1 Aug 1987, p.C5]","75","93437"
"13517","Slight and not exactly memorable, but it moves quickly and has some surprising twists and top-notch performances all around.","75","1622547"
"13518","Get Out feels fresh and sharp in a way that studio horror movies almost never do. It is both unsettling and hysterical, often in the same moment, and it is totally unafraid to call people on their racist bullshit.","75","5052448"
"13519","This is the kind of mad science filmmaking worth rooting for: Aster refashions “The Wicker Man” as a perverse breakup movie, douses Swedish mythology in Bergmanesque despair, and sets the epic collage ablaze. He may not land every big swing, but the underlying vision is hard to shake even when it falters.","75","8772262"
"13520","Fire Walk with Me isn’t what many wanted it to be, it’s easy to accept the film for what it is: a bracing look at incest and rape.","75","105665"
"13521","I enjoyed everything about Moonstruck except for its meandering mid-section. On cassette, with vino accompaniment, it may seem perfect. In theaters, with a diet drink, it still rates as the holiday sleeper. [18 Dec 1987]","75","93565"
"13522","The concluding image of men silhouetted against the dying flares of explosives, as they march to the raucous refrain of the Mickey Mouse Club theme, is masterly, but leaves a viewer curiously discomfited. Whereas ""Platoon"" shattered civilian complacency about that war, Full Metal Jacket is merely numbing. [26 June 1987]","75","93058"
"13523","A pleasant surprise. What looked to be yet another science fiction movie turns out to be one of the year’s few romantic dramas, one which just happens to be set aboard a space ship.","75","1355644"
"13524","Potentially the most controversial movie of 1995 and arguably a masterpiece, this edgy, downbeat film falls somewhere between social document and peep-show.","75","113540"
"13525","The world here is so ugly that only beautiful tracking shots, rich close-ups and adroit handheld work could make it bearable.","75","1365050"
"13526","Fans of the first two films in the series may be a bit dismayed by Day of the Dead's deemphasis of gory action in favor of characterization, but the need to exploit the horror of the situation has passed and the film works by concentrating instead on its implications and possible solution. The standard 1950s sci-fi/horror film conflict between science and the military is also resurrected here, with distinct political overtones.","75","88993"
"13527","The Wachowski brothers are to be applauded for a film that is also nearly as stylishly funny as it is sexy and fast-paced.","75","115736"
"13528","Not a positive triumph, but it does bring a smile to the face and, perhaps in some cases, a tear to the eye.","75","119822"
"13529","The result: a fun and sweet romantic comedy that lands comfortably on the smart side of vacant, along the way offering a pleasant and satisfying holiday diversion for the grown-ups in the room.","75","1230414"
"13530","Roeg shoots every figure in the film like an instructional visual subject, and it levels the philosophical playing field—whether man, or ant, or echidna, or gnarled tree stump, they’re all fodder for the experimental interplay of light, shadow, and space.","75","67959"
"13531","A surprisingly effective thriller.","75","211933"
"13532","The writing is good and the direction rarely flabby, but the real strength of Buckaroo is in a large and enthusiastic cast, led by Peter Weller, who plays the title character with a perfect deadpan. [11 Aug 1984, p.B7]","75","86856"
"13533","I also like that when Our Hero starts swinging from skyscrapers, he's not just emulating Tarzan, but is working out the Newtonian physics of action and reaction.","75","316654"
"13534","Turbo-charged wallbanger with the IQ of a tire iron. But it jumps off the screen with the mindless panache of a good bad movie.","75","232500"
"13535","With that kind of financial imperative it's something of a miracle the Potter films have been, on the whole, good. One or two, very good. One or two (the first two), less good. This one's good.","75","926084"
"13536","Sloane is a nasty piece of work. Yet Chastain draws us in, making us see what the character keeps inside by the sheer force of her fireball performance. There are times when Miss Sloane plays like a pilot for a TV series. No knock on that. If Chastain stars, I'm in.","75","4540710"
"13537","It's Kind of a Funny Story may be the first psych-ward drama to draw on John Hughes movies for tonal reference.","75","804497"
"13538","One of the year's funniest acts of malice.","75","157503"
"13539","Another Year is a stacked deck of a movie that draws a harshly unforgiving, sometimes smug line between boomers who've made good and those who've fallen by the wayside.","75","1431181"
"13540","Has a lot of that winking wit we've come to expect from our post-""Spider Man"" Marvel movies. It has a hunky, self-mocking young star, solid support from a couple of Oscar winners and the slick sheen that state-of-the-art effects can give you.","75","800369"
"13541","The most enjoyable mainstream comedy since ""Sister Act."" It's slim, it's superficial and it hedges every commercial bet in the book. But for some reason, none of this prevents it from being a whole lotta fun. [1 Oct 1993, p.D16]","75","106611"
"13542","Darkly comic tone of heroin-addiction film sets it apart","75","117951"
"13543","With self destruction as destiny, Reitman has made the equivalent of a Roland Emmerich disaster movie writ small, an apocalyptic scenario internalized by a single person.","75","1625346"
"13544","Ultimately, we don't purchase tickets to Will Ferrell movies for their sweeping romantic storylines, but because he makes us laugh. And Semi-Pro offers plenty of reasons to do so.","75","839980"
"13545","The question is: how much should one talented but sensitive individual be willing to suffer for his art at the hands of one brilliant but terrifying bully? The two stars are fully committed to the concept that the pursuit of perfection doesn’t always triumph, and the film pounds in the temples with the feverish tempo of a jazz riff.","75","2582802"
"13546","Even when it's hard to follow, it looks good. The undersea action is visually convincing, and Ramius' submarine, with all its rooms and compartments, is always believable. The moonlit photography in the picture's final scene is stunning. [2 Mar 1990, Daily Datebook, p.E1]","75","99810"
"13547","Samuel Maoz’s Israeli drama Foxtrot is willfully confusing, emotionally chaotic, and occasionally anarchic. It makes complete sense from one angle, but no sense at all from another. In other words, it reflects its subject perfectly.","75","6896536"
"13548","The Flintstones is a big, shiny package of comic nostalgia, as much a theme park as a movie.","75","109813"
"13549","Yet, for all of The Master's laudable elements, it falls short of greatness for one simple reason: the storytelling is unspectacular.","75","1560747"
"13550","There is hardly a thing I can say in its favor, except that I was cheered by nearly every minute of it. I cannot argue for the script, the direction, the acting or even the mummy, but I can say that I was not bored and sometimes I was unreasonably pleased.","75","120616"
"13551","Carrey's jolly green mug carries Mask. [29 July 1994, p. D1]","75","110475"
"13552","All of these criticisms exist entirely apart from the performances of Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight. It is a tribute to them, and to the core of honesty in the screenplay, that Ratso and Joe Buck emerge so unforgettably drawn. But the movie itself doesn't hold up.","75","64665"
"13553","One of the rare action films that needed to be longer. Then changes in mood wouldn't be so abrupt, and director Peter Berg and writers Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan would've had more time to reveal things we want to know.","75","448157"
"13554","Still stands as a gloriously silly and twisted send-up.","75","71853"
"13555","Logan's Run is a vast, silly extravaganza that delivers a certain amount of fun, once it stops taking itself seriously.","75","74812"
"13556","Davis is reason No. 1 the film extracted from Kathryn Stockett's 2009 best-seller improves on its source material.","75","1454029"
"13557","I should have brought a big yellow legal pad to the screening, so I could take detailed notes just to keep the time-lines straight. And yet the movie is fun, mostly because it's so screwy.","75","96874"
"13558","Often a cinematic marvel and often the year's most pungent movie medicine, Beloved always feels as if it's carrying the world's weight, and maybe it is. [16 October 1998, p. 7E]","75","120603"
"13559","""The Debt,"" a very good 2007 Israeli thriller with Cold War and Holocaust connections, earns a nerve-wracking and entertaining Hollywood remake.","75","1226753"
"13560","Imagine: a pseudo-intellectual baseball fantasy loaded up, like a spitter, with seductive sentiment. You can distrust the mix, but still like the movie - and I do. [21 Apr 1989, Life, p.D1]","75","97351"
"13561","Work was never funnier.","75","151804"
"13562","Hellboy II comes across as an original. But being original is not always the same thing as being wonderful.","75","411477"
"13563","Here’s some Disney magic for you: The new Beauty and the Beast actually improves upon the animated classic.","75","2771200"
"13564","Roma is autobiography as autocritique, and in exploring a point of view adjacent to his own, Cuarón appears to have rediscovered his identity as a filmmaker.","75","6155172"
"13565","Affleck is magnificent, but the movie is something less than that, because it can’t completely overcome some built-in challenges.","75","4034228"
"13566","The Beguiled only ever lets its freak flag fly at half mast, and until the end where some very enjoyable archness is allowed to creep in, this Southern Gothic tale of female sexual jealousy feels surprisingly dated.","75","5592248"
"13567","An appealing, offbeat, one-hundred minute diversion for those who really are tired of monsters tearing down buildings and action heroes saving the world.","75","120382"
"13568","I laughed hysterically, but in the interest of balanced reporting, I should add that the guy parked next to me at the screening - a boyfriend who was there under duress - emitted a series of low guttural noises suggesting profound psychological anguish.","75","1212436"
"13569","Director David Fincher, making his feature film debut in strong style, keeps the action fast and furious, though the climactic scenes look an awful lot like the ending of ''Terminator 2.'' It may be just another sequel, but Alien 3 is better than most, and follows nicely after the first two. [22 May 1992, p.3G]","75","103644"
"13570","Munro's stark lily needed none of this gilding.","75","491747"
"13571","The Hudsucker Proxy is the Coens' fifth feature in a decade, and you can see their tremendous artistic growth in every frame of the film. Classically composed, beautifully shot by Roger Deakins (""Barton Fink"") and co-produced by legendary action-flick producer Joel Silver, Hudsucker has technique and visual invention to spare. [11 Mar 1994, p.C3]","75","110074"
"13572","First Reformed is a bleak, punishing movie and the furthest thing imaginable from an easy crowdpleaser. But Hawke juices it with an austere sense of grace.","75","6053438"
"13573","Bob Fosse’s half-confession about what a jerk he was to the women in his life may pull a lot of punches, but there’s just too much art on the screen to completely disregard the effort.","75","78754"
"13574","Shane Carruth’s Upstream Color is a deliberate exercise in swooning obscurity. You either go with its considerable sensory powers or you scratch a groove on your head.","75","2084989"
"13575","The Coens, so cutting to so many of their characters, are gentler with Llewyn, inviting us to wander and wonder along with him as he ponders why he must forever play the jerk.","75","2042568"
"13576","Cedar Rapids has something of the same spirit of ""Fargo"" in its approach to the earnest natures of its small-towners.","75","1477837"
"13577","Though not as great as ""Toy Story 2"" and ""Monsters, Inc.,"" Pixar movies that are the gold standard for family movies, Finding Nemo is visually entrancing.","75","266543"
"13578","Refn has consistently delivered films that have subverted our expectations, and has proven himself a master at stylistic self-reinvention, but this feels like the first time he’s gone back to any particular well.","75","1602613"
"13579","It's an intricate, at times incoherent, but often funny and consistently fascinating trio of stories with the same actors in different but related roles.","75","810988"
"13580","Ford’s attempt to synthesize the two halves of his film into a coherent whole is what sells it all short.","75","4550098"
"13581","When Carrey is doing his thing as the Almighty, histrionically whipping up one miracle after another and relishing the power, ""Bruce"" has you spring-cleaning your lungs with laughter. But you are made to pay for it with a third-act sap-rising that's as thick as the final reels of ""Patch Adams.""","75","315327"
"13582","Veggie Tales is one amusing salad.","75","298388"
"13583","The film boasts fewer guest-star cameo appearances than the first time around but those who are here do a good job, and Miss Piggy's Busby Berkeley-type dance and the water ballet are fun to watch.","75","82474"
"13584","Lion, the first feature directed by Garth Davis, sufficiently realizes the emotional arc built into Brieley’s experience.","75","3741834"
"13585","BvS will please those either waiting for the two main players to lock horns on a movie screen, or those who've just been pining for Wonder Woman forever. And for the nerdier crowds, a fleeting glimpse at other superheroes hints this is the Dawn of something potentially sensational.","75","2975590"
"13586","The punchlines come quick and thick, with little foreplay or consideration for anything other than getting a physical reaction from the audience.","75","80339"
"13587","A richly appointed period piece, it features kingly tantrums, mistresses, bodices, roaring fireplaces, incest, and mutton. It also features sharply enunciated, period-perfect dialogue in which nary a contraction can be heard.","75","467200"
"13588","Though not a perfect comedy, it manages to be quite often laugh-out-loud funny. The film's strong cast, including scene-stealing ""SNL""er Tim Meadows as the school principal, also helps smooth out most of the rough edges.","75","377092"
"13589","The screenplay is a distinct improvement on Crichton's one-dimensional, humorless potboiler. The movie comes closest to thematic coherence in its depiction of something nearly everyone can relate to: the office from hell.","75","109635"
"13590","Lively acting, eye-catching cinematography, and funny dialogue lift this fantasy a notch above the average until love-story cliches and horror-movie shocks bog it down.","75","120791"
"13591","Kent will have you climbing the walls simply by plumbing the violence of the mind. Brace yourself.","75","2321549"

"13596","You have to remind yourself to breathe.","75","1462758"
"13597","It’s a quiet, thoughtful and handsomely mounted film, offering another plum role to Alicia Vikander (“Ex Machina”) as Brittain. Vikander and the film take Britain, and Brittain, from idealism and hope to grim reality and regret.","75","1441953"
"13598","We’re treated to a series of breezy heist/cat-and-mouse montages and a lowkey, conversational charm that are combined to hammer home the idea of how great a feeling it is to love what you do.","75","2837574"
"13599","Lawrence and Cooper have electric chemistry, and the director pulls off one of the most satisfying romantic Hollywood endings seen in years.","75","1045658"
"13600","If Eddie Murphy gets an Oscar for ""Dreamgirls"" later this month, the deciding factor with voters may be his performance in Norbit. It's much more impressive than anything he does in ""Dreamgirls.""","75","477051"
"13601","The film brings Pixar's customary emotional directness to a festive, reverent, and wide-ranging pastiche of Mexican culture.","75","2380307"
"13602","Although the mix of buffoonery and earnestness often doesn't work, it's priceless to see director Otto Preminger (who was Jewish) play a peevish Nazi commander who has his boots put on simply for a phone call to Berlin. [19 Mar 2006, p.32]","75","46359"
"13603","His (Myers) affection for the era and its gaudy, bawdy movies inject this bit of fluff with giddy energy.","75","118655"
"13604","Hancock is not the ideal fit for the queasy mix of fascination, sympathy, and discomfort that Siegel brought to movies like The Wrestler and Big Fan. The Founder is drier than either of those movies, which means it’s less funny but also has even less potential for sentiment.","75","4276820"
"13605","The film is an unambiguous endorsement of violent revolt as the only effective response to such inhuman savagery.","75","4062536"
"13606","Solitary Man makes too good on its title – it’s a fascinating character study isolated within a mediocre film.","75","1294213"
"13607","A story so good that maybe anybody could have turned out something decent.","75","452623"
"13608","Takes startling - and startlingly unpleasant - turns. This is not a film with anything approximating a conventional ending.","75","134119"
"13609","However, this film is (be)head and shoulders above the recently reanimated likes of ""Prom Night"" and ""My Bloody Valentine.""","75","758746"
"13610","Rao avoids high drama, and while there is humor, the film's tone is one of melancholy.","75","1433810"
"13611","Living in Oblivion is a hip, funny, at times oddly sweet little movie that suggests Tom DiCillo has a bright future. [11 Aug 1995, p.3E]","75","113677"
"13612","It's fast-moving, it's got fine special effects, the hero and heroine are pure and quick-thinking, the bad people die badly, and the script draws its fair share of laughs.","75","120696"
"13613","Ends up a few frames short of the perfect horror film, but very few.","75","298130"

"13617","The mechanics of the final showdown are unexpected and yet show an undeniable logic, and are sold by the acting skills of Willis and Pollak.","75","340163"
"13618","Frost/Nixon is wholly absorbing.","75","870111"
"13619","There's a lot to appreciate in Street Kings, a tight, propulsive action thriller, but there's one thing to marvel at, and that's James Ellroy's command of story.","75","421073"
"13620","While Olympus Has Fallen breaks no major new ground in the political thriller genre, Fuqua has directed a sharp, very taut adventure that keeps you engrossed from start to finish.","75","2302755"

"13623","Teacher underutilizes a smartly cast-against-type Timberlake and the perpetually winning Segel, but Diaz ultimately earns a rooting interest in the unlikely redemption of her scheming opportunist.","75","1284575"
"13624","Thor: Ragnarok doesn’t break fresh ground by Marvel standards, but it livens up the proceedings just enough to grease up the wheels of this franchise behemoth as it careens along.","75","3501632"
"13625","Disturbing, visually stunning thriller.","75","209958"
"13626","At its best, Wright's film is raucous, impudent entertainment.","75","446029"
"13627","The film is far from perfect - the soundtrack occasionally chooses the wrong songs, there are times when the acting (especially by the supporting players) falters, and there are scenes (most of them throw-ways) that don't work. Aside from jump-starting so many promising motion picture careers (including Crowe, Heckerling, and members of the cast), Fast Times will always be remembered for one thing: showing respect for and insight into the members of its core audience, something that was as rare in the 1980s as it is today.","75","83929"
"13628","Robert Waller's inexplicably colossal bestseller is transferred to the screen with more art than it deserves, but neither old-fashioned Hollywood craftsmanship nor the massive star power of Eastwood and Streep can compensate for the story's intellectual slightness and emotional implausibility.","75","112579"
"13629","Precious is a bit like having a piano dropped on your head: messy but memorable.","75","929632"
"13630","Fresh music and silly dialogue - those aspects of Purple Rain haven't changed over the years. [Review of re-release]","75","87957"
"13631","Together, all four cast members help draw a line across the narrative—separating when we were watching a mildly engaging depiction of names, dates, and locations, and a hellish, immersive situation with no easy outcome in sight.","75","1091191"
"13632","It's even better as a love story that just happens to make you laugh.","75","1068680"
"13633","The spirited a cappella singing in Pitch Perfect makes a predictable, feather-light coming-of-age film irresistibly fun.","75","1981677"
"13634","Director Claudel makes you wait until film's end to discover why, exactly, Juliette committed her unspeakable crime, and it's the only disappointing aspect of the movie -- the only time I've Loved You So Long traipses into melodrama. But the rest of this utterly absorbing picture never strikes a false note.","75","1068649"
"13635","There's a adrenaline rush even in the problematic finish, an eagerness that drives the filmmaking so that Looper is thrilling to watch even when it falls apart.","75","1276104"
"13636","Both wonderfully complex and weirdly reductive at the same time—a formula, though, that seems as sound an embodiment of the human brain as any other.","75","2096673"
"13637","Wildly ridiculous and thoroughly entertaining thriller.","75","435705"
"13638","Petersen seems to be holding back, telling us about the liberating power of the imagination but never really showing us. Of course, to show us would be to spoon feed the audience, thereby blunting the message and defeating the point. [20 Jul 1984, p.E9]","75","88323"
"13639","If ""Sarah Marshall"" spawned Aldous Snow, maybe there's room for a Sergio Roma vehicle?","75","1226229"
"13640","In catsuits, swimsuits, and skimpy underthings, Saldana is as potently elusive as a shadow can be.","75","1657507"
"13641","A good movie? Hardly. But more than enough to pass a dog day afternoon.","75","244244"
"13642","John Sayles's offbeat western shows how public controversies often overlap with private grudges and conflicting memories.","75","116905"
"13643","At times, Anderson may be too brilliant for his own good, and there is a risk that viewers will tire of the director's relentlessly prowling camera.","75","175880"
"13644","The flick is driven not by special effects or outrageously gory acts of violence, but by its characters. Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley reinvent the crazy scientists playing God, turning in performances that are charming one minute, petulant the next, and ultimately, compellingly hubristic.","75","1017460"
"13645","While You Were Sleeping is a mild romantic comedy rooted in class anxiety, but it's nice to see perennial loser-in-love Pullman (""Sleepless in Seattle"", ""The Last Seduction"") get some. Respect, that is.","75","114924"
"13646","The computer-driven effects are impressive, but the adventure is hampered by a flat screenplay, dull acting, and just a hint as to why the dark side of the Force will eventually transform cute little Anakin into the evil Darth Vader.","75","120915"
"13647","Thanks to a landmark performance by Al Pacino, SCENT OF A WOMAN is an agreeably watchable film. If they'd made it half an hour shorter and re-written the ending, it could have been a great one.","75","105323"
"13648","A high-adrenaline, high-concept action thriller that mixes hot-button issues of privacy and surveillance, easy-to-identify good and bad guys, attention-getting stars, and well-choreographed chase scenes.","75","120660"
"13649","It's the most tension-producing movie out there right now -- in the best way, it's almost unbearable.","75","278435"
"13650","A pleasing but overlong version of the Rocky story told through the character of a put-upon young high school student who learns karate from an old Japanese master to vanquish the local school bullies. There is no reason this simple story should run 2 hours and 10 minutes. Such a running time strains the good will generated by a cast full of likable performances. [22 June 1984, p.12]","75","87538"
"13651","From the start, Bottle Rocket isn't about creating a full-throttle commercial story. It weaves a beguiling web of comedy, pathos and crime. Other debut features have gone down this road, but director Anderson is amazingly at ease with the set-up.","75","115734"
"13652","Modeling his work after the old Warner Bros. gangster movies of the '30s and '40s, and using plenty of shootouts, Van Peebles still manages to instill a highly personal sense of urgency about the need to eradicate the crack trade. That passion flares through the script by Thomas Lee Wright and Barry Michael Cooper, a former addict who coined the phrase ''new jack'' to describe the flashy style of deprived inner-city youth eager to get rich quick by any means. [8 Mar 1991, p.E3]","75","102526"
"13653","A delightfully schlocky horror comedy about a race of vicious, bloodthirsty invading aliens who look like circus clowns - but with very sharp teeth. [15 Aug 2013, p.C01]","75","95444"
"13654","They're a ragtag assembly for sure, and the results aren't pretty. But on a simple mission of entertainment, they get the job done.","75","132347"
"13655","By the end, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly achieves a victory over difficult material, but celebrating that fact doesn't preclude recognizing the story is not a natural for movies and remains an uneasy match.","75","401383"
"13656","It's ""National Lampoon's Family Vacation"" with soul.","75","449059"
"13657","(Duffy) navigates the twisted collision of religious faith and the thrill of the kill, altruism and brutality, with an ingenious mix of humor, horror, mysticism, and just plain hipness.","75","144117"
"13658","If this rousing, technically dazzling movie doesn't get you going, then you probably didn't like football to being with.","75","146838"
"13659","This violent film, typical of Peckinpah's slam-bang action movies, relentlessly depicts ruthless robbery and murder, not to mention adultery, kidnaping, bribery, extortion, and general mayhem. The vivid direction and lightning pace, however, make the film completely fascinating.","75","68638"
"13660","It's those dark visions of destruction that stick, even when Spielberg pushes the script to an unlikely happy ending. Great foreplay, failed orgasm.","75","407304"
"13661","Has a doozy of a surprise ending that doesn't really stand up under close scrutiny - but you'll have so much fun getting there, it's easy to go along with Lee and company for the ride.","75","454848"
"13662","The film's unbelievably precise choreography of action seeks to tap into a universal feeling of powerlessness.","75","3072482"
"13663","The movie tells you right up front you're going to get what you came for: big stars, winking inside jokes and a spin on something so familiar it doesn't matter that you don't buy it for one minute. You're not meant to.","75","240772"
"13664","This is the art-film Carrey: repressed, lovesick, unshaven. Essentially he's doing the same intellectual sad sack played by John Cusack in ""Malkovich"" and Nicolas Cage in ""Adaptation""","75","338013"
"13665","A deliriously, defiantly unfocused headrush, Stick It is primarily an exercise in exercise.","75","430634"
"13666","Filled with scenes both broad and understated, Mudbound may take some time to find an engaging rhythm and poignant depth, but once it does, the powerful last act will not be soon forgotten.","75","2396589"
"13667","Soderberg provides a cornucopia of fizzy, post–New Wave imagery, fitting for a picture that’s pretty much all about surfaces.","75","349903"
"13668","A devilishly fun blow-em-up that pits The Terminator vs. The Fallen One.","75","146675"
"13669","The film tells a compelling story with many of the elements that audiences find appealing. However, 65 years later, there’s little about From Here to Eternity to differentiate it from other well-made productions of its era.","75","45793"
"13670","Good Night, and Good Luck may be simplified history, but it's almost consistently well-crafted.","75","433383"
"13671","The dance sequences are sexy and energetic, more than compensating for a love relationship in the film that is thoroughly illogical and wooden. [22 July 1983]","75","85549"
"13672","The beloved gang's sweet reunion will melt nostalgic adults into laughter and tears, and maybe kids won't mind drippy new Muppet Walter so much.","75","1204342"
"13673","A sequel needs to hit the ground running faster than Divergent does. Find more notes for Woodley's elegantly plain face to express.","75","1840309"
"13674","The film is well-paced and expertly edited, allowing scenes to flow naturally into one another.","75","108330"
"13675","It's a film about dumbing down that has the effect of wising up its audience.","75","215545"
"13676","Bertino's taut, spare thriller is plenty scary without relying on pseudo-historical context. Anchored by convincing performances from Scott Speedman and Liv Tyler, both of whom elevate their roles above the standard horror-movie caricature, this is an enormously unsettling movie.","75","482606"
"13677","A visceral symphony of screeching tires and crushing metal.","75","77474"
"13678","Beaches is worth seeing simply for the production number in which Midler puts her bosom to good use, and watching the buck-toothed, flamingo-haired Mayim Bialik perform as Midler at 11 is so realistic one wonders if magic mirrors have been used.[15 Jan 1989, p.6C]","75","94715"
"13679","From a distance, The Farewell can look scattered, a series of ambling vignettes on the tradition-rooted quirks of modern China and the nature of families divided by culture and space. But there are some bright moments of truth, bittersweetly illuminating the grey spaces we create in our expressions of love.","75","8637428"
"13680","May hit a few wrong notes, but it strikes an emotional chord.","75","243585"
"13681","Asylum tries telling similar tales (twice) and comes up pathetically short in the scare department, but the atmosphere and theatrics of the Amicus presentation make it a more than worthwhile trip down memory lane for die-hard horror buffs.","75","68230"
"13682","Casino Royale mostly succeeds as an introduction to a badder Bond than ever.","75","381061"
"13683","Capernaum is a movie with a lot of dramatic ideas and plot-points, worthy of a miniseries at least, squeezed into a two-hour sausage of misery.","75","8267604"
"13684","Edward Zwick directed this reasonably thoughtful drama, helped by Denzel Washington and Meg Ryan in the main roles.","75","115956"
"13685","A pretty good movie. It just isn't a very good ""Sleuth,"" exactly.","75","857265"
"13686","Does what an exploitation movie should: It gets in, it scares you silly, and it gets out, all while playing fair by the audience.","75","455407"
"13687","Essentially a liberal vigilante film that’s rife with all the contradictions that description implies, Rolling Thunder has a pared, weirdly principled grace that still packs a punch.","75","76637"
"13688","Ingrid Goes West recalls Fear and Single White Female — two films right in the sweet spot of mid-'90s nostalgia that Ingrid's peers love to recall — but is more indebted to Alexander Payne's social comedies, which dwell in the backwash of the American dream.","75","5962210"
"13689","An admirable film, not a great one -- yet. It drags a bit.[Restored version]","75","41959"
"13690","The story is so complicated that the movie can't quite make it clear, but the picture has impressive energy and high-intensity performances from Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito, and Guy Pearce.","75","119488"
"13691","This is the rare film written, directed and edited by women.","75","3062976"
"13692","Stays engaging, chiefly, through the textured, ambiguous performances of Spacey, Moore and Dench.","75","120824"
"13693","Without overlooking It’s a Wonderful Life‘s lapses into populist bathos, it’s necessary to rescue the Frank Capra film from its status as an untouchable American “classic.”","75","38650"
"13694","There are plenty of plot devices to keep the audience on its toes, and Reynor is the epitome of a 21st century lovable antihero, so fashionable these days. He’s hard and grizzled when needed, but soft and playful as well.","75","6017942"
"13695","It's a genre film - the action is fierce and nonstop - with a brooding undercurrent of unease that aims for the complexities of John le Carre.","75","758774"
"13696","The ghost of John Hughes smiles upon Easy A, a film that freely and giddily borrows from and pays tribute to Hughes' famous Holy Trinity of '80s teen angst comedies.","75","1282140"
"13697","Lovely “memory'' film. [2 March 1990, Life, p.4D]","75","95765"
"13698","Ready to Wear is loads of fun, witty and audacious, but you have to be on your toes to follow a serpentine script (by Altman and Barbara Shulgasser) that cleverly interweaves 10 or 12 plot lines. [24 Dec 1994, p.3F]","75","110907"
"13699","It's a film with many strengths, but it's not a knockout. And that's Tarantino's own fault, though not in the first way you might imagine.","75","361748"
"13700","Has a sense of emotional urgency and deep-dwelling grief.","75","253474"
"13701","The Aeronauts serves an important purpose as an aspirational film for young girls who either love science, or whose parents hope they see the movie and understand that women can be just as excited about taking a hero’s journey as any man.","75","6141246"
"13702","The Lost City Of Z won’t be for all viewers, but its delicate devotion to itself is something sure to inspire admiration and obsessives.","75","1212428"
"13703","The best movie I've seen about the Revolutionary War.","75","187393"
"13704","The film manages the extraordinary feat of forcing us to empathize simultaneously with both the potential victim and the potential villain.","75","361127"
"13705","Bogdanovich's warmest film, featuring charming performances from real-life father and daughter Ryan and Tatum O'Neal.","75","70510"
"13706","Silverman, digging so deep into her character that we can feel her nerve endings, is like nothing we've seen before. She's fierce and unerring. No showing off; she just is. This is acting of the highest caliber.","75","3640682"
"13707","A muscular, ardently naturalistic retelling of the ninth-century Anglo-Saxon saga.","75","402057"
"13708","A charmer, a movie whose embrace of cinema is so passionate it could be mistaken for an embrace of life.","75","211915"
"13709","Both smart and shrewd -- it wraps that same comforting message in a thoroughly entertaining package.","75","119217"
"13710","Screenwriter William Monahan has fashioned an intelligent and highly topical epic. Director Ridley Scott has brought it home with banners flying.","75","320661"
"13711","The film is always at least gut-rumbling and keeps its humor in situations that are morose and awkward.","75","5462602"
"13712","Even though it's right there in the title, ""fantastic"" might be a touch hyperbolic in describing director Wes Anderson's stop-motion adaptation of Roald Dahl's The Fantastic Mr. Fox, but only by a whisker.","75","432283"
"13713","Pitch-black and bound to offend anyone who's not on its wavelength, Nick Guthe's entertainingly slick debut is a mordantly funny slice of lust, crime and sleaze life set in the world of L.A.'s industry elite: Call it 9021-noir.","75","425253"
"13714","In the end, Light Sleeper is slightly more optimistic than some of Schrader's earlier works, but it's a tough, hard-nosed film that shows, in small moments here and there, what life in drugs is all about - and it ain't all about fun. [11 Sep 1992, p.3F]","75","102307"
"13715","It all adds up to a terrific, if biased on the side of the winners (Dre and Cube) history lesson, and a thoroughly compelling, very American and utterly modern musical biography.","75","1398426"
"13716","The film has a strikingly unsettling mood that enhances its power and gives it an impact that the story would otherwise lack. Much of the credit, though, must go to Spacek, who so convincingly portrays Carrie's pain and her longing for acceptance.","75","74285"
"13717","The special effects vacillate between defiantly shitty and endearingly resourceful, and Carpenter and O’Bannon's sense of humor covers a similarly narrow ground between Loony Tunes goofiness and dorm-room stoned.","75","69945"
"13718","The appeal of You've Got Mail is as old as love and as new as the Web.","75","128853"
"13719","Now and Then is much better when Hoffman, Ricci, Birch and Aston Moore draw us into their clique, with all their worldly poses and brittle facades. [20 Oct 1995, p.12]","75","114011"
"13720","It's too ridiculous, too flatly acted, too action-packed, too, well, fun.","75","295701"
"13721","The sci-fi thriller Repo Men gets off to a sluggish start. But wait. You have to give the movie time to find its groove and establish its premise.","75","1053424"
"13722","The idealization of the native American existence in The New World, precolonization, is a pleasing fantasy but also timeworn and ahistorical. Surely someone as sophisticated as Malick - who once taught philosophy at MIT and was a Rhodes scholar - understands that he is putting forth a fabrication.","75","402399"
"13723","Extremely Wicked‘s portrayal yawns with a sense of incompleteness.","75","2481498"
"13724","It's also a British comedy, with that singularly British way of being clever and deliriously juvenile all at once, a combination that makes for scathing, laugh-out-loud, big-screen satire.","75","1226774"
"13725","There are a couple of moments in Jerry Maguire when you want to hug yourself with delight. Both of those moments involve the actress Renee Zellweger, whose lovability is one of the key elements in a movie that starts out looking cynical and quickly becomes a heartwarmer.","75","116695"
"13726","Most importantly, Halloween recovers its long-lost gravitas and self-respect. It makes us remember why we loved Carpenter’s original in the first place: It was artful, frightening and supremely well-acted — not “Scream 4.”","75","1502407"
"13727","An ingratiatingly sincere attempt to deal with the complications and contradictions of modern romance.","75","118842"
"13728","A jokey, junky potboiler.","75","363988"
"13729","The latest slacker manifesto, Clerks lacks the grunge artistry of either ""Stranger Than Paradise"" or ""Slacker,"" but it's a fast, likable 90 minutes at the movies.","75","109445"
"13730","It has its flaws, and traditionalists are likely to think it falls well short of its inspiration, but it works on its own terms, it fills the screen with Burtonesque excitement and it strikes me as one of this tepid movie summer's better offerings.","75","133152"
"13731","Sly, sexy Las Vegas fable.","75","318374"
"13732","It's a picture marked by competence, not the boiling-over intensity that Frears and Thompson fans have anticipated. [30 Nov 1990]","75","99703"
"13733","There's no attempt at greatness here, just a fabulously successful attempt at a good crime movie. The Oscar-bait self-consciousness of ""Gangs of New York"" and ""The Aviator"" is gone. In its place is a buoyancy, an impish delight in telling a harsh urban story in the most effective terms possible.","75","407887"
"13734","The loosey-goosey fun might be a bit much at the finish, but it’s still a laugh watching McCarthy try to get back on her feet.","75","2702724"
"13735","Mann, as he showed two years ago in ""The Insider,"" is a wonderfully idiosyncratic storyteller, sketching out a plot line with quick scenes, jumping into the middle of a story and letting us figure out who's who.","75","248667"
"13736","The film's only misstep is its again-used theme (especially when it comes to a woman's rite of passage) of exacting some punishing loss when our heroine pushes to transcend her limitations by seeking a better life.","75","390221"
"13737","For all of its faults, ends up being relentlessly watchable as well, a summertime popcorn spectacle plopped down in the middle of the fall movie season.","75","1190080"
"13738","Temple of Doom doesn't so much pay tribute to the serial adventures of yore as it does embody them. Here, frivolity and evil blithely coexist—and women are a lot more likely to scream than win drinking contests.","75","87469"
"13739","Oblivion is a terrific-looking movie, alternating spare, sterile environments with homey organic ones, and making both look tremendously pretty. Kosinski also handles his action well, with cut-and-dried clarity and edge-of-seat energy.","75","1483013"
"13740","Despite the story’s familiarity, its star manages to turn its many tropes into a winning formula.","75","1196956"
"13741","There is wit and there are explosions, and while none of them represent a step above “Guardians of the Galaxy,” neither do they impugn the memory of one of the freshest and most fun of the Marvel movies.","75","3896198"
"13742","There is a beautiful, surprising, and entirely engrossing film within this movie; it’s just almost impossible to find among the establishing shots of ponds and endless subplots of real-life characters introduced for seemingly no other reason than to help make this movie perfect for sophomore year high school classes.","75","9206798"
"13743","Whenever The Box threatens to crash, Kelly summons up another haunting image or heartfelt, albeit thin, moral inquiry. It’s an unwieldy, ambitious, one-of-a-kind film waiting for a cult to find it.","75","362478"
"13744","The things you can look forward to, however, are the humor, intellectual musing, emotional tumult, superb acting and challenging adult questions.","75","180073"
"13745","What does work in Coming Home are the small, human, unguarded moments. The performances, undeniably appealing, were deservedly praised, Dern and Voight coming off best.","75","77362"
"13746","Francis Ford Coppola's adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel Dracula, is decadent, overpoweringly erotic campiness coupled with soft-core pornography - blood, breasts, buttocks and big teeth. It's daring and those with a taste for the sexily sanguine will find it delightful. But it's not for the prudish. [13 Nov 1992, p.C1]","75","103874"
"13747","A grandiose cinematic invention, cleverly turning the present-day urban American world on its ear.","75","114746"
"13748","Director John McTiernan outdoes the previous ""Die Hards"" (McTiernan directed the first, Renny Harlin the second) with machinery, stunts, noise, bullets and guts. Hand-held camerawork tweaks the audience's sense of anxiety further, and for the most part it works well.","75","112864"
"13749","Best performance, minute for minute, comes from Adriane Lenox, whose cameo as Michael's drug-addled mother is the film's standout.","75","878804"
"13750","Amazing to look at, amazing to listen to, yet just a bit underwhelming to really think about, Sicario Denis Villeneuve's Mexican drug cartel drama is superlatively strong in every conceivable way except story.","75","3397884"
"13751","Denzel Washington doesn’t demonstrate how great he is with first-rate scripts such as “Flight.” He does it by elevating sophisticated pulp like The Equalizer to a higher level.","75","455944"

"13754","Mr. Holland's Opus is all heart. I suppose a brain cell or two might have helped to win over laggards such as me, but no matter. It sure means well and, in a note-perfect world, strikes its basic chords with a naif's true conviction. [19 Jan 1996]","75","113862"
"13755","Fruitvale Station is impressive for a debut, and displays the unimpeachable intent to involve us all in the human story behind a headline. And it certainly displays great promise from its director and accomplished performances from its cast.","75","2334649"
"13756","Frankenheimer doesn't recapture the magic he once created in movies like ""The Manchurian Candidate,"" but he does cook up an effective thriller in the ""French Connection"" vein.","75","122690"
"13757","Unknown is finely tuned pulp filmmaking, a dumb movie with a smart veneer, which is nothing to sneeze at.","75","1401152"
"13758","Winning and losing are relative terms, but this is the first time in forever that Affleck feels like he’s got skin in the game.","75","8544498"
"13759","This compelling-acted film explains, better than any soundbite, why people have taken to the streets, ""occupying"" centers of finance. If their rage is unfocused, Margin Call suggests, that's with good reason. There are no real heroes or villains here, just human beings with human failings making BIG human mistakes.","75","1615147"
"13760","It's a movie benefiting from another sparkling, sexy and emotionally available performance by Natalie Portman.","75","1411238"
"13761","There's a simple magnetism inherent in this kind of filmmaking, and the Coens know how to orchestrate it.","75","86979"
"13762","A fairly close remake of the great 1981 Dudley Moore movie, with pleasures of its own.","75","1334512"
"13763","A diverting and loosely connected series of episodes about the most bizarre screen family of 2004.","75","374900"
"13764","This is a tremendously well written piece of work, with impressively developed characters, with scene after scene that further enriches and deepens our comprehension of their actions, yet never judges any of them. It certainly helps that Farhadi gets quartet of excellent, pitch perfect performances.","75","2404461"
"13765","John Boorman's 1972 film of the James Dickey novel has a beautiful visual style that balances the film's machismo message.","75","68473"
"13766","Idiocracy is too scattershot and compromised to push the conceptual bleakness beyond the realm of lowbrow comedy, though Judge’s cultural ire remains bracing throughout: For all the characters’ slapsticky imbecility, Judge makes it clear that it’s their docile acceptance (read: political inactivity) that makes them true dumbasses.","75","387808"
"13767","Despite its unsavory aspects, Sin City: A Dame to Kill For is always a pleasure to observe, so artfully artificial with its green-screened backdrops and CGI props.","75","458481"
"13768","This Lion King is akin to a revival of an iconic Broadway musical, with an all-star cast and a few welcome improvements but lacking a certain magic and originality.","75","6105098"
"13769","The world of Wall Street is that of a lush soap opera-""Dynasty"" with a moral. It gets the barn burning, all right, but it has no impact. [11 Dec 1987, p.A]","75","94291"
"13770","There are enough pleasures going on in John Wick to elevate it above just another dumb action movie.","75","2911666"
"13771","Cage's great performance is matched by Shue, who becomes the focus by the middle of the picture.","75","113627"
"13772","Minghella does a good job of dashing any lingering image you might have of the Civil War as a conflict fought along neat geometric battle lines with the nobility of Appomattox.","75","159365"
"13773","The atmospherics here are impressive. There's an undertone of comic dread in most of Cox's scenes, so artfully established that you wonder where it came from. In this respect, Cox seems a more playful variant of Wim Wenders, whose Paris, Texas might have been this funny had it not taken itself so seriously. Of course, Cox isn't Wenders -- he doesn't have the narrative skills yet. But Repo Man is without qualification the most interesting film yet about people driving around and getting into trouble. And there does seem to be a metaphor in there somewhere. [4 Apr 1985, p.4]","75","87995"
"13774","They run a gamut of conventions, proving just how much landscape—geographic and narrative—the Western really covers. What they all convey, some more comically than others, is how short and pitiless life could be in this heavily mythologized era.","75","6412452"

"13776","Tom Cruise might have saved his family from apocalypse. But Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn have just saved our summer.","75","396269"
"13777","Despite the gripping action scenes and a mostly witty, mile-a-minute, off-color script, the movie ultimately fails to produce the emotional tug of other films about journalists in war, particularly Roland Joffe's ""The Killing Fields"" and Peter Weir's ""The Year of Living Dangerously.""The script borders on pompous silliness when Boyle launches into a diatribe on American hypocrisy, and unbelievable sentimentality when Salvadoran rebels are shown in heroic poses as Latin American folk songs ring out in the background... Nevertheless, ""Salvador"" still has the gritty, violent quality shared by other films by Stone: ""Midnight Express"" and ""Scarface."" None of these films is easy to watch, but each keeps you glued to the screen.","75","91886"

"13782","The ensemble is perfectly cast (a rarity for this genre) which helps to make the first half a delightful slow burn instead of a check-your-watch-until-the-carnage-starts.","75","2980592"

"13785","The music and camera work are dazzling, and the story has solid sociological insights into a fascinating pop-culture period.","75","120879"
"13786","After months and months of comedies that did not make me laugh, here at last is one that did.","75","129387"
"13787","Formally ostentatious and unrepentantly messy, the film manages to implicitly convey the overdriven, coked-up confusion that many '70s period pieces make painfully overt.","75","1800241"
"13788","Hitman stands right on the threshold between video games and art. On the wrong side of the threshold, but still, give it credit.","75","465494"
"13789","Bringing Up Baby has some delightfully comic sequences, for sure. But I’m less inclined to remember the dynamics of the gag than Grant and Hepburn’s timing.","75","29947"
"13790","The result, if occasionally forced, is also irresistible.","75","1028576"
"13791","Year One has one joke, but it's a good one, played for many variations over the course of an often very funny comedy.","75","1045778"
"13792","If there is any problem with Wes Craven's New Nightmare, it's the fact that analyzing the film is potentially more fun than the film itself. But that's OK, because it means Craven has put enough thought into his work to make it worth thinking about. [14 Oct 1994, p.H40]","75","111686"
"13793","It’s not impossible to give audiences both a puzzle-box narrative and an exploration of life choices and what it means to be human, but the balance just doesn’t play here.","75","2543164"
"13794","The movie is, in short, your money's worth, better than we expect, more fun than we deserve.","75","287978"
"13795","Revolutions, the final installment in the trilogy, parcels things more neatly. You get 45 minutes of the Wachowskis' patented theosophical bong water, followed by an hour of the most muscular, hard-core special-effects rama-lama yet to hit the screen. Only then does Jesus show up.","75","242653"
"13796","Monsters University, the latest Pixar offering, charms in an excessively familiar way that illustrates a troublesome eventuality: Pixar has lost its edge.","75","1453405"
"13797","The illegal goings-on move to New York, where the plot plods until the crew gets together and the movie unleashes its secret comedic weapon: Anne Hathaway.","75","5164214"
"13798","Despite the fine performances from McConaughey and Leto, tightly coiled editing that keeps the story moving and a nicely measured balance between drama and comedy (McConaughey is often a hoot), Dallas Buyers Club still sometimes feels like it's missing one more grace note.","75","790636"
"13799","An overstuffed odyssey that, while disappointing on many levels, has standout performances by Paul Giamatti.","75","1423894"
"13800","She’s a woman gamely surviving the pitfalls and pratfalls of her own desperation and insecurities, and Zellweger creates a hugely sympathetic character.","75","1473832"
"13801","The important thing about Star Trek VI is that it is a good production of a better-than-average script. There are countless chuckle-lines, and the story takes several interesting twists and turns.","75","102975"
"13802","Usually I am so turned off by mayhem that I turn away from the screen during knife attacks and the like. But for some strange reason I wasn't sickened by the violence in Dawn of the Dead. Even when one zombie gets his head lopped off by a helicopter blade...Dawn of the Dead has some staying power. [4 May 1979, p.3-3]","75","77402"
"13803","Both female roles are unexpectedly meaty, so much so that the film loses something once the far more lively Stone is dispatched. Hour one (more satirical) is better all around, though the falloff isn't fatal. [1 June 1990, Life, p.2D]","75","100802"
"13804","A dramatic comedy that is light on plot but generous in spirit, a leisurely, understated film that underscores the ever-present modern guilt while -- oddly, given the weightiness of that central conceit -- boasting a satisfying buoyancy.","75","878835"
"13805","A tormented and tormenting man uses violence to break the historic chain of violence, then bequeaths to his loved ones the most precious gift he can give -- his total silence and perpetual absence.","75","118564"
"13806","The Queen taps into the universal curiosity the world shares toward royal families -- an element of the movie that Frears wisely mines for gentle humor.","75","436697"
"13807","A tricky thriller whose tricks are less important than its riveting leading lady.","75","3631112"
"13808","Robert Redford has shown that he has a real feeling for the West--he's not a movie tourist--and there is a magnificence in his treatment here that dignifies what is essentially a soap opera.","75","119314"
"13809","Burton has trouble sustaining the briskness of the first half. But the brilliance of many individual scenes, and the extraordinary performance by Landau, are more than enough to justify this goofy, tender ode to eccentricity. [7 October 1994, Daily Notebook, p.C1]","75","109707"
"13810","Blanchett, a commanding figure who scowls her way through every argument, gives Mapes an involving screen presence that elaborates on the character's staunch resolve much better than the straightforward script.","75","3859076"
"13811","Sounder is one of the truest examples of a family film ever made and a triumph for all concerned.","75","69303"
"13812","But for director David Cronenberg and the commitment of his actors, A History of Violence might have been a cartoony action film. Its origins are in a cartoon, of sorts -- specifically, in a graphic novel, by John Wagner and Vince Locke.","75","399146"
"13813","Signs is about God and family, too, but it's also about scaring the bejesus out of you -- and on that level it works like a miracle.","75","286106"
"13814","Although the film's frenetic rhythm is reminiscent of an ""Indiana Jones"" picture, visually Schumacher directs it like a musical, turning each image into eye candy, weaving one lush set piece into the next, as if he were the Vincente Minnelli of blockbusters.","75","112462"
"13815","Genre fans will appreciate the blood flow and the gore, and director Anthony Hickox keeps things moving so that there's never a dull moment -- or dull blade. Consider Hell raised.","75","104409"
"13816","The Boxtrolls hold their own on screen, too, and children will fall in love with the creatures' mischievous antics, gurgling language and tendency to use their boxes as both a disguise and a portable bedroom.","75","787474"
"13817","Director Scott, flashy, fluid and at his best in the steely-blue claustrophic battle-training scenes, immerses the viewer in the process.","75","119173"
"13818","The cheesiest thing about it is the punny English-language title with which it’s been saddled. Otherwise, Land Of Mine is tough and admirably grim, turning a harrowing history lesson into a study in how the battles of wartime don’t always cease with the ceasefire.","75","3841424"
"13819","Vintage Terry Gilliam, a pour not to all tastes but one certain to please lovers of ""Time Bandits"" and ""The Adventures of Baron Munchausen.""","75","1054606"
"13820","Pump Up the Volume, an exceedingly well-written teenager-full-of-angst melodrama about a high school student who operates a pirate radio broadcast that criticizes parents and teachers while revealing the turmoil of adolescence.","75","100436"
"13821","Though full of anger and grief, the film is more than just a screed. Greengrass’ docu-real aesthetic doesn’t allow for grandiosity even when he gives in to more heavy-handed impulses. He’s on a soapbox at times, but his message is worth hearing.","75","7280898"
"13822","It's all speed, movement and blood -- lots and lots of blood.","75","187738"
"13823","It's also a case of art imitates life imitates art. If that makes it a tribute to a tribute to a classic, then it is no less enjoyable for that.","75","892318"
"13824","Fonda and Hepburn work gallantly against the mythic: Norman andEthel are specific people, New Englanders, a middle-class pair without anyspecial abilities or beliefs that might ease their slide into the oblivionat the end of life. They are Every Couple, delineated with a sharpnessthat only two consummate professionals working at the peak of their powerscould provide. [18 Dec 1981]","75","82846"
"13825","This movie is a remarkable feat that requires a strong stomach to sit through. I was unaware, prior to seeing it, that it’s based on a true story, and the movie’s coda was that much more powerful for me as a result.","75","4080956"
"13826","There's a certain triteness to the overarching message -- secrets will keep us apart, and the truth will set us free -- but the kind of sweetness and earnestness that's on display in City Island makes such quibbles easy to forgive.","75","1174730"
"13827","Stan & Ollie salutes an under-appreciated comedy duo while exploring the hardships of fading into the limelight; appropriately, the movie itself is rather forgettable even as the actors deliver brilliant performances in every scene.","75","3385524"
"13828","Roach and McNamara fall victim to the occasional phony biopic moment or straight-up moment of didacticism, but overall Trumbo is a lively history about the day-in-day-out drudgery of survival during oppressive times. Screenwriters are so rarely taken seriously by the film industry that it’s a nice switch to watch them be the heroes.","75","3203606"
"13829","The Overlook Hotel is still plenty creepy, as is the crusty naked ghost lady in Room 217. But the adaptation of Stephen King's Doctor Sleep is more likely to keep you awake at night with the fresher stuff than the retreads.","75","5606664"
"13830","Lewis delivers an Oscar-worthy performance as the child-woman who wears tube tops and polyester and matter-of-factly tells the other woman that Early doesn't really whip her. [03 Sep 1993]","75","107302"
"13831","A bravura, resonant performance by Nicolas Cage, combined with some hard questions raised about American responsibility for the worldwide glut of firearms, make the film close to a must-see, if not a must-love.","75","399295"
"13832","The movie never quite stops feeling like Moulin Rouge! written in extra-large block font, or Broadway projected straight onto a big screen, which certainly isn’t bad news if that’s exactly what you love.","75","1485796"
"13833","The violence and mayhem are constant, though the movie's style is refreshingly old-fashioned -- scream- and laughter-inducing, rather than coldly repulsive in the modern fashion.","75","309698"
"13834","Actors Bill Murray and Richard Dreyfuss provide the frenzied fun that highlights What About Bob? a wacky slapstick comedy.","75","103241"
"13835","At its best, Forrest Gump is a gentle, elegiac fantasy about love and trust.","75","109830"
"13836","[Streep] isa pleasure to watch -- and to marvel at -- every second she's onscreen.","75","368008"
"13837","Succeeds at getting the viewer to buy into its premise, thanks to solid, often moving characterizations and the gripping way the plot is spun.","75","186151"
"13838","The film is equal parts I Will Survive and pop martyrdom, instigated by a star so enormous that she could likely bankroll the Department of Defense for the year of 1976 and still have money left over.","75","75265"
"13839","Allen has fun in his imaginary French capital, turning his star-studded cast loose to interpret their characters as they wish.","75","1605783"
"13840","The kind of little film you can get cozy with, laugh at in odd places even when nobody else is laughing - and yet people will not turn around to glower at you because they understand. [12 July 1989, Daily Datebook, p.E1]","75","98635"
"13841","An engaging and initially very promising drama about alcoholism, redemption and forgiveness that grows uneven and long-winded as it progresses.","75","1907668"
"13842","The spookiest thing about Hotel Transylvania 2 is how much funnier, colorful and more original it is this second time around.","75","2510894"
"13843","But what makes Burlesque truly delectable - for the first half, at least, before its going-nowhere storyline really heads south - is its less obvious camp value.","75","1126591"
"13844","All [Tarantino] has to do is trim a full hour out of ""Vol. 1"" and a half hour out of Vol. 2, combine what's left and he'll have something not just amusing and idiosyncratic, but outstanding.","75","378194"
"13845","Would be a mindless action picture, except that it has a mind. It doesn't do a lot of deep thinking, but unlike many futuristic combos of sf and f/x, it does make a statement:","75","238380"
"13846","Karmic influences or not, the new ""Mighty Joe Young"" works. This is one remake that isn't trying to make us forget the original, but seems rather to embrace it and bring it into the present in solidly crafted, family-friendly fashion. [25 Dec 1998, p.C9]","75","120751"
"13847","Two films in one: an intriguing child-disappearance mystery and an uncommonly affecting domestic drama realized by four terrific central performances.","75","120646"
"13848","The narrative is little more than a flimsy envelope -- it's the men and women who are sealed within that make Sling Blade worth watching.","75","117666"
"13849","Richard Linklater's Before Midnight isn't the most digestible picture, but its challenging, funny, painful, very present and alive depiction of relationships at 40 is so honest and real that we wouldn't have it any other way.","75","2209418"
"13850","This clever and original movie is like a John Hughes comedy for the '90s.","75","119229"
"13851","Fans of the director’s late-period work (particularly his last completed effort, the rapid-fire diary film “F for Fake”) will find it thrilling to return to those unpredictable, garrulous recesses, no matter the bumpy ride. Welles continues to contemplate storytelling, Hollywood, and his own troubled career by transforming these obsessions into a marathon of creativity.","75","69049"
"13852","Mistress America is both the most concentrated and antic film in Noah Baumbach's unofficial New York trilogy.","75","2872462"

"13855","A vital film about a bunch of youngsters who view break-dancing as a way out of their dead end lifestyle. For what is essentially a musical exploitation film, Breakin' is surprisingly filled with more human moments and dance scenes than violence or sexuality. [08 June 1984, p.12]","75","86998"
"13856","There are nice bits throughout, and your heart can’t help but go out to these impassioned young lovers whom you know are doomed. But Bright Star is too often tarnished by the ordinary.","75","810784"
"13857","It drifts by with all the force of a mild summer breeze, and — as is typical of Sachs’ jewel-like work — it leaves you feeling like you could have spent another 90 minutes with these characters. For better or worse, this one also leaves you feeling like Sachs could have spent another 90 minutes with these characters, too.","75","8019694"
"13858","Faxon and Rush’s screenplay doesn’t deviate too far from formula, but their sturdy direction, bolstered by handsome production values, evokes a wistful sense of carefree summers and conjures up a potent amount of simmering teenage angst beneath the frequent chuckles.","75","1727388"
"13859","Doesn't always work -- like its title, the movie straddles two separate worlds, landing squarely in the dreaded realm of ""dramedy"" -- but it's a noble effort.","75","371246"
"13860","A summer movie that staggers down that fine line between sentimental and snarky, a tale of nature and nurture and first love that manages to charm more than any R-rated movie about horny teens has a right to.","75","2179116"
"13861","Rarely do we see a filmmaker start so strong only to end with a whimper. All in all, though, Baby Driver is still worth seeking out, if only for that first hour. Inside those opening 60 minutes is the best action-comedy of the last ten years — full stop — featuring a breathtaking amalgamation of rip-roaring combat, a star-making performance by Ansel Elgort, and a string of clever bits.","75","3890160"
"13862","The grey gathering gloom that hangs over Super Dark Times seeps into your bones.","75","5112578"
"13863","Fast on its feet, using 3D and motion-capture animation to kick its comedy-adventure into a superhuman gear, Steven Spielberg's The Adventures of Tintin is a wittily kineticized adaptation of the internationally loved comic books.","75","983193"
"13864","The film's special effects are astonishing, but the most notable and unexpected thing is its tone.","75","120201"
"13865","With its sketchy characters, slick production values, frequent backlighting, smart pacing and effective half-light, this Body Snatchers is good if not great scare stuff. It's almost too efficient, too technological-looking to generate the kind of primal fears it wants. Still, those pods are nothing to sneeze at. They remain one of insomnia's greatest hits. [25 Feb 1994, p.48]","75","106452"
"13866","I am recommending a movie that I do not seem to like very much. But part of the pleasure of moviegoing is pure spectacle -- of just sitting there and looking at great stuff and knowing it looks terrific. There wasn't much Schumacher could have done with the story or the music he was handed, but in the areas over which he held sway, he has triumphed.","75","293508"
"13867","What does not work, in a movie where almost everything, including dramatic rhetoric, has been kept on a modest scale up to this point, is the heavy-handed way Winterbottom (and Jolie) contrast the pain of loss with the pain of begetting toward the end.","75","829459"
"13868","Moviegoers will know in the first five minutes whether the new B-movie Machete is their cup of tea - or bucket of blood.","75","985694"
"13869","Reese Witherspoon can do a lot of things as an actor but playing a damaged-goods Depression era dame isn't one of them.","75","1067583"
"13870","The intelligence and unhackneyed humor of the believable, unself-conscious screenplay by fledgling director Mr. Zwick (son of veteran director Edward Zwick) deserves special praise. It never hits a false note.","75","2667918"
"13871","Just about everything connected to this movie is a tie-in, except for the popcorn. And even then I'm not too sure.","75","418279"
"13872","It may not be by-the-book history -- a relative term in any event, when discussing the ancients whose worldview embraced men, gods and monsters -- but what a spectacle!","75","416449"
"13873","By today's standards, THE JAZZ SINGER is mawkish, crudely filmed, and full of schmaltz. Yet it remains fascinating in its historical value, not only for its technical innovation, but because director Alan Crosland took his cameras on location into New York's Jewish ghetto around Hester and Orchard streets and then along the Great White Way of Broadway, showing the colorful, divergent, and now vanished ways of immigrant and show business life.","75","18037"
"13874","Though Babel lacks any tragic sense of inevitability, it almost compensates with a handful of vibrant performances and the palpable physical texture of the settings.","75","449467"
"13875","Never quite connects with us emotionally, yet the more it shades off into the gonzo-poetic, the more fun it becomes.","75","103074"
"13876","It's not everyone cup of bloody tea, but an unapologetic genre treat for those willing to dive in.","75","970452"
"13877","Us is something of a frustrating watch, a visual and technical marvel that just doesn’t seem to know what it is. Unlike Get Out, which only swelled in impact as you left the theater, Us is best viewed on a visceral level, not an intellectual one.","75","6857112"
"13878","Juno comes on all wisecracking and aren't-we-clever, but don't be surprised if you find yourself getting choked up -- with happy tears -- by the end.","75","467406"
"13879","Non-cultists should enjoy this engaging and well-acted retread -- a film that develops its own charm as it goes along.","75","155267"
"13880","Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior is a straightforward action/adventure film, filled to the brim with over-the-top chases and stunts.","75","82694"
"13881","It's an intimate psychological story laced with references to Hollywood movies.","75","67328"
"13882","It cheats a little, using a mix of amateurish extreme close-ups and striking Welsh industrial vistas to substitute for real technical proficiency, but also applies more formal consideration than most films, namely teen-centered comedies, ever do.","75","1440292"
"13883","The Brothers Bloom with satisfy those with a yearning for lighthearted heist tales, comedies, and offbeat romances.","75","844286"
"13884","There’s wit, rudeness, satire, lust and pathos, all effortlessly rolled up together. ""Skin Deep"" is sort of a filmmaker’s triathalon, and if Edwards doesn’t set any new records, he enters every event.","75","98343"
"13885","For certain movies, the adjectives ""formulaic"" and ""predictable"" are complimentary. War Horse is one of them.","75","1568911"
"13886","As an attempt to scale the craggy heights of a marriage in crisis, Downhill may be more bunny slope than black diamond — a force mineure, but still worth the trip.","75","4558376"
"13887","The film is less contemptuous of Brad than compassionate: brutally honest about his faults, yet ultimately understanding of them.","75","5884230"
"13888","Listen up, fanboys and enthusaiasts of sophisticated visual wizardry: this theological noir-horror actioner-a stand-alone, rapturous good time-craftily and accurately captures the straight-faced camp, wry wit and episodic structure of its source material.","75","360486"
"13889","Some viewers will decide that Benny & Joon strays too far from the brink; they will find its sentimentality cloying. Other viewers will applaud the classic silent film humour and will emerge with a glow they'll want to show off to their friends. Both camps can agree, however, that Mary Stuart Masterson, Aidan Quinn and Johnny Depp are quite good. [16 Apr 1993]","75","106387"
"13890","While Tamara Drew is enjoyable throughout-right up to its loony, loony ending-it's more than a little scattered.","75","1486190"
"13891","Credit goes to Richard Lester, who is much more than an action director and whose erratic brilliance occasionally transcends this material, and to Reeve, who has manfully refused to let on that he is tired of the part (as opposed to the Jedi principals, who phoned theirs in). [17 June 1983, p.D1]","75","86393"
"13892","Jenkins creates many remarkable scenes, particularly as the male characters discuss the racist realities with which they live.","75","7125860"
"13893","On the action-adventure level it's a sure-fire delight for fans, a punchy entertainment for average sci-fi buffs, and a colorful rocket-ride for moviegoers who just want a good time on Saturday night.","75","121766"
"13894","With a track record that stretches from ""Monster's Ball"" all the way to ""Finding Neverland,"" Forster is clearly a director at ease with a wide range of material. He's found confection-land here, setting his beater on ready-whip and mixing the dough just fine.","75","420223"
"13895","May not be as emotionally compelling as John Ford's work (""The Prisoner of Shark Island""), but it's every bit as meticulously crafted.","75","968264"
"13896","The film’s low-key approach to a tragic media scandal feels at once timely and old-fashioned — a character study from another era designed to comment on our own.","75","3513548"
"13897","The most coldly compelling version yet of the tale dreamed up by the late Stieg Larsson.","75","1568346"
"13898","Washington digs so deep under the skin of this complex character that we almost breath with him. It's a great, award-caliber performance in a movie that can barely contain it.","75","6000478"
"13899","It's not always an easy movie to watch, but its characters are unforgettable.","75","1399683"
"13900","There is absolutely nothing new in this variation on the time-honored creature-feature tropes. But the fun just builds and builds as our heroes and our Irish island come to a solution that seems — on the surface — awfully Irish in its logic.","75","1525366"
"13901","The ending is weak, and may be the result of the filmmakers writing themselves into a corner and not wanting to conclude things in a burst of nihilistic excess. Yet, even though it's a cheat, it retains a degree of resonance.","75","289879"
"13902","Alas, what you've heard about Sofia Coppola (as Michael's daughter) is true; she swallows words and speaks “valley girl.'' What a difference Winona Ryder would have made. [24 Dec 1990, Life, p.1D]","75","99674"
"13903","If only Taking Lives had given Jolie a greater foil than Ethan Hawke -- a young Kevin Spacey or Jack Nicholson say -- the film might have been a B-movie classic.","75","364045"
"13904","The Great Escape is great entertainment. [06 Jun 2004]","75","57115"
"13905","The Four Feathers ends on the same dubious note as ""Black Hawk Down"" and other recent war movies, suggesting that loyalty in the trenches -- not the reason for fighting in the first place -- is all that matters. Many will disagree.","75","240510"
"13906","The Lorax is a modest gem, failing to significantly enhance its source material's ideas but still delivering a zany, rollicking, multi-character version of Seuss's environmental cautionary tale.","75","1482459"
"13907","Some of the dialogue in Made was improvised, and the comic invention at work here -- Vaughn's and Favreau's -- make Made into a rough gem.","75","227005"
"13908","The Nice Guys delivers enough brilliant physical comedy to smooth over its blunter narrative devices.","75","3799694"
"13909","An authentic portrait with only a few false notes, Slash ought to be essential viewing for every awkward 15-year-old kid trying to figure themselves out.","75","4729990"
"13910","The film is chilled by characters that never really come alive or generate any deep sympathy.","75","1149362"
"13911","With the astonishingly assured newcomer Jason Schwartzman to bounce off of, Murray has his best comic foil since those feisty rodents in Groundhog Day and Caddyshack. [5 February 1999, Life, p.11E]","75","128445"
"13912","The movie that ""Mars Attacks!"" wanted to be, but wasn't. This is a snappy, clever, often-funny motion picture that provides the perfect blend of science fiction-style action with comic dialogue.","75","119654"
"13913","The film's crank-case snappishness doesn't break any molds, but it certainly gives you a lift.","75","147800"
"13914","Monsters, Inc. is cheerful, high-energy fun, and like the other Pixar movies, has a running supply of gags and references aimed at grownups.","75","198781"
"13915","If the film's love triangle feels a little silly and the arch-villains a little over the top, it's all secondary to del Toro's passionate immersion in Hellboy.","75","167190"
"13916","Flash Gordon is played for laughs, and wisely so. It is no more sophisticated than the comic strip it's based on, and that takes the curse off of material that was old before it was born. Is all of this ridiculous? Of course. Is it fun? Yeah, sort of, it is.","75","80745"
"13917","In the battle of the leading men, Crowe's character has a slight edge, and the actor really makes the most of it, showing us how boyishly mischievous charm and utter venality can exist without seeming contradiction in the same being. But Bale builds to a pretty impressive boil himself after laying back for about three quarters of the film.","75","381849"
"13918","It's hard to imagine Captain Phillips in the hands of any other filmmaker -- and Captain Phillips in the hands of Greengrass looks exactly like anyone familiar with his work would expect. It does justice to the material even while playing too conscientiously by the book.","75","1535109"
"13919","The actors in The A-Team are all excellent, and they save a movie that routinely defies logic and physics Liam Neeson brings credibility and gravitas to any role he plays, but as ""Hannibal"" Smith, he swaggers like a paternal Han Solo.","75","429493"
"13920","An outstanding effort that maintains the integrity and purpose that distinguished ""The Fellowship of the Ring.""","75","167261"
"13921","Director Gus Van Sant finds the human side of a knotty issue. No polemics. Just the face of a new America in crisis.","75","2091473"
"13922","The only character with any personality in The Grudge is a Tokyo house, but not to worry - it's got enough mean in it to keep any horror movie afloat.","75","391198"
"13923","The premise is ordinary, but the film is distinguished by funny gags and excellent performances by Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall.","75","88128"
"13924","Four Lions is impossible to categorize. It's an exceedingly dark comedy, a wicked satire, a thriller where the thrills center on the incompetence of the villains.","75","1341167"
"13925","This version of Where the Wilds Things Are isn’t about childhood at all but about childhood’s end and what’s gained and lost by it. That’s why very young kids, dull Disney princesses, overprotective parents, and self-serious grown-ups should probably stay away.","75","386117"
"13926","Don't be misled by the chopsticks and cherry blossoms: Memoirs of a Geisha, for all its exotic casting and locale, is our friend ""Cinderella"" in a kimono.","75","397535"
"13927","Visually impressive, splendidly performed, thematically significant, this is a movie in full possession of every key cinematic asset except one -- a solid script. Casino is a polished vehicle with an untuned engine.","75","112641"
"13928","It's possible to filter out the irritating aspects and enjoy the movie as a raucous, often brilliantly assembled spectacle. But we shouldn't have to. The fact that we do makes an otherwise hugely impressive sequel feel small-minded.","75","369610"
"13929","Fans will probably spend little time debating Star Trek's intellectual depths; there are none. But the human element triumphs over the technological in a resolution that is sentimental and highly satisfying. Star Trek is a visually boggling 23rd-Century fantasy. But peel away the budget and it's as comforting as an old-fashioned fable. [8 Dec. 1979]","75","79945"
"13930","The film's heart is in the right place, and Ferris Bueller is slight, whimsical and sweet.","75","91042"
"13931","To Stewart and screenwriter Cory Goodman's credit, the whole set up takes about 10 minutes flat, leaving Priest's remaining 77 minutes to the dark, desolate action at hand. Even more to their credit, there's something evocative in that darkness, something poetic in its desolation.","75","822847"
"13932","A dynamic story, sprinkled with some interesting ideas about the preciousness of culture and how societies might rebuild themselves.","75","1037705"
"13933","As enjoyable as most of Unforgiven is, Eastwood's shades-of-gray moralism feels like a whitewash.","75","105695"
"13934","These extremely attractive characters deserve a better finish. [8 May 1987, p.7-D]","75","93409"
"13935","For a little while The Client seems as though it's going to be a battle of wits between the two lawyers played by Sarandon and Jones. The interplay between the two is the best thing about the movie. [20 July 1994, p.E1]","75","109446"
"13936","It is pitch-perfect, telling the story through the enthusiastic and single-minded vision of its hero Ralphie, and finding in young Peter Billingsley a sly combination of innocence and calculation.","75","85334"
"13937","At the same time that Boorman seduces us with such enchantments, he also deceives us with a crafty little googly of his own--persuading us that he is embarking on a fresh adventure while aiming straight for the heart of old-fashioned English cinema.","75","93209"
"13938","Penny Marshall brings a logic to the premise that is sustained through most of the movie. And where the other movies snickered at the sexual possibilities in the idea, she faces up to them with both candor and taste.","75","94737"
"13939","The movie suffers from backstory-heavy voiceover narration in its first half, followed by an excess of quirky laugh lines down the stretch, just when it seems to be finding a stronger rhythm. There's a shameless crowd-pleasing element to The Descendants that keeps its harder truths about family relationships at bay.","75","1033575"
"13940","Julia Roberts has never played a dowager before, but heaven knows she makes a good, and funny, one.","75","472062"
"13941","The sheer outrageousness of its attitude is enough to make Heathers a very welcome relief in a field dominated by sanctimonious and second-hand virtue. [31 March 1989]","75","97493"
"13942","Succeeds as a satirical fantasy about writerly self-involvement, but it's worth celebrating as a testament to self-made greatness, particularly in regard to the efforts of writer/star Zoe Kazan.","75","1839492"
"13943","This high-quality Disney animation combines strong pictorial appeal with amiable voice-performances.","75","120762"
"13944","An enticingly risque saga of the 16th century monarch.","75","414055"
"13945","The actress may get an Oscar nomination for the wrong movie -- ""Moulin Rouge"" over ""The Others"" -- but it would be a double misfortune for audiences to overlook a performance that boosts its movie from moderate to memorable.","75","188453"
"13946","Rarely has a movie captured the obscene violence of sex trafficking with such unvarnished grubbiness. In the end, though, The Whistleblower is a corporate thriller.","75","896872"
"13947","Though not as memorable as the series on which it is based, it does the job as big-screen entertainment.","75","106977"
"13948","With Steven Soderbergh at the helm, this has become a whimsical, semi-comedic romp, complete with a score by Marvin Hamlisch that recalls kitschy '70s TV shows, cutesy captions, and a tongue-and-cheek approach to the entire story.","75","1130080"
"13949","The movie is more about how many things Michael Bay can smash up -- lots. That might not be a talent most people respect, but it gets through to people anyway, and here Bay does it exceptionally well.","75","399201"
"13950","At times more in line with ""Blazing Saddles"" than the grimly bawdy qualities that define many bonafide oaters, Django Unchained erupts with a conceptual brilliance from the outset that never fully meshes with its clumsy storyline. Nevertheless, it's a giddy ride.","75","1853728"
"13951","Like a lava lamp turned on high, Joe Versus the Volcano glows with originality. Go bask in it. [9 Mar 1990, p.4D]","75","99892"
"13952","Sally Hawkins is just plain irresistible in this funny, touching and vital salute to women in the work force.","75","1371155"
"13953","Krasinski appears to know exactly the kind of movie he’s making, elevating familiar material to a level that feels real and bittersweet.","75","3714720"
"13954","It's got thrills and chills and one of the most elegantly conceived monsters in the history of movies.","75","93773"
"13955","In the end (and it's a happy end, to be sure), Catch Me if You Can is as crisp and trim as a new suit. Well, a new old suit - say, circa the 1960s.","75","264464"
"13956","Hold on for a hell of a ride.","75","463854"
"13957","Gaghan is attempting to cover so much ground in Syriana that the movie at times feels a little suffocating.","75","365737"
"13958","It's a powerful argument for optimism.","75","1045670"
"13959","Woo, who is known and appreciated for his unique stylistic approach to violence and bloodshed, creates a kinetic ballet of bullets and explosions that drives the adrenaline level through the roof.","75","119094"
"13960","It's the rare film to sell sex as something truly tender and life-affirming, and Helen Hunt, in particular, is lovely and poignant.","75","1866249"
"13961","But Van Sant, whose vision is otherwise sharp, pushes the connection to Shakespeare's Henry IV too far, having Reeves at one point declaim in rhyming couplets, which severely tests even the most forgiving viewer.","75","102494"
"13962","Exploitation pure and simple. But it's artistically redeeming exploitation. If you can handle it, see it.","75","1242432"
"13963","There's much mumbo-jumbo about past lives and symbolic tattoos, but who cares when you can gaze at a sight as lovely as a dirigible floating in the night sky?","75","209163"
"13964","Den of Thieves delivers an above-average cops-and-robbers heist film.","75","1259528"
"13965","A pointed simplicity governs Michael Dudok de Wit's The Red Turtle, one that’s traditional of many survival tales.","75","3666024"
"13966","What Abrams has done is strip Star Wars down to its core components, rearranging the stuff people liked about the original trilogy and getting rid of what they hated about the rest.","75","2488496"
"13967","Wan in particular is pacing today's movie horror by reverting to the past. There's a touch of Hammer Films in his haunted house atmospheres, and Roger Corman in his groaning comic relief from the dread.","75","2226417"
"13968","Well, the movie suffers slightly from that tendency -- the portrait shows definite signs of airbrushing. But it's rendered with enough intelligence, and performed with sufficient grace, to offer us an occasionally compelling, curiously upbeat look behind the lacquered image and into the complicated self.","75","115632"
"13969","It's a gritty, almost ugly to look at film, and Cianfrance isn't shy about including a random blast of unwarranted shaky footage.","75","1120985"
"13970","The Guard is John Michael McDonagh's caustically funny riff on cop and crime films.","75","1540133"
"13971","Gary Oldman’s portrayal of Churchill is among the best to reach the screen. With the help of makeup, Oldman immerses himself so deeply in the role that the actor disappears.","75","4555426"
"13972","Manages to overcome its flaws and become a charming love letter to love itself -- and a pitch-perfect V-Day date film to boot.","75","817230"
"13973","If the film covers well-tread territory (a morally bankrupt player trying to prolong his own influence), it does so with pinpoint control of mood and theme.","75","1764183"
"13974","Fresh and often very funny, and it makes its point that when our native urges conflict with social norms, the former shall give in to the latter, or else.","75","219822"
"13975","Make no mistake: This isn't a relentless button-pushing joke machine like the best Apatow schlumpy-man comedies. I guess I'd describe it as ""agreeably ribald.""","75","800039"
"13976","Wes Ball's background is in animation and effects, and he certainly has an eye for composition. Thankfully, he doesn't just lean on visual flash in his debut feature, the adaptation of the first of James Dashner's four books, and his skills allow him to build a convincing world around his appealing cast without losing them in it completely.","75","1790864"
"13977","It's Mamet in a lighthearted mood, playing with dialogue, repeating phrases just because he likes them, and supplying us with a closing line that achieves, I think, a kind of greatness.","75","120202"
"13978","It's killer, dude! [17 October 1997, p. 52]","75","119345"
"13979","It’s a gorgeous, romantic drama that earns its emotional resonance without venturing beyond the most familiar beats.","75","5716464"
"13980","Susan Sarandon and Barry Bostwick are perfectly caste as two naivewaifs who stumble upon the castle of Dr. Frank-N-Furter after car troubleon a rainy night. The supporting cast is appropriately, well, let's sayidiosyncratic, but for my money it's Tim Curry as the mad doctor whosteals the show. Surely he stands as the most charismatic transsexualTransylvanian ever. [1 Dec 1990]","75","73629"
"13981","Filled with nasty, nasty stuff.","75","829482"
"13982","I won't tell you Taken is great, but it's great fun.","75","936501"
"13983","The best Star Trek stories are allegorical - in addition to telling an involving story, they're about something other than going into space and blowing up enemy ships. Insurrection continues that tradition.","75","120844"
"13984","It isn't gangsta, but it's winning all the same.","75","422774"
"13985","A fun afternoon for preteen moviegoers that has just enough charm, humor and game- for-anything actors to keep parents halfway interested as well.","75","167456"
"13986","At times Ender’s Game throws so many metaphors and moral dilemmas our way, we almost forget to appreciate the stunning and gorgeous visuals covering every inch of the screen. Almost.","75","1731141"
"13987","The best thing about Beginners is the way it accepts every character in a nonjudgmental way.","75","1532503"
"13988","J. Edgar shines a probing beam of light on a man who was widely feared, often disliked, but rarely understood.","75","1616195"
"13989","De Niro is so good at playing a man who has essentially emasculated himself because of fear of his anger, so that sex and anger may be leashed in precisely the opposite way, as in ""Raging Bull."" And Norton, the puppetmaster - it may not even be freedom he requires, but simply the pleasure of controlling others to obtain it.","75","1423995"
"13990","Never soars, but it never flags. It remains brisk, engaging and pleasant throughout, and face it: If a movie this well made had Spanish or French subtitles, we'd all be talking about it as a searing examination of sexual politics.","75","1001508"
"13991","The Craft casts a spell with a cast of four kicky young actresses, atmospheric California settings, cool special effects and the attitude of a music video. [03 May 1996]","75","115963"
"13992","Megamind is an amusing family entertainment and gains some energy from clever dialogue and the fun Will Ferrell has with his character.","75","1001526"
"13993","Erratic, unpredictable and constantly intriguing, Miles Ahead plays more like one of Davis' compositions than a traditional biopic, stumbling around with flashes of insight and a brilliant central performance.","75","790770"
"13994","Big, loud, glossy and entertaining.","75","417217"
"13995","A gracefully subtle metaphor about life's Deep Magic has become a war film; what was a one-chapter battle toward the end of the book is now a ripsnorting Armageddon that looks like something Hieronymus Bosch might dream up after a heavy meal.","75","363771"
"13996","I would not have missed seeing this film, and I recommend it for its richness of imagery. But at 127 minutes, which seems a reasonable length, it plays long.","75","119116"
"13997","At it’s best, Tusk is outlandishly unforgettable.","75","3099498"
"13998","Abrams knits together the ordinary stories of the mill town's inhabitants in a way that feels dramatic without showing their contrivances too obviously. And his casting of Courtney and Fanning was fortuitous, though Abrams' banter for the supporting kids grows tiresome in that ""Goonies"" way.","75","1650062"
"13999","Lavishly produced animation makes imaginative use of familiar formulas, filling the screen with handsome images accompanied by sprightly songs and lively voice-performances.","75","118617"
"14000","This is a crude, shapeless talkie, a technically unsophisticated film in which the sound is static and the camera immobile, with the comedians leaping into the set scenes. Yet the boys are there in all their frenetic glory.","75","19777"
"14001","Even if it doesn't quite stick the landing, there's a lot to like here; it's a fundamentally decent, very well-acted and cannily written film.","75","2140373"
"14002","Has the sort of richness and dimension that are the hallmarks of master storytellers at work.","75","382932"
"14003","Holy moly, Melissa Leo makes a scary Mother Superior.","75","4513316"
"14004","Even without handicapping for the limitations of its gentle genre, the film has moments of whimsical humor and thoughtful plotting that soar tantalizingly close to something that could be enjoyed on its own merits.","75","327137"
"14005","Michel B. Jordan plays Erik Killmonger with such moving, occasionally gut-wrenching commitment that it nearly mitigates the goofiness of his moniker and the superficiality of the film in toto.","75","1825683"
"14006","There is something uniquely unforgettable in the way Linklater, Hawke and Delpy (equal collaborators on the script) find nuance, art and eroticism in words, spoken and unspoken. The actors shine.","75","381681"

"14008","A film where suspense and exhilaration are incompatible, and a receding plot line is merely the platform for cars to fly through panes of glass.","75","187078"

"14013","Heading toward his destination as a decent man facing ruin by doing the right thing, Mr. Hardy does a great job acting out the phases of anxiety frustration, confusion, exasperation and ultimate resolve — while working overtime to save a movie that takes place entirely on a cell phone from getting boring.","75","2692904"

"14020","The cascade of ideas proves to be both pleasurable and frustrating. As the movie retreats into a happy-ever-after ending, even its outrageous lies seem more like little white ones.","75","1058017"
"14021","A funny, naughty, enormously entertaining kick in the pants, promising to be an East Coast “Showgirls,” only to wind up a girls-rule “Goodfellas,” leading viewers into a vicariously thrilling underworld ruled by money, drugs, seduction and a sliding moral scale dictated by ruthless realpolitik.","75","5503686"

"14023","Avengers: Endgame has almost nothing on its mind but crossing the Ts and dotting the Is of a far-flung superhero saga, but to anyone with even a minor emotional stake in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it has all the fleeting satisfaction of a shot of whipped cream delivered directly from the spray can.","75","4154796"
"14024","So extreme is his mad dog behavior, indeed, that it shades over into humor: Washington seems to enjoy a performance that's over the top and down the other side.","75","139654"
"14025","Nine to Five is a good-hearted, simple-minded comedy that will win a place in film history, I suspect, primarily because it contains the movie debut of Dolly Parton. She is, on the basis of this one film, a natural-born movie star, a performer who holds our attention so easily that it's hard to believe it's her first film.","75","80319"
"14026","It's quite a lot of fun.","75","177789"
"14027","Coppola presents a smart cross-examination of the impact of media exposure on fickle young minds. While the ambitions of its young thieves often blur together and lack precise definition, The Bling Ring is the director's breeziest work, allowing the story to glide along with the ease of a heist movie.","75","2132285"

"14044","A silly, high-spirited chase picture that takes us, as they say, from the canyons of Manhattan to the steaming jungles of South America. After all the Raiders rip-offs, it's fun to find an adventure film that deserves the comparison, that has the same spirit and sense of humor.","75","88011"
"14045","Eragon may not be a big Oscar contender, but in a movie season filled with blood diamonds, fascist soldiers and Idi Amin, it provides a much-needed afternoon of PG-rated family-friendly adventure.","75","449010"

"14051","What with the film's cotton-candy mise en the scene, rhyming goblins (“Mortal world turned to ice/Here be goblin paradise”), sexless pixies and elementary light/dark metaphors that reference the order of its universe, Legend is a gothic fairy tale brought to life.","75","89469"

"14054","Overall, it's an enjoyable film, thankfully free of the computerized look of later Disney cartoons, but it really can't compare to the real Disney classics (which appealed equally to both kids and adults).","75","97757"
"14055","Brutally intense and elegantly crafted, the film showcases the stellar acting chops of Andrew Garfield and Vince Vaughn, and it’s director Mel Gibson’s best work behind the scenes since 1995’s Oscar best-picture winner Braveheart.","75","2119532"
"14056","Another example of concept over coherence, but the entertainment value is considerable.","75","2180411"
"14057","I don't much care if the battles aren't that amazing, because the story doesn't depend on them. It's about a sacrifice made by Spock, and it draws on the sentiment and audience identification developed over the years by the TV series.","75","84726"
"14058","The brothers' dark, all-star farce about sex, lies and surveillance is pretty damned funny.","75","887883"

"14060","When you sit down to The Shining, you sit down with normal expectations of being diverted, perhaps even being gripped, but not being undermined. But the film undermines you in powerful, inchoate ways. It's a horror story even for people who don't like horror stories - maybe especially for them. [14 Jun 1980, p.1]","75","81505"
"14061","Unlike the director’s debut feature The Cabin In The Woods, Bad Times At The El Royale isn’t a deconstruction of the neo-noir genre so much as a structurally ambitious example of same.","75","6628394"
"14062","Given the complexity of attitudes and the ambiguous take on the family represented in such Spielberg films as “E.T.'' and “Poltergeist,'' the bland affirmations of Jurassic Park seem platitudinous and insincere. He's forcing it here, and it shows. [11 June 1993, Friday, p.A]","75","107290"
"14063","The delight of the movie is Keitel, who finally gets to play someone who doesn't look like he's about to mug you.","75","114478"
"14064","Gerwig is trying for something a little different, juggling the time frame and creating a “meta” ending to make the story’s feminist themes overt and incorporate an ambiguous “twist” that some will see as clever and others may find heretical.","75","3281548"
"14065","Moving the action to a modern American city, the hyperactive movie seems goofy and gimmicky at first, but it acquires real power when the cinematography settles down enough for Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes to do some excellent acting.","75","117509"
"14066","It's mostly a disturbingly believable portrait of a psychopath whose true depths of rage are buried where none but he can see. The ironically named Plainview does not come into plain view until the last scene, and the lupine, scowling Day-Lewis is mesmerizing in the role.","75","469494"
"14067","One dazzling (if overlong) bridge: technologically advanced, brilliantly designed, spectacularly executed, solid as steel in its unspectacular elements. But unlike its 1999 predecessor, this is a movie that nobody but avid video gamers and motorcyclists needs to see more than once.","75","234215"
"14068","There is much cleverness and ingenuity in Payback, but Mel Gibson is the key. The movie wouldn't work with an actor who was heavy on his feet, or was too sincere about the material.","75","120784"
"14069","Fatal Attraction becomes as seductive as the seduction it depicts. In the always stylish, sometimes careless hands of director Adrian Lyne, the film lures us in with an artful blend of stately pacing and caressing close-ups and brooding silences. [23 Sep 1987 p.C7]","75","93010"
"14070","A beautifully shot, well-acted movie that manages to make a complicated, real-life story without much drama feel like a thriller.","75","140352"
"14071","It’s a perfectly unexceptional but slickly made, sincerely acted, often entertaining, sometimes manipulative and always watchable blend of action on the diamond and bravery behind the scenes that will please baseball fanatics more than movie historians. It’s a good enough biopic to make you wish it were a better motion picture.","75","453562"
"14072","May be one of the most fun-free, angst-ridden teens we've seen on the big screen in a long time.","75","1259571"
"14073","More explosive laughs from Leslie Nielsen, Pricilla Presley, and friends (George Kennedy, O.J. Simpson) in another madcap police farce that is often so funny you lose track of the terrorist story. Alas, the comic pace is not sustained to the finish, but maybe it couldn't be. [18 Mar 1994, p.C]","75","110622"
"14074","It contains one element of startling originality: its bad guy, nicknamed Pooh-Bear and played by Vincent D'Onofrio in a great weird demented giggle of a performance; imagine a Batman villain cycled through the hallucinations of ""Requiem for a Dream.""","75","235737"
"14075","There's a degree of gruff integrity at work for at least two-thirds of Alexandre Aja's grindhouse piranhapalooza Piranha 3D, in which a megaschool of man-eating fish thought to be extinct burst through an underwater fissure to terrorize a normally placid lake in Arizona.","75","464154"
"14076","That Body Bags largely succeeds, despite the perceptible lack of novel material, can be attributed to the strength of the assembled performances as well as the filmmakers’ attention to the dynamics of visual storytelling.","75","106449"
"14077","It is a real film. Not a slick exploitation exercise with all the trappings of depravity but none of the consequences.","75","134273"
"14078","Jolie keeps the narrative afloat thanks to first-rate craftsmanship, a few well-honed moments of bonafide suspense, and a terrifically restrained Jack O'Connell in the lead role. While it only hints at the sweeping epic that never fully materializes, Unbroken offers further proof that Jolie's directorial instincts pass muster alongside her other talents.","75","1809398"
"14079","Even more than its predecessors in the ""Star Wars"" series, Return of the Jedi is about incredible special effects and astonishingly effective costumes and makeup. The characters and dialogue get lost somewhere between the bug-eyed monsters and the exploding spaceships, but it is all so much fun it probably really does not matter a whole lot.","75","86190"
"14080","The jokes that are there are shocking and hysterical, and unlike some similar comedies about grownup friends, the four core characters are actually likeable.","75","3564472"
"14081","Dispenses with much of the caramel gooeyness of the first two episodes in favor of decent action, some heartfelt tender moments and even a splash of wit. This time they’re actually Twi-ing.","75","1325004"
"14082","It's been a while since we've had a good monster movie, and while Cloverfield probably won't give you sleepless nights, it will certainly keep you awake in the theater.","75","1060277"
"14083","The Killing Of A Sacred Deer doesn’t have as sharp an allegorical edge as his best work — it’s no Dogtooth in that respect — but it does find the director honing his command of unnerving atmosphere to a razor point, enhanced by a camera that glides menacingly down hospital corridors and gazes from above with the severity of a merciless god.","75","5715874"
"14084","The news about this movie is that it makes it clear that both Timberlake and Kunis are the real thing when it comes to light comedy.","75","1632708"
"14085","A collection of arbitrary sketches, bits and improvs jammed into a locker room-style variety show masquerading as some semblance of a narrative.","75","145660"
"14086","A detail-oriented thriller that lets us keep up even as it races to a conclusion.","75","1458175"
"14087","The movie contains elements that make it very good, and a lot of other elements besides. Less is more.","75","119643"
"14088","One of the chief pleasures of My Week with Marilyn - which should not be approached as anything other than fluffy entertainment - is watching Williams bring to life Monroe's inner demons and her movie-star allure with equal aplomb. By the time the film's book-ending closing musical number comes around (That Old Black Magic), the illusion is astounding and complete.","75","1655420"
"14089","Essentially a love story, as stripped of sentimentality as the landscape is shorn of green, yet an extraordinary love story nonetheless – powerful and poignant and, even in the midst of hope's imminent extinction, hopeful too.","75","898367"
"14090","Cross Ingmar Bergman's Persona with Roman Polanski's oeuvre and you get a workable mix ultimately sunk by standard slasher silliness. [14 Aug 1992, p.4D]","75","105414"
"14091","Robert Eggers loosens the noose of veracity that choked his meticulously researched but painfully self-serious debut just enough to allow for so much absurdism to peek through.","75","7984734"
"14092","The Man from U.N.C.L.E. plays a like a lower key, vintage edition of a “Mission: Impossible” movie. It’s a good movie with a great look.","75","1638355"
"14093","It's simply an opportunity to spend time with characters who may lack depth but are fun to watch.","75","1583420"
"14094","Ultimately, the film can't help but disappoint. Movies where you're continually waiting for the other shoe to drop are never as much fun as those where you never expected the first one to fall.","75","217869"
"14095","Broken Embraces is stylish and sly, an engaging exercise that gives us less than meets the eye.","75","913425"
"14096","Through its first two-thirds it is as perfect a myth of adolescence as any of the Disney films, documenting the childlike, nameless heroine's initiation into the adult mysteries of sex, death, and identity, and the impossibility of reconciling these forces with family strictures.","75","32976"
"14097","Me and Earl and the Dying Girl treats a serious subject with wackadoodle humor that is endearingly contagious. It’s tender, clever, wise and highly recommended.","75","2582496"
"14098","Viewers engulfed by the movie's intense romance and spectacular action could leave the theater exhausted. But it's a good ride: The Last of the Mohicans creates its own vibrant world, hurling audiences into it and allowing no relief from the excitement until the end. [25 Sep 1992, p.13]","75","104691"
"14099","Machine Gun Preacher is stirring when it presents Childers as a hero, but it does its most impressive work when it addresses him as a flawed, struggling, but still determined man.","75","1586752"
"14100","The results are generally refreshing. Much of the film takes place inside a theatre, as if to suggest the shenanigans of the Saint Petersburg aristocracy were a form of public entertainment.","75","1781769"
"14101","Here is an excellent crime thriller made with grown-ups in mind: Yep, it must definitely be fall.","75","765443"
"14102","Mainly, it's a clever gimmick, cleverly wrought, offering further evidence that you can dress up the student body in all manner of garb for all types of genres.","75","393109"
"14103","As engrossing as The Young Victoria is, this isn't a movie that will stay with you very long. Mostly that's because Blunt's character does little by way of evolving.","75","962736"
"14104","Jolie does not dwell on the atrocities, though a horrifyingly ironic battle scene near the end contains some gruesome imagery.","75","4882376"
"14105","In this journey, [Crowe] wears the uniform, the accent and the derring-do with consummate panache. Have him strike a muscular pose on the ship's prow, which Weir does more than once, and the manly sight puts that wussy DiCaprio to titanic shame.","75","311113"
"14106","Those who deplore Beavis and Butt-Head are confusing the messengers with the message.","75","115641"
"14107","Dry humor keeps In Bruges fresh and lively and makes it a whole lot of fun to watch.","75","780536"
"14108","The sweetest little movie about a neurological disorder that we're ever likely to see.","75","132512"
"14109","Julia Roberts is brighter and spunkier than usual, and Rupert Everett steals the show.","75","119738"
"14110","The glee that director James Wan clearly has playing in the world of Aquaman is infectious. He’s made a movie for both types of 10-year-olds: literal kids and those who are 10 at heart. Aquaman is one hell of a popcorn movie.","75","1477834"
"14111","With “Free Fire,” Wheatley wants to push his own limits of onscreen mayhem, taking things right to the line where most directors would pull back, and pushing everything right over. And what the director winds up doing is making a big, magnificent noise, one that will certainly see more than his core fanbase sitting up and paying attention.","75","4158096"
"14112","Delivers pretty much exactly what its audience wants and expects: big, dumb, campy fun so deliriously, comically macho, it's remarkable that no one in the cast died of testosterone poisoning.","75","1320253"
"14113","If you are a thoughtful, open-minded person see this reverent exploration into the mystery of Jesus, the man.","75","95497"
"14114","The heart and mind of Maudie are always in the right place.","75","3721954"
"14115","Wind River may not blow you away, but this bitter, visceral, and almost parodically intense thriller knows what it takes to survive.","75","5362988"
"14116","As always, Wiseman’s approach guarantees memorable encounters.","75","12094720"
"14117","The Descent is bloody, disturbing, and genuinely frightening--you'll be very happy to leave that dark theater.","75","435625"
"14118","There may be no honor among thieves, but Triple Frontier certainly makes watching them pretty entertaining.","75","1488606"
"14119","Moneyball comes to life when elaborating on Beane's unique system of player selection, and the on-field baseball action is at times electrifying, but it trends toward the generic when tailing him away from the stadium.","75","1210166"
"14120","What this movie is about, and where it succeeds best, is the primordial level of fear. The characters, for the most part, and the non-fish elements in the story, are comparatively weak and not believable. [20 June 1975]","75","73195"
"14121","A Tom Cruise action flick with a strong female heroine and a sense of humor? Edge of Tomorrow has both of those, plus a “Groundhog Day’’-style gimmick that pays big dividends. Over and over.","75","1631867"
"14122","A refreshingly unpredictable and fizzy comic fantasy. It tickles the fancy even when it strains credibility.","75","1234548"
"14123","Throw in the music -- a wall-to-wall whorl of Eastern modal dirges, thumping rock and Celtic-y skirl -- and you've got a veritable cinematic rhapsody of war.","75","265086"
"14124","This movie hangs utterly on performance, and DiCaprio’s Gatsby is mesmerizing.","75","1343092"
"14125","No other artform could quite present such a collision of time, place, idea and emotion, and it’s clear that Nolan’s pure intent is to give us the utmost of what this medium can uniquely provide. At its best this is a ride that manages to be viscerally thrilling while still being emotionally and intellectually engaging, all in ways that are truly, uniquely cinematic. In other words, say what you will about the tenets of Tenet, at least it has an ethos.","75","6723592"
"14126","Duncan Jones, director of the very fine and very paranoid ""Moon,"" makes this seemingly silly situation work, building tension over 93 minutes.","75","945513"
"14127","It's a smart, bold genre exercise that's enormous fun to watch, harking back to gritty urban thrillers of the 1970s with an assured sense of tone and style.","75","840361"
"14128","Hail, Caesar! is immensely entertaining, but it's also frustratingly discursive, with so many incomplete sidelines and distractions that it suggests an overcrowded but exciting TV pilot more than a self-contained film.","76","475290"
"14129","I don’t know how he does it, or for that matter why, but Spielberg turns Ready Player One into something that’s both nostalgic and new, something impersonal yet uniquely his. It is not one of his better movies; it’s probably not even in the top half. It’s way too long and packed with too much extra junk. It is still, somehow, a gas.","76","1677720"
"14130","Ruben Brandt, Collector is a wonderful heist film, a thrilling action-adventure, a gorgeous visual feast, and an intriguing look at an artist whose greatest talent is recognizing the value of the art inside others.","76","6241872"
"14131","In an exhausted, introspective, dad-jokey way, Bad Boys for Life gives these boys a definitive ending. It isn’t one fans ever expected, but it’s highly watchable.","76","1502397"
"14132","Yes, it’s a wrestling movie, but Fighting With My Family is also a delightful entry into a genre that has too few inspiring stories for young girls. It’s a warm-hearted underdog saga with a feminist undertone and a celebration of everyone’s inner misfit.","76","6513120"
"14133","Even with the film’s mild flaws and arms-wide-open approach, it tells a powerful, engaging and compelling story of how America challenged and changed five young black men, and how they in turn challenged and changed America.","76","1398426"
"14134","This isn’t a glorious rebirth, it’s a functional facsimile, and it’s a wholly satisfying piece of slasher entertainment regardless.","76","1502407"
"14135","The year's first sure-fire Oscar nominee has arrived with flying colors.","77","166943"
"14136","Crawl is a fun albeit familiar human vs. beast movie, one that gets plenty of mileage out of its setting and people’s deep-set fear of being eaten.","77","8364368"
"14137","A Quiet Place is an extremely compelling experience—but it could have been greater still.","77","6644200"
"14138","Molly’s Game doesn’t announce Aaron Sorkin as the next great filmmaker, but he’s a good one. It’s a competently filmed production with some fine performances, but it lacks the focus and showpersonship that would be necessary to make it feel like more.","77","4209788"
"14139","Jason Reitman’s adaptation of Joyce Maynard’s Labor Day is as consistently assured a piece of filmmaking as any we’ve seen from the filmmaker and very much in keeping with the decreasingly glib nature of his output.","77","1967545"
"14140","With a narrative that adheres to such universal themes, Merchant reaches beyond the film’s wrestling fan core audience and constructs an inspiring story everyone can enjoy.","77","6513120"
"14141","It’s got grit and power, not to mention great fake-band songs by Alicia Bognanno and Anika Pyle. And as a movie about learning to balance youthful creativity and adult responsibilities, it’s leagues better than what Disney did to Perry’s “Christopher Robin” script. Put this one on your playlist.","77","7942742"
"14142","A goofy, kitschy- but- fun romp and the most purely entertaining of the three Thor movies, marked by its distinctive designs, ‘80s synth score, and assemblage of spirited characters. It’s carried by the excellent chemistry between Thor, Hulk, and Valkyrie, who give humanity to a visual effects-heavy spectacle that finally makes good on Thor’s title of God of Thunder.","77","3501632"
"14143","While the characters are distinctive and charming, and the dialogue is often pretty funny, The Nice Guys is a large step down on the ambition scale from Kiss Kiss. Having deconstructed his favorite genre so perfectly, Black has a harder time reconstructing it without leaving out some pieces.","77","3799694"
"14144","It’s a beautiful thing, Wright’s film, an act of historical tension made with the grandest of ambitions tempered by the most careful of portrayals—precise in its bloat and fearless in its fantasy—a reminder today of what makes for actual leadership in a world exhausted by flummoxed white men with sound and fury, signifying nothing.","77","4555426"
"14145","Ultimately, the strengths of Unbroken far outweigh its flaws.","77","1809398"
"14146","Old-school ""Gosh, wow!"" sense-of-wonder filmmaking is in short supply in these anxious days, and John Carter (of Mars!) left me with my disbelief in suspended animation and once or twice with goosebumps dotting my arms. And that's enough for me.","78","401729"
"14147","When Eastwood is at the top of his form -- as he is for much of this film -- there's no more spellbinding storyteller in American cinema.","78","139668"
"14148","With centrifugal force on his side, Spider-Man dips, weaves, and whooshes past, up, and around the camera -- it's a rush, and it plasters a grin on your face even after you've left the theatre.","78","145487"
"14149","Writer/director Lonergan succeeds at capturing eloquently the disappointments of growing up and growing old. But he isn't always successful at reining in the schmaltz.","78","203230"
"14150","Eastwood keeps his direction lean and mean. There’s not an ounce of wasted screen time in Sully’s 96 minutes, but the story, an example of “truth is stranger than fiction,” has all the thrust it needs, and then some.","78","3263904"
"14151","Charmingly subversive animation like this is a rare thing indeed, and the fact that you don't have to be under 10 years of age to thoroughly enjoy Mr. Shrek's wild ride is an added bonus.","78","126029"
"14152","It's Stiller's knowledgeable use of these smaller touches that (along with the excellent cast -- it's great to see Winona relinquishing period gowns and back where she can do some real damage) pushes the film along a solid, fresh line and toward its admittedly Hollywood conclusion. Stiller and company imbue their film with an honest, sarcastic wit that's all too familiar: apparently, somebody's been filming our lives. Does this mean we'll all be getting royalties?","78","110950"
"14153","At times it feels almost too busy with plotting. There's so much going on, and so much to take in, that it leaves you winded. But that's origin stories for you. No one ever said setting up a savior would be simple.","78","372784"
"14154","Although it is achingly sad, Rabbit Hole is not maudlin or depressing.","78","935075"
"14155","Hopper, unsurprisingly, devours scenery like he's already dead and loving it, but for once his penchant for overacting is overshadowed by the real stars of Romero's world: They're dead, they're all messed up, but it's great to finally have them back in town.","78","418819"
"14156","Works best when it works its mournful magic alone, without fanfare, using only the flickering fear in Cole's gaze as it meets the compassion in Crowe's.","78","167404"
"14157","The film's politically correct repudiation of the familiar black-and-white characterizations of the white and red man is ultimately undermined, however, when the pendulum swings too far in the other direction.","78","99348"
"14158","Balibar and Depardieu make a compelling duo who exude an animal magnetism that's undeniable.","78","781435"
"14159","As all his films have shown, Cuarón is clearly one of the most original filmmakers working today, and Children of Men should solidify his place at the top of those ranks. With a great script, there should be no stopping him.","78","206634"
"14160","Frankly, I'm shocked that Disney, frequent purveyor of sleeping beauties and singing animated animals, is the studio behind this wonderfully black comedy/morality tale for children, but maybe Disney, too, saw past the material's deliciously macabre bent to find also a thrilling little essay on friendship, fate, and the restorative powers of onions.","78","311289"
"14161","The middle is terrific, especially in a lengthy, unassuming scene in which the three leads sit, sip drinks, and have a good chat: It marks one of the great celluloid pleasures of the year, so virtuosically written, performed, and filmed is it.","78","1193138"
"14162","On the mean streets, Devil is okay; but it's something special when it gets to Easy's street.","78","112857"
"14163","Strong, stirring, triumphant and tragic, The Imitation Game may be about a man who changed the world, but it’s also about the world that destroyed a man.","78","2084970"
"14164","If ever there were a happy summer movie, it’s Hairspray. But for all its bubbly musical numbers and effervescent good humor, this film adaptation of the hit Broadway musical feels oddly lacquered -- it’s John Waters by way of Disney.","78","427327"
"14165","While Hidden Figures is likable and illuminating, it is, nevertheless, routine and predictable.","78","4846340"
"14166","I, Tonya is a fairly conventional biopic of the scandalized sports star, but one buoyed by Margot Robbie's performance.","78","5580036"
"14167","While there are a few loose ends in Drew Goddard’s screenplay, which is faithful to but necessarily less detailed than its source, the film is a triumph of storytelling, a tribute to the power of the crowd-pleaser.","78","3659388"
"14168","Remarkable debut feature by New Yorker Ben Younger.","78","181984"
"14169","A simply flat-out fun film.","78","160127"

"14171","Boyle, MacDonald, and Hodge honed this wonderful coupling of music, visuals, and clever words, as well as a strange affection for toy babies, in their first film.","78","111149"
"14172","Director Espinosa stages the endless action with a tremendous flair that recalls John Woo's grittier moments, and cinematographer Oliver Wood, who shot Woo's finest Hollywood moment, ""Face/Off,"" gives the whole violent show a downright brackish look that borders on the sublime.","78","1599348"
"14173","It's 99 and 44/100% pure Mamet all the way.","78","252503"
"14174","The deeply heartfelt Milk is more of a surface skim: a fairly standard biopic – if a very fine one, indeed – but never the transcendent work one would have hoped from the filmmaker or his subject.","78","1013753"
"14175","Appearing in almost every frame of Blue Ruin, Blair – who previously starred in ""The Man From Orlando"" and writer/director Jeremy Saulnier’s first feature, ""Murder Party"" – owns this film.","78","2359024"
"14176","I recognized a lot of my younger self in The Edge of Seventeen. It’s crummy that teenagers just shy of 17 won’t get the same chance.","78","1878870"
"14177","Doesn't just raise the bar on sci-fi and action films, it rips that sucker off and sends it spiraling into the sun.","78","133093"
"14178","As far as I'm concerned, you can keep your Sean Penns and your Brad Pitts and your Frank Langellas; if there's any justice in the world, this year's best actor Academy Award will be going home with Rourke.","78","1125849"
"14179","All three principal actors – Weisz, McAdams, and Nivola – give effectively constrained performances. They work as a team here, consistent with the delicate balance in their characters’ complicated relationships with one another.","78","6108178"
"14180","I tried to imagine what it would be like watching this movie if I were unfamiliar with the source material. The story may be a bit strange, but certainly no less touching. That’s the thing about classics: Each reiteration, if done properly, puts us closer to the story at heart.","78","6225520"

"14182","My advice? Relinquish yourself to this hazy tapestry, and let the film take over. Squares need not apply.","78","1791528"
"14183","Visually, Batman Returns is marvelous to behold. There are images on that screen that make you laugh with delight and admiration for the sheer imaginativeness of it. But Burton also brings up some really interesting themes only to lose interest somewhere along the way.","78","103776"
"14184","Truthfully, it's hard to imagine a better screen adaptation of this queer household. Addams would have been proud.","78","101272"
"14185","With Henry Fool, however, Hartley has made his most dynamic and accomplished film to date.","78","122529"
"14186","Chronicle may go over the top with its climax, but for such a giddy film, it's remarkably down to earth.","78","1706593"
"14187","When Les Misérables is good, it is very, very good, and when it is bad, it's usually because Russell Crowe has opened his mouth.","78","1707386"
"14188","It's not so much the individual storylines that grab you, but Curtis’ unrelenting optimism. In the end, it's nice to know that love, actually, does conquer all.","78","314331"
"14189","A movie that’s so profoundly ridiculous that it has to be admired, if for no other reason other than its sheer willingness to run with its premise and take it to the end of the line.","78","319343"
"14190","Mostly succeeds in spite of the apparent strain to serve the agendas of both its loyal audience and its fledgling stars.","78","2848292"
"14191","Atomic Blonde is one of the best action films of the year.","78","2406566"
"14192","A very nasty piece of work, indeed.","78","114369"
"14193","It's a strange and electrifying brew of Hollywood genre tropes recalibrated for a globalized sensibility.","78","993842"
"14194","It's a simple set-up, it gets straight to the action, there's just enough personal drama to give the audience a good reason to root for the humans, and it's all just top-notch gory fun.","78","8364368"
"14195","Danner’s even better on her own, as she honestly, even angrily, wrangles with not a paradox, per se, just the raw rub of life: that it sucks to be alone, and it’s scary to try not being alone. She’s exquisite.","78","3236120"
"14196","Though Cuaron slips a time or two during his stylistic highwire act, his refreshingly original movie, aided by Hawke's career-best acting in the lead role, is a joy to watch.","78","119223"
"14197","The most memorable David vs. Goliath courtroom showdown in recent memory.","78","195685"
"14198","Even when the film doesn’t hang together perfectly, MacDougall maintains its momentum as his character painfully journeys toward a sense of acceptance. It may be only a few days into 2017, but this is a performance that you’ll remember for the rest of the year and beyond.","78","3416532"
"14199","What is lost in translation from Wolitzer’s novel is her particular vision of Joe – short, Brooklyn-born, Jewish – and her sidelong portrait of midcentury men of letters like Bellow and Roth. The Welsh-born Pryce makes a halfhearted swipe at mimicking an Outer Boroughs accent; he’s better at capturing Joe’s gluttony and overgrown-child sulks.","78","3750872"
"14200","What it lacks in charm, it compensates for with audacity and single-mindedness of vision.","78","103759"
"14201","The Guy Movie to end all Guy Movies, a ridiculously overblown summer testosterone blowout right down to the Wagnerian strains of the soundtrack and its stunningly high body count. It's also a hell of a lot of fun.","78","117500"
"14202","It’s odd and unfortunate, however, that The Return of the King just barely misses the eye-misting emotional wallop of the series’ previous installment, The Two Towers, which had a lyrical subtlety underpinning the vast vistas of growing chaos (and Christopher Lee hardly hurt matters) and hobbits-in-peril.","78","167260"
"14203","Annaud (The Lover, The Name of the Rose, Quest for Fire) may be, with all due respect to Stanley Kubrick, the most talented adapter of literary source material in recent film history. Seven Years confirms his mastery by doling out a perfect ratio of moving interpersonal drama and visual enchantment.","78","120102"
"14204","Spring Breakers is Korine’s most cogent take yet on society’s outsiders.","78","2101441"
"14205","The most originally funny movie to hit U.S. screens in a while.","78","425112"
"14206","The saga unfolds in a fairly charming fashion, and only Allen’s abrupt ending breaks the spell. Clearly, the filmmaker has no more ideas than Jasmine about how to resolve her predicament.","78","2334873"
"14207","It helps that J.K. Rowling’s third book in the series is full of spooky stuff that translates beautifully to screen.","78","304141"
"14208","In many ways, Animal Kingdom could have become a stylish but routine cops-and-robbers tale. Instead, Michôd shapes this film into a memorable character study about uncaged beasts.","78","1313092"
"14209","I laughed, I cried, I longed for a pet dragon to call my own.","78","1646971"
"14210","While sturdily constructed, Simon Beaufoy’s upbeat screenplay spells almost everything out in capital letters, with little nuance. It seldom trusts you to make your own judgments about the diverse cast of players in this chapter of pop-culture history.","78","4622512"
"14211","Stops along the way at a cell phone store and with the mother of a buddy killed in Vietnam (Tyson) provide opportunities for humor, poignancy, and reckonings with the useful lies told during wartime.","78","6018306"
"14212","A Perfect World is a gorgeous, sprawling road movie, full of unique characters (more or less -- Laura Dern's criminologist seems like some sort of PC afterthought, and Eastwood's grizzled Ranger borders on cliché) and arresting cinematography that reminds us why we live here in the first place.","78","107808"
"14213","This is Martin Scorsese, and in the end, it's his town, and his show.","78","163988"
"14214","While the story may be a common one (for the action genre, at least), Rodriguez, who wrote, produced, shot and edited the entire film himself, has a uniquely straightforward wit that makes what might otherwise have been just another shoot-'em-up something more than that.","78","104815"
"14215","Some of The Anniversary Party's titillation factor rests on the awareness that these are actors playing actors, in roles written specifically for them that at times appear awfully close to home.","78","254099"
"14216","And Favreau? If you'd told me 12 years ago that Swingers' comic linchpin would end up helming one of the best, most visceral, and downright fun foray of all the comic-book franchises waiting in the CGI wings, I'd have told you to amscray, kid. But what the hell? Turns out irony's good for your blood.","78","371746"
"14217","It's a disturbing film on many, many levels, but beautifully shot (by Seamus McGarvey) and shot through with a horrific sense of false hope. The kid is not all right.","78","1242460"
"14218","Surprisingly effective for what could easily be labeled a “gimmick film,” Chaganty’s debut feature suspenser unfolds entirely onscreen on screens.","78","7668870"
"14219","Hardly a serious caper film, Out of Sight instead takes a lighter approach, effortlessly offering up as many unexpected chuckles as it does bullets.","78","120780"
"14220","Not that he lacks artistry. When he delivers on tension, it's not a jump scare, but a jarring sense of inevitability (another kinship to Shults' work). Every time there is a sound above a whisper, there is a payoff, and how Krasinski navigates between those two events is never less than enthralling – and, yes, tragic.","78","6644200"
"14221","Philomena honors its namesake by valuing potent understatement over potential hysterics.","78","2431286"
"14222","Humor is a key ingredient in Kafka, though it definitely leans toward the wry and quirky. The movie loses some of its clarity and narrative force in mid-story however, though it never abandons its original visual style and focus.","78","102181"
"14223","Like its protagonist, it never hands you explanations on a silver platter, and it makes you think a bit, something far too few thrillers do these days.","78","258463"
"14224","Fans of all that has come before (excluding Roger Corman's premature-ejaculation version of ""The Fantastic Four,"" natch) will weep tears of giddy joy at how crowd-pleasingly cohesive – and ridiculously fun – this film is.","78","848228"
"14225","For once, the Coen brothers' neurotic filmmaking style works to their advantage; it's giddily appropriate for a movie about a man who's losing his mind.","78","101410"
"14226","It's a period piece about the origins of psychoanalysis and the sexual confusions of its progenitors that is eloquent and handsomely made, if never quite revelatory.","78","1571222"
"14227","If this movie does anything to rally crowds against cinema's mass distribution of mediocrity then it has served a noble purse.","78","173716"
"14228","Five years after Ang Lee attempted a stylistically and narratively daring reimagining of what a comic-book movie could be (an example that tanked disastrously at the box office), the big green gamma-guy returns to the screen in a purer, more unadulterated, vastly more entertaining form.","78","800080"
"14229","While the climax is admittedly something of a letdown after all the build-up, it's a hopelessly, helplessly original film, all guts, no glory.","78","364569"
"14230","An absorbing, delightful, and nuanced movie with laugh-out-loud humor, and though it often plays events broadly where you might have preferred subtlety, it's not a movie that could have settled for muffled silence.","78","114388"
"14231","The Hunger Games is first and foremost an adventure/survival story, and director Ross keeps things moving with nary a moment of downtime. There's precious little fat on the script; it's a lean, mean antifascist machine, and Lawrence is at once winsome and spectacularly engaging as Katniss (so much so that all her male costars pale into near-blandness in comparison).","78","1392170"
"14232","The Lost World (unlike Spielberg's original film) leaps head first into the action, rushing, it seems, to get the film's real stars -- the dinosaurs -- to the screen as quickly as possible, and it does so with considerable verve.","78","119567"
"14233","Frozen River skates matter-of-factly on thin ice.","78","978759"
"14234","Stays remarkably true to a kid's-eye perspective and dormant fears.","78","327597"
"14235","All in all, In the Mouth of Madness is a fun, clever horror picture, full of creepy crawlies, things that go bump in the night, and references to everyone from H.P. Lovecraft to Dario Argento.","78","113409"
"14236","A peerless fusing of dumbshow performance and background sound editing, there's a rising panic that allows the final, violent closing act to seem shockingly organic.","78","6002232"
"14237","The upshot to a ticking bomb is that it only explodes the once, but Rachel's sister, Kym (Hathaway), goes off again and again.","78","1084950"
"14238","It’s bravura, classic Hollywood filmmaking, and you like to think that Hughes himself would have viewed it, if not appreciatively, then at least with a sense of kinship.","78","338751"
"14239","Lyne's excesses are usually the kind of thing I love to hate, but Unfaithful found me pretty much following along in step with his rhythms and dramatic choices.","78","250797"
"14240","Funny, bewildering, giddy spectacle.","78","362270"
"14241","The World’s End affectionately takes a page from our Fifties sci-fi films.","78","1213663"
"14242","Nolan creates an effective thriller, although he keeps his stylistic pyrotechnics to a minimum.","78","278504"
"14243","Queen & Slim artfully weaves together a lovers-on-the-lam crime story with very trenchant Black Lives Matter thematic content. It is a perfect movie for our times. It grabs you by the scruff during its flawless opening sequences and never lets go, despite some episodic contrivances that occasionally cause it to feel overplotted.","78","8722346"
"14244","With Calvary, John Michael McDonagh (who wrote and directed ""The Guard"" and is the brother of Martin “In Bruges” McDonagh) has crafted a darkly hilarious and deeply ruminative update on the passion play.","78","2234003"
"14245","If you scratch the surface too deeply, a few things might not ring true, but there’s no greater pleasure to be had than the film’s opening and closing sequences during which Murray, alone on the screen, dances, then sings along to the music coming through his headphones.","78","2170593"
"14246","Ambitious, brutish, ruthlessly unromantic – has the right idea casting its heroine as a Joan of Arc-type crusader and its evil queen a dissertation (albeit first draft) on beauty as the most direct path to power for the disenfranchised female.","78","1735898"
"14247","If you're fed up with the stultifying, formula-driven character of today's mainstream films, give Fallen Angels a try. At the very least you'll be engaged, and if you're lucky you may just recapture some of your original wonder at the seductive power of movies.","78","112913"
"14248","Creed isn’t a complete TKO, but it goes all 12 rounds with vitality and flourish.","78","3076658"
"14249","There is, quite simply, a rather refreshing ordinariness to Remember Me in the unflashy, knuckle-down attention it gives to character development and the building of plausible and involving family and friend dynamics.","78","1403981"
"14250","For all the pratfalls, this is a grim, dispiriting work. It dares not to be liked, and there’s a lot to like in that daringness.","78","4686844"
"14251","Actor-screenwriter Favreau and director Liman demonstrate with Swingers that they're definitely ""money.""","78","117802"
"14252","It's definitely quite the spectacle as directed by the modern-day king of epics, David Lean. The movie is something that should be experienced by everyone at least once in a lifetime.","78","59113"
"14253","It’s hypnotic just how horrifying Arthur’s existence is, just as Phoenix’s performance is hypnotic as he spirals from fragile hope into increasingly outsized and confident acts of destruction.","78","7286456"
"14254","What's so intensely pleasurable about The Artist, however, is not its predetermined seriocomic trajectory but the endless parade of smartly creative and self-referential gags, which include all manner of sly, silent delights; the inevitable Jack Russell; and even an extended orchestral cue of Bernard Herrmann's, cribbed outright from ""Vertigo.""","78","1655442"
"14255","Williams' shape-shifting, gag-spouting, celebrity-impersonating Genie is truly a hurricane in a bottle. His manic energy and hip humor are so exhilarating that the rest of the movie risks grinding to a halt whenever he's not onscreen.","78","103639"
"14256","Yes, Boy Erased is a horror movie, but it bears pointing out that the emotion is by definition intertwined with both empathy and a certain sense of compassion. Terror elicits a shriek. Horror hits you in the heart, and the next thing you know you’re sobbing. Bring some tissues.","78","7008872"
"14257","The best comic-book movie in a long time, though based on no comic, Lucy is a film that mates classic Besson with Quentin Tarantino in a go at the mystical, world-solving vision found in Stanley Kubrick’s ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and Terrence Malick’s ""The Tree of Life.""","78","2872732"
"14258","Durkin's film seems to exist in its own fractured dream state. It's hypnotic, narcotic, and trembling on the verge of either dread or redemption or some hazy state of nothingness in between.","78","1441326"
"14259","The film is one big advertisement for the multicolored building blocks from which it’s made. The Lego Movie may be the shrewdest marketing ploy you’ve ever seen.","78","1490017"
"14260","Easily one of Disney’s more imaginative and detail-oriented CGI offerings in a while, Zootopia uses the classic tropes of anthropomorphized animals and comic references to pop-culture touchstones to slyly puzzle out what it means to be “civilized.”","78","2948356"
"14261","The kind of quiet, effective film that burrows under the viewer's skin and takes root before you've had a chance to realize that it's permeated your constitutional makeup.","78","285742"
"14262","It's a straight-ahead caper flick, very cool, and very, very Seventies (although it takes place in 1995), from production and costume design on down to the soundtrack.","78","119396"
"14263","Laika's stop-motion animation is every bit as inspired here as it was in their rightfully lauded ""Coraline,"" and the storyline never wavers from its boneyard-deep message: Being different from others is a good – nay, great – thing, no matter how many villagers (or zombies) are after you.","78","1623288"
"14264","Even when The Tree of Life does not achieve the heights for which it aims, it soars boldly and fearlessly.","78","478304"
"14265","It is filled with unsettling imagery and a paranoiac atmosphere, and has a wicked slant on the horror genre’s obsession with burgeoning sexuality. You’re not likely to shake it anytime soon.","78","3235888"
"14266","You don't just root for Harold and Kumar to get the girl, get the weed, and, above all, get the burger – you want to hang out with them while they' doing it, and see if they'e free next Friday night, too.","78","366551"
"14267","A spirited and eye-popping stealth charmer.","78","481499"
"14268","There’s gore, all right, although the real terror lies in the tease, and the often dark, herky-jerky DV format ratchets up the tension to an almost unbearable degree.","78","289043"
"14269","Infamous successfully captures a sense of the loneliness of a writer's life.","78","420609"
"14270","Stone makes it virtually impossible to leave the theatre convinced, beyond all shadow of doubt, of the lone gunman theory.","78","102138"
"14271","The constant singing and dancing throughout is charmingly presented, and the CGI recreations of Antarctica are stunning.","78","366548"
"14272","The Double taps into a deep reservoir of psychic turmoil even as it navigates the script’s abundant jokes, and the nightmare of the heart of the film is doubtless universal.","78","1825157"
"14273","Isn't Lee's most personal piece, but it may very well be his most mature.","78","307901"
"14274","Timely metaphors abound in The Order of the Phoenix, but the story (of which there is much) stands on its own magical merits, dark and darker still though they may be.","78","373889"
"14275","An outstanding cast have crafted a delicate, eloquent picture of believable humans in so many gradations of hurt, but it stops just shy of catharsis.","78","1714206"
"14276","Perhaps every decade gets the Jane Eyre it deserves: Is the emphasis of conscience over passion emblematic of our times?","78","1229822"
"14277","Brilliant, surreal, and emotionally draining, this first feature from American Film Institute grad Aronofsky recalls such low-budget sci-fi epics as ""Tetsuo: The Iron Man"" and more traditional paranoiac suspense films (Adrian Lyne's ""Jacob's Ladder"" in particular, but also Polanski's ""Rosemary's Baby"") and yet manages to be a wholly original animal.","78","138704"
"14278","Of course, Slither isn't for everyone, but if you've a yen for gallons of grue and a smart, sassy story to boot, you couldn't do better than Gunn's hellishly fun horror show.","78","439815"
"14279","Movies about writers can be notorious slogs but, amazingly, The End of the Tour is not one of those films. In fact, it is so much better than any movie based primarily on conversations has any right to be.","78","3416744"
"14280","It's not perfect -- Thornton's slack-jawed yokel Jacob is played a bit wide of the mark and Fonda continues to irk in some indefinable way -- but it's a revelation for longtime Raimi fans. And it's a hell of a ride too, for both Raimi fans and newcomers alike.","78","120324"
"14281","Succeeds as a moody, evocative, and pleasing film, one that underscores its indie roots in sentiment as well as style","78","279113"
"14282","The film’s love for its subjects is mirrored in their passionate frenzy for words, and language – spoken, written, body – in general. Above all, and what sets it apart from other cinematic takes on the Beatified, is how much fun it is. It may end in tears, but then, don’t all great love stories?","78","1311071"
"14283","Biller infuses the film with such style, such elegance, such joie de vivre, that I had a smile on my face for the whole running time.","78","3908142"
"14284","This film is a pleasurable experience, but it’s a frustrating one as well. There’s a nagging feeling we should expect something more from this guy. To borrow the most quotable line of dialogue from ""The Room"" (bellowed at the top of the lungs): “YOU ARE TEARING ME APART, FRANCO!”","78","3521126"
"14285","The best Scorsese we've seen in a decade.","78","217505"
"14286","Qualitatively different from its cinematic forbears: It doesn't linger on the gothic curlicues of its source material, it moves straightforwardly from place to place, and it emphasizes the emotional development of its characters with dramatic interplay rather than expressionistic, atmospheric gloom.","78","330373"
"14287","It's a thumping good adventure.","78","110357"
"14288","Without preaching from the pulpit, A Fantastic Woman powerfully communicates the hostility and hatred that persons such as Marina encounter simply due to their otherness. In its way, it resembles those Hollywood-era message movies like ""Gentleman’s Agreement"" and ""Pinky,"" but without the self-congratulatory importance that weighs those films down with all the subtlety of an iron anchor.","78","5639354"
"14289","Bruckheimer -– always eager to egg on the public’s thirst for bigger, louder, stupider –- has done a scandalous amount of damage to contemporary cinema, but for once, his dubious talent for big-buck bombast is exploited for good rather than evil.","78","325980"
"14290","You can easily lose five minutes making sense of it - and another 10 poking holes in it - but what of it? The preceding 100 minutes pass so pleasurably, the few false moves barely register - maybe the biggest con of all, but consider me happily snowed.","78","325805"
"14291","Reilly, Phoenix, Gyllenhaal, and Ahmed – a murderers’ row of outstanding character actors who all moonlight as leading men – take the script’s raw materials (daddy issues, the trauma of being bullied, the civilizing effect of a toothbrush) and forge new bonds with a few words, a light look. The film treats their growing intimacy, in all its permutations, like an objet d’art, to be turned over and examined, delicately, from every angle. When they’re together, the film is electric.","78","4971344"
"14292","To a one, they nail the humor, all right, but they also, quite crucially, humanize the high concept.","78","471042"
"14293","If Honey Boy was just the actor doing primal scream therapy at the camera for 93 minutes, we'd arguably be obligated to watch it. But that he delivers a captivating, haunting, and brutally honest exploration of a life we think we know.","78","8151874"
"14294","While We’re Young struggles to reconcile its protagonists’ rival impulses to either welcome an unexpected source of youthful vitality with open arms or embrace such an individual so as to better displace them from one’s lawn.","78","1791682"
"14295","This, uh, wonderfully directed and near-perfectly cast iconic heroine female empowerment story is so similar in tone and feel to Marvel Studios’ ""Captain America"" that I was waiting for Stan Lee to show up, possibly as a eunuch.","78","451279"
"14296","One of the rare movies that communicates honestly and artfully about the real casualties of war: the surviving combatants.","78","790712"
"14297","Overall, it’s a satisfying wintry treat, as only Quentin Tarantino can do it.","78","3460252"
"14298","It isn't about where you get, but how you get there -- and the getting there is a chewy delight.","78","280707"
"14299","Like the doomed vessel from which it takes its tale, Cameron's film is a behemoth, svelte, streamlined, and not the least bit ponderous.","78","120338"
"14300","A slam-bang, sci-fi actioner, relentlessly paced and edited, with a pounding soundtrack and some ingenious aliens courtesy of Berni Wrightson and KNB Effects.","78","133751"
"14301","Before lapsing into the land of the insipid,... John Hughes actually made a few movies that shined some light on the trials of modern adolescence. The Breakfast Club is one of them.","78","88847"
"14302","Greengrass and co. may have made one of the best action movies in recent memory.","78","440963"
"14303","Hell or High Water is a good but not great movie with sensational lead performances that elevate it to enjoyably memorable status.","78","2582782"
"14304","This skillfully creepy film tells the story of some housemates who experience unwelcome visits from a partially decomposed former resident who rises from beneath the floorboards. Seems he wants the flesh and blood of the new residents in order to settle some old scores.","78","93177"
"14305","Kingsman: The Secret Service may lack the sophistication of its peers, but damned if it doesn’t know how to have a good time.","78","2802144"
"14306","It smarts, and shocks, and just for a moment blows your mind.","78","203119"
"14307","Loaded with sass, sex, and sadistic violence, Deadpool is not your youngster’s comic-book origin story. Deadpool earns every bit of its R rating, a quality that’s sure to appeal to fans weary of the macho, apple-pie-eating, altruistic superheroes who buck for attention in the comic-book stables.","78","1431045"
"14308","Boys on the Side is surprisingly effective, although its narrative often advances awkwardly.","78","112571"
"14309","It takes a village, I've heard it said. It takes a village not only to raise a child but also, in this case, to aid the delusional and help restore good mental health. Or so Lars and the Real Girl would have us believe.","78","805564"
"14310","The movie’s wit and energy hold your interest, but they don’t spark the pleasure of the unexpected, the thrill you felt in ""Laura,"" ""The Last of Sheila,"" ""Chinatown,"" ""The Sixth Sense,"" or the 1974 adaptation of Christie’s ""Murder on the Orient Express"" (not Kenneth Branagh’s inept remake), movies whose big reveals surprise you in their elegant simplicity.","78","8946378"
"14311","Some have remarked that The Post is the story of Kay transforming into Katharine Graham, which is pretty on the mark.","78","6294822"
"14312","Take Shelter is a deeply unsettling movie. Writer/director Jeff Nichols (an Austin resident and director of the award-winning 2007 feature ""Shotgun Stories"") doles out information as strategically as a government official.","78","1675192"
"14313","Dunye's film is smart, sexy (the interracial lesbian lovemaking scene prompted an infamous little ruckus over at the NEA a while back), funny, historically aware, and stunningly contemporary.","78","118125"
"14314","The Hangover instantly has the feel of one for the ages.","78","1119646"
"14315","Yet for all its unmistakable visual trademarks (hypersaturated colors; mad-scientist tinkering with film stocks and editing technique; sudden presentation of enigmatic, troubling images), this is also the most radical departure Stone has ever made in terms of basic sensibilities.","78","120399"
"14316","Depending on your perspective, Moonee is either youth incarnate making the most of her circumstances, or Dennis the Menace determined to drive the oldsters stark-raving mad. Her escapades eventually take a turn from boisterously fun-loving to downright dangerous, which kicks the movie’s low simmer into full boil.","78","5649144"
"14317","So much of the credit must be laid at the feet of Ian McKellen, whose portrait of Whale is a study in acting excellence.","78","120684"
"14318","The Adjustment Bureau is, above all, a romance of chance and chaos theory of the heart. (In this respect, some viewers will recognize it as kin to the early Gwyneth Paltrow fantasy ""Sliding Doors."")","78","1385826"
"14319","Haunts the memory long after you've left the theatre.","78","180093"
"14320","I said once before that every generation gets the superhero it deserves, and Nolan's darkest of dark knights is surely ours – and no more so than in this current incarnation. (Granted, this doesn't bode well for society, but hey, things are bleak all over.)","78","1345836"
"14321","Elgort’s performance is more mannered than Woodley’s open-faced, direct line to the heart, but it works.","78","2582846"
"14322","The filmmaker has created a haunting movie, one that connects on a visceral level that defies easy explication. The unembellished performances by Cotillard and Schoenaerts exude a raw authenticity that anchor the film's grander melodrama and embed the characters in the viewer's memory.","78","2053425"
"14323","There is a sense of ambiguity at the core of The Reader that makes it all the more brutal, all the more honest in its deflowering of love and what one imagines love ought to be instead of what it too often is.","78","976051"
"14324","If there's one error, it's that there are almost too many laughs. Cannon keeps the pace up, and some of the smart one-liners from the script by Brian and Jim Kehoe get stamped on in the race for the next gag.","78","2531344"
"14325","Ford's Indy, who doesn't quite hang up his fedora at film's end, is still the only cinematic smartass-cum-bullwhipping scholar of antiquities I'd want by my side when push comes to shove comes to Nazis (""I hate these guys""), Russkies, or, for that matter, Al Quaeda. Go get 'em, Indy, and cue the John Williams while you''e at it.","78","367882"
"14326","If, at times, Shine's luster reveals more elbow grease than internal radiance, the movie is still a moving tribute to the human capacity to overcome all odds.","78","117631"
"14327","Eye in the Sky maintains nerve-racking suspense throughout its running time and explicates some of the unknown nuances of drone warfare. Plus, you know, Alan Rickman is reason enough to see it.","78","2057392"
"14328","Cotillard doesn't look part Native American or sound like a Thirties Chicago moll, but damned if she isn't a sight and sound to behold. Whatever her technical limitations, she rises above them to breathe a flesh, blood, and battered verisimilitude into the part. You can't tear your eyes off her, any more than you can Mann's flawed but still engrossing picture.","78","1152836"
"14329","It's a winning formula, and when done right like it is here, it transcends the clichés and moves audiences.","78","410097"
"14330","A lively action picture with a spirited sense of humor, Broken Arrow is a great deal of fun, even if it isn't exactly a return to form for its celebrated director, former Hong Kong action auteur John Woo.","78","115759"
"14331","A tour de force of modern cinema.","78","318034"
"14332","Reality has overtaken the movies here, which, I suppose, makes T3 all the more cathartically appealing. At least onscreen we have Arnold Schwarzenegger in our corner.","78","181852"
"14333","Affleck's greatest talent, however, may lie in his casting instincts: In addition to the above-mentioned turns by Arkin and Goodman, stand-out performances are also delivered by Bryan Cranston as Mendez's boss and Victor Garber as the morally heroic Canadian ambassador to Iran.","78","1024648"
"14334","The main draw here, besides the nature of the high-stakes poker milieu, is Jessica Chastain.","78","4209788"
"14335","Nolan’s end-act pacing has always felt ponderous – but it’s not enough to ruin what is surely the most intellectually and viscerally engaging action film in years. The soul doesn’t stir, no, but everything else is wildly somersaulting.","78","1375666"
"14336","Ranks as one of the season's most intelligent and polished films.","78","1124035"
"14337","One of the most eloquent tales in ages of dysfunctional love – between a man and his ideals, between a country and its government, and, in the end, between Evey and V.","78","434409"
"14338","All of the major players turn in powerhouse performances, and Fishburne nails his best role yet as Furious.","78","101507"
"14339","As light on his feet as he is as a musical-comedy showman, Jackman is perversely even more pleasurable when he’s popping neck veins from the effort of heavy drama.","78","3315342"
"14340","LaBeouf plays Jacob as no naif – he can be as slippery and savage as the next suit – but there's also real tenderness in his scenes with Mulligan and Langella (in a small but significant role as Jacob's mentor).","78","1027718"
"14341","A touching (and at times horrific) -- albeit overlong -- Christ allegory, that scores not so much on the strength of its convictions as it does on the truly remarkable performances it elicits from the cast.","78","120689"
"14342","Besson's visuals are, as always, vibrant and decidedly European. He fills the frames with odd-angled shots and alarming riots of color that catch you off-balance.","78","110413"
"14343","It's the best-looking film of the year, hands down, and Thornton is dazzling, a dull diamond in the gutter rough.","78","243133"
"14344","Seemingly taking its cue from Belfort’s shenanigans, the film is completely without modulation. It starts with all the knobs cranked up to 11 and remains that way for the next three hours. While what’s onscreen is never uninteresting, its unrelentingness is exhausting.","78","993846"
"14345","The Birth of a Nation most definitely has its finger on the pulse of our times.","78","4196450"
"14346","Bridges makes this sozzled and desperate ex-desperado – a cliché by any other name – as fresh and vital as one final shot at cowboy-poet redemption. It may sound crazy, but it's true.","78","1263670"
"14347","The swarming dragon attacks may truly frighten the littlest viewers, but the depiction of the pleasures of flight and the conquering of one’s fears should make How to Train Your Dragon a perennial delight.","78","892769"
"14348","Jackie has a nightmare vibe to it that’s palpable and unsettling, and Portman’s performance as the widowed first lady is a tour de force of conflicting emotions brought on by the impossibly ghastly reality bookending that sunny day in Dallas.","78","1619029"
"14349","For no matter how derivative this carefully calculated sentimental journey may be, there’s still an undeniable magic in its voice and its step likely to enchant adults – and hopefully kids – alike. Uncle Walt would be proud.","78","5028340"
"14350","However commanding and absorbing Three Billboards may be, the film is diminished by its neatness and unconvincing resolutions to the many dilemmas it puts into play.","78","5027774"
"14351","A funny, seductive, and surprisingly honest dramatization of the ways we snooker ourselves into incompatible love.","78","1022603"
"14352","A devastating and weighty picture.","78","315733"
"14353","A political thriller with topical currency, Spartan delivers the goods.","78","360009"
"14354","In the game of eXistenZ it's not whether you win or lose, but how you play the game.","78","120907"
"14355","It is an inspired, strange, and occasionally choke-on-your-popcorn funny ensemble piece that, frankly, blows just about every other current comedy out of the water.","78","1931533"
"14356","An incredibly evocative film and one of the most evocative neo-Westerns of the past decade.","78","5057140"
"14357","It grabs you by the viscera in the opening prologue and for the next two hours rarely lets go.","78","106582"
"14358","No doubt about it: Bad Santa is blasphemous. But, to borrow a phrase from another famous hedonist, Homer Simpson, it’s also sacrilicious.","78","307987"
"14359","Wonderstruck’s portrayal of deaf experiences and its adult treatment of childhood mysteries are original, and the way Haynes weaves it all together with gossamer strands gives this movie wings.","78","5208216"
"14360","The movie appeals to an old-fashioned sense of horror.","78","450385"
"14361","A film that is at once elegant and sublimely silly.","78","910936"
"14362","David Lynch doesn't tell stories as much as he shows hallucinations. Wierd, wild, excessive, obsessive, idiosyncratic visions.","78","100935"
"14363","It's not the crowning achievement in Steven Spielberg's oeuvre, but Minority Report stands on its own sturdy sci-fi legs, and there's no sign of that little imp Haley Joel Osment, to boot, thankfully.","78","181689"
"14364","What takes The Theory of Everything into the cosmos is Redmayne’s extraordinary performance. The disciplined precision with which he progressively embodies Hawking’s failing body is nothing short of astonishing.","78","2980516"
"14365","Fraser, Martin, and the rest of the flesh-and-blood characters look like they’re having a ball, which translates instantly to the audience as well.","78","318155"
"14366","Fighting With My Family delivers on comedy, action, and a sweet message of acceptance and strength at its core. It might be a bit too wrestling-heavy for some, but the strong cast, interesting real life story, and a magnetic lead mean this black sheep sports story is a feel-good flick with chops that might finally put WWE Studios on the map.","78","6513120"
"14367","If Wadjda, this Muslim girl, calls up film memories of adolescent Marjane Satrapi in ""Persepolis"", whose Western-loving lifestyle is uprooted by Iran’s Islamic Revolution, or the young women in Jafar Panahi’s ""Offside,"" who countermand the rules that forbid them from entering stadiums to watch men’s soccer matches, you wouldn’t be far off the mark.","78","2258858"
"14368","If anything, A Few Good Men errs by throwing almost too many elements, themes and moral debates into the mix thus, by default, they sometimes seem shallowly developed and overly simple. Then again, that perhaps allows them to connect with more universal experiences.","78","104257"
"14369","Despite this film's narrative lapses, Malick has a unique way of distilling the poetry from the commonplace -- and for that precious gift we should say amen.","78","120863"
"14370","Not only does this genre exercise deliver the little jolts and inside laughs that keep modern horror fans pleased, Get Out is also one of the smartest, funniest, and most socially astute films to come around in a while.","78","5052448"
"14371","It’s nowhere near as soulful or questing as ""2001"" or ""Moon"" – but as popcorn entertainment, it’s surprisingly provocative.","78","1355644"
"14372","The atrocities against children begin to acquire an unwelcome redundancy in their relentlessness and threaten to inure the viewer.","78","1365050"
"14373","Wonderfully fun, albeit markedly chaotic and incoherent.","78","86856"
"14374","Boden and Fleck's unabashedly warmhearted film is a sensitively wrought but also very funny portrait of the way we respond to pressure.","78","804497"
"14375","The storyline is something of a hodge-podge but what the narrative lacks in honing and straight-ahead storytelling it more than makes up for with well-aimed barbs and acutely focused observations...this funny, funny satire gets us where we live.","78","151804"
"14376","It's not perfect -- thank Satan! -- but Hellboy II: The Golden Army is by far the most splendidly imaginative and creatively uncorked piece of fantastic cinema since the director's ""Pan's Labyrinth"" netted an Oscar trifecta in 2007.","78","411477"
"14377","The movie brims with unexpected zest, an enthralling joie de vivre that seduces despite any reservations you may have.","78","2771200"
"14378","This is smart, quirky, frequently laugh-out-loud comedy, in all seriousness.","78","1477837"
"14379","Yet the genius of Her Smell is that it's not about Becky. It's about the chaos she causes. Moss and Perry could let her dominate the frame as she does the room, but each sequence is about how everyone else deals with the damage she leaves behind.","78","7942742"
"14380","The sights are ingenious, impressively rendered in 3-D, and the sounds – including cheeky voice work by Mr. T, Neil Patrick Harris, and Benjamin Bratt – are a blast.","78","844471"
"14381","You've got to hand it to Reynolds, director Cortés, and screenwriter Chris Sparling; they milk every single frisson of nail-ripping anxiety from a stunningly simple – yet universally recognized and dreaded – conceit and then cap it with a payoff of molar-pulverizing intensity.","78","1462758"
"14382","Cooper mostly tamps down that Sexiest Man Alive demeanor that follows him from film to film, and Lawrence – a continually startling young talent – counterpoises her Bardot beauty with a blistering snarl. They both play hurt people clawing their way toward wellness, but it's Lawrence who makes you feel the hurt in your heart – and the hope that it'll get better soon.","78","1045658"
"14383","Austin Powers is the kind of movie Mel Brooks used to make -- extravagantly funny, with plenty of juvenile humor, but as much or more of it smart, delivered with a dead aim at a cultural milestone, affection for its victim, and style.","78","118655"
"14384","It's a hilarious, scathing look at one man's attempt to get a film made, whatever it takes, and it may be the most realistic depiction of that struggle so far.","78","113677"
"14385","The less said about The Ring, the better for you, the sooner-to-be-freaked-out.","78","298130"
"14386","Ultimately, Frost/Nixon may be stuck in time – but, oh, what a time it was.","78","870111"
"14387","It’s not hard to imagine a young audience completely losing their minds over the thrills and action of Thor: Ragnarok, and then loving it all over again when they realize how funny it is.","78","3501632"
"14388","Bridges is another example of Eastwood's remarkable economy of style as both a director and an actor. It is neither his best work nor his worst, though it is a fascinating exploration.","78","112579"
"14389","A kicky, knockout thriller that ingeniously taps into the current climate of paranoia surrounding personal privacy in the Information Age.","78","120660"
"14390","Gleefully, goofily over-the-top.","78","132347"
"14391","The result is a climactic scene that is pretty near perfect: both laugh-out-loud surprising and endearingly inevitable.","78","449059"
"14392","Certainly one of the most lovingly crafted, end-of-the-world, cinematic feasts ever made, a spectacle of destruction and survival not even C.B DeMille could have envisioned.","78","407304"
"14393","The film is an exhilarating and inventive spectacle that makes every other action film from the last 10 years look as obsolete as the Lumière brothers running that train at you back in 1896.","78","3072482"
"14394","It's a kick, it's a gas, and it gives the Rat Pack itself a run for its money.","78","240772"
"14395","Let’s be honest: With a cast like this, it doesn't matter too much what the characters are doing onscreen, or if it makes about as much sense as a monochrome rainbow.","78","349903"
"14396","Too much is tossed into the ring and the last hour becomes a frantic swell of emotions and ideas, not all of which are exactly on point.","78","215545"
"14397","It's easy enough to forget there are special effects involved, so convincing is Stu's rippling fur and big beamy eyes filling up with tears.","78","243585"
"14398","The good news is Craig, who was riveting as a London pharmaceutical salesman in the recent Brit import ""Layer Cake,"" is equally mesmerizing here.","78","381061"
"14399","Capernaum is as close to unfiltered truth as the screen or the audience can handle. Set in the slums of Beirut, it is an eye-opening insight into life at the frayed fringes of a society that seems seconds from unraveling.","78","8267604"
"14400","Farmers’ market jokes and “desert vibes” hashtags aside, Ingrid Goes West cuts to the quick, ultimately revealing a toxic, yet oh-so-appealing demeanor that has come to define our current existence.","78","5962210"
"14401","Full of period locations, costumes, and one very clever Lana Turner gag, it's easy to see why Ellroy is so pleased with the film.","78","119488"
"14402","It's a consistently entertaining story.","78","120824"
"14403","A surprisingly warmhearted examination of hypocrisy and social insecurity, unlikely camaraderie and stutter-stepped formation of adult identity.","78","1282140"
"14404","The story's parallels with the present are sometimes inescapable, as when Saladin's fireballs catapulted at Balian's castle strike an eerie resemblance to the ""shock and awe"" of the U.S.-led coalition's initial assault on Iraq.","78","320661"
"14405","Buoyed by a soundtrack that’ll have fortysomethings cracking open 40-ounces and recalling a marginally simpler, if still chaotic, time in their lives, Straight Outta Compton’s bark is just as snarly-cool as its bite. Take that, Tipper Gore.","78","1398426"
"14406","A valentine to the happenstance miracle of lovers and other strangers, a movie that regards modern romance as something that is, ultimately, old-fashioned to its core.","78","128853"
"14407","Deliciously bleak, black political satire from British director Armando Iannucci.","78","1226774"
"14408","What's fascinating is the depth of humanity Cruise finds within the character of Jerry and also Cruise's generosity toward the other actors in the story -- a generosity that allows all the other performers to shine and create vivid and memorable characters.","78","116695"
"14409","Although a few bits (the film is done in blackout sketch style) fall flat and a good ten minutes could be shaved off the running time with no visible damage, it's an impressive and irascible debut that rings true even when you're laughing too hard to hear it.","78","109445"
"14410","Interestingly, Coppola has eschewed state-of-the-art special effects in favor of a panoply of archaic film-school tricks -- reversing the film, multiple exposures, playing with the shutter speed -- that give his Dracula a stylized, almost hyper-real clarity and a wonderfully singular weirdness.","78","103874"
"14411","Sicario is at its best when its borderlines are fluid and indistinct.","78","3397884"

"14414","An amazing, bracing, funny, audacious, tender, and sobering piece of filmmaking. Few movies have ever dared to be this remorseless in their portraits of addiction.","78","113627"
"14415","Hungarian cinematographer Marcell Rév puts himself in the top echelons with his kinetic, vibrant work here, smashing Jacques Jouffret's neon-and-blood visual thrills from ""The Purge"" series into suburbia with a slick and easy violence, and when the world breaks down – as in one of the most brilliant and sickening home invasions ever filmed – he makes the stylish chaos all too believable.","78","6205872"
"14416","With The Guest, Wingard and Barrett have once more upped the ante for the indie horror flick pack.","78","2980592"
"14417","It’s a juicy role for any actress, but Lawrence takes it two or three steps further than anyone else who comes to mind could. She’s a true original, a rara avis with beautiful plumage.","78","1800241"
"14418","A deeply soulful film, shot through with loss, regret, and hope. Like almost all great sci-fi films it’s less about the alien unknown than it is about the human condition.","78","2543164"
"14419","In short, the actors deserve a big round of applause -– especially Affleck, for finally wiping the smug look off of his face (OK, 80% smug-free); Garner, for her dead sexy mix of attitude and adrenaline; and the grunting, googly-eyed Farrell, for … well, for being ""fookin’"" nuts, I guess.","78","287978"
"14420","Dallas Buyers Club is an indelible story about one man’s unwillingness to go gently into that good night, and the personal growth he experiences along the way.","78","790636"
"14421","A stroll with these characters is a refreshing break from from the usual film exercises.","78","878835"
"14422","A countrified, monolithic thing of beauty -- gorgeous to behold despite the fact that its overlong two-hour-and-45-minute running time plays off Redford's weather-beaten golden boy good looks far too often for its own good.","78","119314"
"14423","The strangest biographical film ever made is also one of the most charming, melancholy and quirkily humorous films of the year.","78","109707"

"14426","Quite simply, Midnight in Paris is charming – très charmant, to ape the argot of the locals. I say that somewhat tongue-in-cheek, as this is very much an outsider's valentine to the City of Lights.","78","1605783"

"14429","Mistress America is maybe Baumbach’s most probing consideration of the writer’s process and development, a continuing point of interest in his filmography, from ""Kicking and Screaming"" to ""The Squid and the Whale"" and ""Margot at the Wedding.""","78","2872462"
"14430","Although Ferrara's Body Snatchers might not be the preferred among the three versions, it is nevertheless a clever reading of the story. The decision to start the pod plot within the military is a great one, and there's a disconcerting lack of privacy for the Anwar character.","78","106452"
"14431","In the end, Machete may not be all that original, but it is fresh – fresh as a steel blade to the gut.","78","985694"

"14433","Is it fair to say that Jordan Peele is this generation’s John Carpenter? With his sly grasp of the intersection of popcorn thrills and political allegory, it’s a reasonable comparison. After he provided an Oscar-worthy analysis of race relations in ""Get Out,"" now America’s id is probed in Us.","78","6857112"
"14434","As with ""Sunshine,"" I'd call Juno a family film if only it didn't make teen pregnancy look so sporting. Instead, we'll settle for that rare bird, an indie comedy that uplifts – funny and smart, totally trying to be cool and succeeding, and heartfelt to boot.","78","467406"
"14435","The problematic issue of “keeping up with the Joneses” has rarely played as delicately or as honestly as it does here.","78","5884230"

"14437","While there is poetic grace, that's not to say that there's no didacticism. Like Baldwin, Jenkins has a rigorous sense of what is broken in society.","78","7125860"
"14438","It's a knockout, sucker punch of a performance, and although it doesn't completely erase the memory of Rapace (and why should it?), Mara's doomy gaze cuts through the hype and bores straight into your soul.","78","1568346"
"14439","Slash is an endearing, sweet, and altogether badass ode to being young, weird, and subversively creative.","78","4729990"
"14440","The spirited interplay between Goodman and Crystal is both wacky and, dare I say, charming.","78","198781"
"14441","This film is an example of a Western that ought to appeal to a healthy-sized contemporary audience, and is also a remake of the 1957 film of the same name, which is a hallmark of the type of psychological Western.","78","381849"
"14442","Molly Ringwald is radiant here as the eternal teen looking for love.","78","88128"
"14443","This is provocative stuff, to be sure, in which the stakes are so high that a pratfall concludes with exploding limbs and the anguished effect of its final minutes is a quiet shock to the system. A comedy of errors and terrors? Who woulda thunk it?","78","1341167"

"14452","Taken moves so fast and with such single-minded, vindictive energy, there's no time for moral ambivalence.","78","936501"
"14453","Filmed primarily in desaturated colors and oblique shadows, the look of J. Edgar is spot-on. The time frame jumps around, spanning decades in a single leap, but it doesn't strain the structure. Eastwood and DiCaprio have delivered a nuanced story about a man, a mythos, and an institution that relies on the facts rather than the legend.","78","1616195"
"14454","Mostly this is a tense, portentous, and provocative piece.","78","1423995"
"14455","Although the film tends to suffer from a severe case of overt preachiness in the third reel (shades of James Cameron's ""The Abyss""), it's still a wonderfully visual, exciting ride.","78","119116"
"14456","It's not perfect - infrequently the comedy and drama rub up against each other too much - but it is the genuine article: a wholly unique family film that can moisten your eyes even while it quickens your pulse.","78","327137"
"14457","Serenity evinces the kind of swashbuckling bonhomie that made so many of us fall in love with the original ""Star Wars"" films, a love that was mightily tested by George Lucas' humorless prequels.","78","379786"
"14458","Overall, The Lobster packs a wicked punch, eviscerating modern romance in surprising and evocative ways.","78","3464902"
"14459","A razor-wire-taut (and extremely violent) exploration of what happens when good guys go bad, badder, baddest.","78","139654"
"14460","It's a film that you can take home and chew over later, both abrasive in its loudness and reflective in its fleeting, feminine moments of silence. Well done.","78","259711"
"14461","The film's greatest strength undeniably lies in Gosling's revelatory portrayal of Danny.","78","247199"
"14462","American Animals is as much an exercise in objective truth – or the lack thereof – as it is the retelling of a single series of events.","78","6212478"

"14464","A romantic screwball comedy, one is as intoxicated by words, dialogue and characters as by love.","78","109831"
"14465","The film is a sharp and keenly etched study of a man who would be the sidekick to kings.","78","4191702"
"14466","Hacksaw Ridge is drenched in the blood of the fallen and the mud forever caked on the boots of those who survived to tell the tale. It’s the closest thing to feeling as though you’ve marched a mile in those shoes.","78","2119532"
"14467","Knockout ensemble performances like these don't come around all that often, though, and when they do they ought to be savored.","78","114478"
"14468","Out of a terrific ensemble cast, Pugh (Midsommar, TV’s The Little Drummer Girl) emerges as the star.","78","3281548"
"14469","Helgeland's film positively seethes with bad vibrations; it's kicky, nasty urban sangfroid with pointy little teeth and a serious case of the angries, an existential hand grenade disguised as a heist film.","78","120784"
"14470","Along the way, you’ll wonder if you’re watching a classic tragedy or a comedy.","78","5715874"
"14471","It's all fab, baby, a kicky, wiggy sequel that scores on all levels, from the sexy to the sublime.","78","145660"
"14472","This new Man from U.N.C.L.E. would be an instant masterpiece if it were consistently as good as its best parts, but even as a hit-and-miss affair, it’s a bracing bit of late-summer fun for anyone who has given up the notion of a major studio offering anything truly revelatory until at least October.","78","1638355"
"14473","At times, it looks as though Broken Embraces might be the love child of Douglas Sirk and Alfred Hitchcock, with its dramatic broad strokes, iconic reds, and teasing narrative clues.","78","913425"
"14474","This film is sweet and frequently very funny. It isn’t perfect. Some of those imperfections – or, more to the point, irritants, such as the twee chapter headings and college-essay framing device – are carryovers from the YA novel, written by Jesse Andrews, who also adapted the novel to screen.","78","2582496"
"14475","The Last of the Mohicans rarely flinches in depicting the eye-for-an-eye savagery of war. Although not explicit in the way you might expect, it nevertheless requires you to screw your courage to the sticking place. Perhaps that's a tribute to its ability to take you along its journey without much effort – real enough to elicit a visceral reaction, romantic enough to remind you it's only a movie.","78","104691"
"14476","All told, The Young Victoria is a very well-made if not especially memorable picture, moving with all the grace and steadfastness of a waltz Victoria and Albert share, but absent any urgency or anything particularly exclamatory.","78","962736"
"14477","A humanistic adventure film that's both rich with characterization and concussive cannon bursts, Master and Commander is, surprisingly, some of the best work either Crowe or Weir have ever done.","78","311113"
"14478","A wellspring of lowbrow comedy that leaves you giggling in spite of yourself. Truly, it does not suck.","78","115641"
"14479","Moneyball is a smart, funny, and thoughtful baseball movie.","78","1210166"
"14480","It's not nearly as complex and eerily existential as the director's debut, ""Moon,"" but in its own way it's an even more satisfying time slice of identity-scrambled sci-fi.","78","945513"
"14481","There are good guys we don't care much about and bad guys that we do and even badder guys we're supposed to hate. But on the sliding scale of culpability, everybody's just a few clicks away from the next guy.","78","840361"
"14482","The one element of “Pitch Perfect” that this new film can’t provide is surprise; if you’re willing to forfeit discovery in favor of some breezy déjà vu, however, Pitch Perfect 2 is totally playing your song.","79","2848292"
"14483","Melissa McCarthy gives one of her best performances in a surprisingly relatable story about a criminal misanthrope with a heart beating deep inside her.","79","4595882"
"14484","With nary a jump scare in sight, Aster has created a moody piece with a delicate but devastating sense of dread.","79","7784604"
"14485","Occupies an odd middle ground between their Apatow-produced bromances, the giddy gruesomeness of the recent “Aftershock” and the confined social abrasiveness of “It’s a Disaster.”","79","1245492"
"14486","Wonder Woman is leaps and bounds above the other three entries in the DCEU. With a dramatic setting, a few entertaining action scenes, and a strong supporting cast all working together to tell an inspirational Hero’s Journey, it more than offsets some occasionally uneven acting on Gadot’s part and some shaky technical aspects.","79","451279"
"14487","The film has enough charm and humor to keep it appealing to a wide audience, and dumbing things down doesn’t feel particularly smart or canny, and proves to be a minor distraction to an otherwise majorly entertaining feature.","79","2582846"
"14488","On the whole After the Wedding is a touching journey through a world where even those with the best intentions leave some wreckage behind, and where forward motion only comes with hard looks into the past.","79","7985692"
"14489","It may not be Coppola’s most thought-provoking or emotional outing to date, but it’s a chilling and stunningly well-made one nonetheless.","79","5592248"
"14490","The 2018 Halloween isn’t an entirely successful film, and it won’t provide an easy template for a new generation of revitalized slasher flicks. But it does serve as a fitting coda to a story that began 40 years ago.","79","1502407"
"14491","The Greatest Showman is wildly entertaining even when it’s spectacularly false, which is a lot of the time. But everyone is enjoying themselves on-screen, so you might as well enjoy yourself too.","79","1485796"
"14492","There’s charm and delight here, to be sure, but it is occasionally obscured by attempts to make it somehow darker, deeper, and more dramatic.","79","2140373"
"14493","Eminem does not come off as a megalomaniac in 8 Mile, but he expects people to be very, very impressed. I doubt he could lend himself to a fiction that said anything else: his eyes couldn't tell any story but his own. [11 November 2002, p. 195]","80","298203"
"14494","Whatever the news-linked reasons for its revival, Pontecorvo's film is wonderfully worth seeing, or re-seeing, for its own sake.","80","58946"
"14495","The achievement of John Carter is that it takes the elements worn to nubs by everything from ""Star Wars"" to ""Avatar"" to TV's ""Fringe"" and makes them fresh again.","80","401729"
"14496","Wilder’s supreme skill at balancing light with dark is almost unsurpassed, and is the perfect fit for the chameleon-like talents of both Lemmon and MacLaine.","80","53604"
"14497","The cinematic equivalent of a disposable airplane read, a hokey, kinky military thriller that's twisty and compelling enough to hook viewers in the mood for a trashy good time.","80","144214"
"14498","Into the Spider-Verse really is the ultimate Spider-Man film in a lot of ways, the one that crystallizes the character’s moral philosophy, his life lessons, his arachnid athleticism, and his quirky sense of humor into one hugely appealing package. It’s pure dorky fun.","80","4633694"
"14499","Eastwood's latest picture boasts tight storytelling, sharp acting and an eye for unexpected, enlivening detail.","80","139668"
"14500","The title almost suggests manhood as something trifling. The film, however, confirms it's a mighty hard ideal to reach.","80","58414"
"14501","The most underestimated commercial movie of 1987 may not be quite as good as Elaine May's three previous features, but it's still a very funny work by one of this country's greatest comic talents.","80","93278"
"14502","Featuring a pair of terrific performances by Viggo Mortensen as a goombah with a heart of gold and Mahershala Ali as multilingual composer-musician Don Shirley, the story may be unique, yet it goes pretty much exactly the way you might expect.","80","6966692"
"14503","It’s unpredictable and a bit of a mess. And that’s what makes Maggie’s Plan such a delight.","80","3471098"
"14504","The situations might be formulaic, but the teamwork of the two leads brings them to sparkling life.","80","1041829"
"14505","TS3, like its predecessors, is a clever, engrossing adventure.","80","435761"
"14506","The simple story is enlivened by an intelligent, compassionate screenplay, whose sole deficiency is that it makes no attempt to represent the management point of view. Field's performance is flawless.","80","79638"
"14507","Yes, this important film will deepen a debate about the game's safety. And, yes, it makes the National Football League look like a tobacco company run by the Nixon administration. But immigration is the ultimate political football right now — and when I left the theater, it was with a renewed sense of what one dignified man can achieve when given a chance in a great nation.","80","3322364"
"14508","The director of quirky fare with a rabid cult-like following has made a charming, magical and really funny new work about two unique young kids discovering love over one unforgettable summer, and it's the director's most accessible movie yet.","80","1748122"
"14509","All The Money In The World is not perfect; there is a touch of naïveté and stereotyping in its depiction of the malign Italians with their one, redemptive nice-guy gangster. But with the help of Plummer’s tremendous villain-autocrat performance, Ridley Scott gives us a very entertaining parable about money and what it can’t buy.","80","5294550"
"14510","Skyfall is pretty much all you could want from a 21st Century Bond: cool but not camp, respectful of tradition but up to the moment, serious in its thrills and relatively complex in its characters but with the sense of fun that hasn't always been evident lately.","80","1074638"
"14511","Extract seems destined to do minor business at the box office but achieve a kind of immortality as a cult DVD, to be quoted from at parties and passed around to friends. Which may be just fine by its creator--as Beavis and Butt-head have taught us, snickering with your friends in front of the television can is one of life's great joys.","80","1225822"
"14512","Beetlejuice springs to life when the raucous and repulsive Betelgeuse (Keaton) rises from his moribund state to wreak havoc on fellow spooks and mortal enemies.","80","94721"
"14513","This exuberant Western is a crowd-pleaser that remains faithful to the genre while having a roaring good time sending up its conventions.","80","110478"
"14514","With disarmingly entertaining movies like this, dare I say, who needs big bad superhero movies?","80","145487"
"14515","Far less cuddly than expected, this unusual and elegant movie may have failed to connect with US audiences but it proves Spielberg is currently the most unpredictable director in Hollywood.","80","362227"
"14516","So drippy and slippery you'll feel that you're hiding in Kevin Costner's nasal passages during the filming of ""Waterworld.""","80","118583"
"14517","This is a film of shifting moods and occasionally contradictory narratives. It’s as much about delusion as it is about gentrification, and as much about friendship as it is about solitude.","80","4353250"
"14518","With warm humor and perceptive writing, director Kenneth Lonergan displays a gift for creating realistic characters and a compelling story.","80","203230"
"14519","Though shot in four weeks on a low budget, Stephen King's Children of the Corn, while not on a par with ""Carrie,"" sure beats ""Christine,"" ""Cujo"" and ""Dead Zone."" It's terse, tense and the sound is effective as auditory terror.","80","87050"
"14520","There is something compelling about someone who simply shows up for the job, day after day, carving out the remarkable from the unremarkable.","80","3263904"
"14521","With the whole of America as his backdrop, Penn pulls off his most ambitious movie yet. The result is a beautiful and thought-provoking road movie.","80","758758"
"14522","[Murray] has the natural actor's charm of making manners matter. He carries Groundhog Day with his uniquely frittery nonchalance and makes the movie a comic time warp anyone should be happy to get stuck in. [15 Feb 1993, p.63]","80","107048"
"14523","A giggly cocktail, though it's more foam than drink.","80","126029"
"14524","Action dwells upon the misadventures of the pair as they pursue the outlaw trail, but more importantly, packs the type of fast movement the title indicates.","80","64115"
"14525","A museum piece, something to be enjoyed for its historical value. [2000 re-release]","80","70047"
"14526","Among the movie's strengths are the performances, especially that of Ryder, who comes across as bright, beautiful and more delicate than ever before. The lead roles in this film are the sorts of roles that she and Hawke really ought to be playing ones that allow their contemporary vibes to work for them. The film's shortcomings are those of youth and with one exception they are easily forgiven.","80","110950"
"14527","Visceral, witty and appropriately redundant, the sequel has a winning commercial recipe that's certain to cook up excellent returns in all areas.","80","120082"
"14528","Has a great look and an edgy feel, along with some broad swaths of humor.","80","165929"
"14529","With Half-Blood Prince, again we have a stalwart, satisfying visualization of the Rowling cosmos.","80","417741"
"14530","Not just one of the best ""comic book"" movies ever made, but also one of the best films of the year.","80","372784"
"14531","This spiral of self-imposed despair feels like part three of a trilogy of American financial darkness after Killing Them Softly and The Counsellor. The Gambler isn’t quite so audience-unfriendly, but those looking for a typical Wahlberg thriller might come away disappointed. Others looking for a less sure bet might reap the rewards.","80","2039393"
"14532","One of the best kid's films of the year, full of delight and action and charm and comedy.","80","1446192"
"14533","And while this director's cut doesn't really differ all that much from the original 1979 release, it contains a few minutes of never-before seen footage, including one serious bitch slap and an entire scene in which Ripley stumbles upon a few not-quite-dead crew members whose terrible fates foreshadow James Cameron's 1986 sequel.","80","78748"
"14534","By far the most rousing, expertly cast movie this year, David O. Russell's movie takes a roundabout way of telling its true story.","80","964517"
"14535","Pacific Rim is big and dumb in a smart way.","80","1663662"
"14536","It takes a while for this oddball film -- a mosaic of stories in the style of ""Magnolia"" -- to take hold, but when it does, it grabs you hard.","80","268690"
"14537","Writer-director Levinson returns to Baltimore (his home town) with a perceptive, rueful comedy called Tin Men. It is about male camaraderie and revenge, and it, too, uses its setting as a statement. Baltimore, circa 1963, represents hope, transition and a fading American Dream. [13 Mar 1987, p.1D]","80","94155"
"14538","Yes, Del Toro’s latest flight of fancy sets out to liberally pastiche the postwar monster movie, doffing its cap to the incident at Roswell and all manner of related cold war paranoia. But it’s warmer and richer than the films that came before. Beneath that glossy, scaly surface is a beating heart.","80","5580390"
"14539","Grief may be the topic under examination, but humor -- incisive, observant and warm -- is the tool with which it's dissected in Rabbit Hole, a refreshingly positive-minded take on cinema's ultimate downer: overcoming the death of a child.","80","935075"
"14540","Inventive suspense, spiky characters, outrageous horror and wicked satire. Welcome back, George - you've been away too long.","80","418819"
"14541","A low-budget winner--a romantic fable about a Philadelphia palooka who gains his manhood, written by and starring muscle-bound Sylvester Stallone, who is repulsive one moment, noble the next. He's amazing to watch.","80","75148"
"14542","It’s a beautifully animated tale (keep your eyes on the way Kubo’s hair moves) that balances story with comedy and moments of effective (if light) horror.","80","4302938"
"14543","A tantalizing spine-tingler.","80","230600"
"14544","The miraculous surprise is that Horrible Bosses 2 isn't terrible at all. It's looser, breezier, more confident than its predecessor.","80","2170439"
"14545","Writer-director M. Night Shyamalan lets the tension rise slowly, leads you everywhere you don't expect, doesn't rip you off and totally freaks you out -- all without stale effects or gore.","80","167404"
"14546","Lawrence is gritty, real and totally genuine. And, after ‘Brooklyn’ and ‘Carol’, here’s another film that passes the Bechdel Test for proper female characters with flying colours.","80","2446980"
"14547","Let Me In eclipses ""Twilight"" in every way, leaving you thirsty for more of this haunting, touching and unforgettable thriller.","80","1228987"
"14548","Of sentiment there is too much and the final sequence when the white men inevitably rear their heads and raise their rifles so fraught with tears and peril as to be exhaustingly melodramatic.","80","99348"
"14549","Director Joe Johnston, a veteran of Industrial Light and Magic, brings a wry Rube Goldberg approach to his first-ever feature. The sets are definitely plastic, but that slightly homemade look is refreshing in the hardware movie decade.","80","97523"
"14550","Martin Scorsese's intrusive insistence on his abstract, metaphysical theme—the possibility of modern sainthood—marks this 1973 film, his first to attract critical notice, as still somewhat immature, yet the acting and editing have such an original, tumultuous force that the picture is completely gripping.","80","70379"
"14551","With its sophisticated psychology, its brilliant story structure and its riveting performances, The Duchess of Langeais feels very new, even if everything about it is old.","80","781435"
"14552","The closest thing Gray's done to a commercial actioner, the film also applies his genius for tone (aided by superlative sound work) to set pieces that throb with trauma: a tinnitus-soundtracked shoot-out and a rain-slick car chase set to the tempo of windshield wipers.","80","498399"
"14553","Even the flaws mesh with the overall fabric of the film in a way that impeccably choreographed musical numbers and fight scenes might not have. Altman reverses the emphasis of most mainstream family entertainments, which are about pace and snap, and instead favors a gentle, more inviting evocation of Sweethaven and its oddball inhabitants. Robert Evans wanted an answer to the Broadway hit Annie. Instead, he got a Robert Altman film.","80","81353"
"14554","Fast-moving, exciting and contains more twists than a tunnel under Checkpoint Charlie.","80","944835"
"14555","Cooler cars and more action follow Lightning and Mater as they mix it up with spies and Formula 1 racers in yet another Pixar winner.","80","1216475"
"14556","How refreshing it is to see a studio picture where plot development is revealed not so much by grandiose action as by the small, interior shifts that are witnessed through a character's eyes.","80","140397"
"14557","A visually stunning Swiftian satire, Children Of Men may appear clumsy, but its message is simple, heartfelt and ultimately rather moving.","80","206634"
"14558","It's no wonder young musicians say they learned to be rock stars from This Is Spinal Tap. It came to satirize and stayed -- and stays on -- to celebrate.","80","88258"
"14559","Fabulously acted and written with zing and zong, it's one of the few enjoyable movies of the summer.","80","89886"
"14560","Louis Sachar's compelling children's classic is about as Disney as Freddy Krueger. It's got murder, racism, facial disfigurement and killer lizards.","80","311289"
"14561","Perhaps it's no surprise that Reitman has come out with a lovely Hollywood romance that floats buoyantly along on a sea of sadness.","80","1193138"
"14562","Touching and wise, with fine performances and impeccable widescreen photography, The Rookie is a rare family film that encourages kids to pursue their dreams, but not before giving full weight to the consequences.","80","265662"
"14563","It is a wonderfully wacko work, sparked with Cook's oomph, Dunaway's cackle and the superstar power of the sensational Slater. What a face! As long as people prevail over effects, Supergirl glitters, she glows. [23 Nov 1984, p.27]","80","88206"
"14564","With Natalie Portman dominating the action and exhibiting a screen maturity not seen from her before, this all-stops-out Grand Guignol melodrama exhibits more than enough blood, sweat and tears (emphasis on the blood) to score nicely beyond the ballet crowd.","80","947798"
"14565","Daniels is that rare contemporary filmmaker who's not afraid of melodrama. The Butler is so old-school it feels modern: Stylistically, it could have been made 30 years ago, but its time is now.","80","1327773"
"14566","Although Cleavon Little and Gene Wilder head a uniformly competent cast, pic is handily stolen by Harvey Korman and Madeline Kahn. Kahn is simply terrific doing a Marlene Dietrich lampoon...Rest of cast is fine, although Little’s black sheriff doesn’t blend too well with Brooks’ Jewish-flavored comic style. Wilder is amusingly low-key in a relatively small role.","80","71230"
"14567","If the destination ultimately proves a little less satisfying than the trip, Mitchell and his collaborators fill us with so many moody reveries that we succumb to its warped logic and indelible vividness.","80","5691670"
"14568","Apatow’s richest, most complicated movie yet--a summing up of his feelings about comedy and its relation to the rest of existence.","80","1201167"
"14569","A B-movie-style throwback that’s consistently diverting and blissfully free of morals and messages, A Perfect Getaway is just the thing for the summertime movie blahs: it’s a genuinely satisfying cheap thrill.","80","971209"
"14570","Like most daydreams, The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty is funny, sad, weird and corny all at once – and you’ll probably only remember the good bits as soon as it’s finished. But it’s still a lot better than real life.","80","359950"
"14571","A fine cast, speedy pacing and playful direction make this a solid contender for the Austen sweepstakes.","80","116191"
"14572","The Distinguished Gentleman is an easy, breezy romp of a movie, a low comedy of highly entertaining order.","80","104114"
"14573","Writer-director Carl Franklin's cool, expert adaptation of Devil in a Blue Dress, Mosley's first novel, evokes the spirit of '40s film noir more effectively than any movie since Chinatown.","80","112857"
"14574","So innately compelling is Turing’s story — to say nothing of Benedict Cumberbatch’s masterful performance — it’s hard not to get caught up in this well-told tale and its skillful manipulations.","80","2084970"
"14575","With Alfred Hitchcock pulling the suspense strings, The Man Who Knew Too Much is a good thriller.","80","49470"
"14576","It's not an easy sit; we're never let off the hook with golden-hued memories or belated bits of wisdom. Maybe this is love after all.","80","1602620"
"14577","What it offers isn't really a nostalgic look at a ""more innocent time"" so much as a saucy wink at a casually vicious time that is constantly being sold to us as innocent.","80","427327"
"14578","Not a lot to it, but the sense of period is acute, the script witty without falling into the crude pitfalls that beset other adolescent comedies, and the performances are spot-on.","80","83833"
"14579","The movie is full of inspired touches as well as excessive ones: its appeal lies in the way its humor always treads the line between sendup and campy overkill.","80","120888"
"14580","Stallone is feral this film, physically powerful; he's muddy and bloody, but he's still pretty even in a tarpaulin. He's the wild child coming home. First Blood is good to the last drop, if you like that sort of thing. [22 Oct 1982, p.17]","80","83944"
"14581","An engaging, family-oriented romantic comedy that should appeal as much to fans of the original movie as to viewers unfamiliar with the 1961 Hayley Mills version.","80","120783"
"14582","Nobody else working in movies today can make her (Keaton) own misery such a source of delight or make the spectacle of utter embarrassment look like a higher form of dignity.","80","337741"
"14583","A sturdily entertaining vehicle, easily the little guy's best American-made film.","80","120812"
"14584","The two most hilarious characters, played by Spain's two most famous actors, Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz, are nothing if not cliches about tempestuous Latin lovers. But, boy, does Allen have fun with those cliches.","80","497465"
"14585","A stunner of unrelenting tension interrupted by action, violence and gore.","80","91209"
"14586","A seamless, pulsating, dazzlingly visual revenge fantasy that stands as one of the most effective live-actioners ever derived from a comic strip.","80","109506"
"14587","It doesn’t seem new for them, yet as super polished, mannered, slightly surreal comedies go, the movie feels as rare as a unicorn.","80","475290"
"14588","A hugely successful slam-bang thriller that zaps the audience with noise, speed, and brutality. It's certainly exciting, bu that excitement isn't necessarily a pleasure. The ominous music keeps tightening the screws and heating things up; the movie is like an aggravated case of New York.","80","67116"
"14589","While Hidden Figures hits many of the beats one would expect, Melfi’s film strikes a delicate balance of injecting levity within the character-based historical drama that propels the story forward.","80","4846340"
"14590","Dressed to Kill is a witty blend of suspense and humor, a skillful manipulation of basic nightmare ingredients that leaves one limp, amused and always impressed. It's an achievement particularly noteworthy in contrast to the Grade-Z ""horror"" movies that have been cluttering up the screens lately. [25 July 1980, p.17]","80","80661"
"14591","The sort of massive vanity piece that would be easy to disparage if it didn't essentially deliver.","80","112573"
"14592","It's a nice, if undemanding, Yuletide treat.","80","47673"
"14593","Schindler's List, despite blatant compromises, is a rending historical document. But the film's near-certain victory is based less on merit than on the marketing of its ambitious intentions. The academy doesn't judge movies, it weighs them by subject matter. On that basis, Spielberg's epic tips the scales.","80","108052"
"14594","First-time feature directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor play with speed and sound to effectively recreate the buzz of an over-caffeinated all-nighter, delivering one of the year’s best pure junk-food entertainments.","80","479884"
"14595","Craig Gillespie’s take on Tonya’s story, the hilarious and gut-punching I, Tonya, is a nearly pitch-perfect black comedy that distills the sensational story into two potent insights very relevant to 2017. It’s a movie about class, and it’s a movie about the nature of truth. And somehow it’s also a supremely entertaining sports movie.","80","5580036"
"14596","Rather than milking the outre premise for broad comedy, everyone involved strives to keep the characters and situations grounded and warm.","80","5805752"
"14597","The lovely and poignant drama The Artist and the Model stirringly presents art, life and death as one irrevocably tangled trio.","80","1990217"
"14598","What makes Forte so funny is that he stalks through the flick cocksure and utterly deadpan.","80","1470023"
"14599","The director and screenwriter downplay the conventional melodrama inherent in the situation in favor of emphasizing how practical problems should be addressed with rational responses rather than hysteria, knee-jerk patriotism or selfish expedience.","80","3659388"
"14600","With an edgy, intelligent script by playwright Tom Stoppard, Mr. Spielberg has made an extraordinary film out of Mr. Ballard's extraordinary war experience. [09 Dec 1987]","80","92965"
"14601","At two hours, the film version is a third the miniseries' length, requiring severe compression by screenwriters Peter Straughan (The Debt) and Bridget O'Connor, which they've accomplished smartly.","80","1340800"
"14602","Takes us inside the consciousness and the coded masculine world of a single character.","80","181984"
"14603","These kickass Barbies bring heart to a machine tooled genre.","80","160127"
"14604","Long and winding though it may be, Road to Perdition gets to places that are well worth the trip.","80","257044"
"14605","It has crooks, bats, cobwebs, skeletons, a lovable monster, an underground grotto and a treasure hidden by some of the most considerate, clue-loving pirates who ever lived. Their ghostly ship is the movie's piece de resistance.","80","89218"
"14606","They do make ’em like they used to -- a fresh blast of old-school sci-fi, bursting with ideas and a stellar turn from Rockwell.","80","1182345"
"14607","Kevin Smith's comic-religious fantasy turns out to be the sweetest hot-potato movie imaginable.","80","120655"
"14608","It is thrilling to look at, and that's more than one can say for the majority of pictures out there.","80","162661"
"14609","A socko science-fiction feature, as fearsome as a film as was the Orson Welles 1938 radio interpretation of the H.G. Wells novel.","80","46534"
"14610","Carnivorous lunar activities rarely come any more entertaining than this.","80","82010"
"14611","A somewhat shaggy, frequently hilarious romantic comedy that, like much of Apatow’s best work, delicately balances irreverent raunch with candid insights into the give-and-take of grown-up relationships.","80","3152624"
"14612","Puts the Bond film series (this one makes number 19)-- back on track by stressing the fundamentals and applying a bit of authentic drama for a change.","80","143145"
"14613","The movie, as a whole, isn't nearly so original. Still, it's a pleasing, well-crafted, surprisingly satisfying diversion. It's eager to entertain and has a quality that's genuinely rare these days, a spirit of gentle modesty.","80","101862"
"14614","Quite possibly Clooney’s best effort to date.","80","465538"
"14615","It’s a movie that reels the audience in and keeps it hooked: with smart little kicks of surprise.","80","491175"
"14616","The original was about social manipulation as blood sport. Amazing how easily it transports, themes intact, to our blighted decade, and to our children.","80","139134"
"14617","With its charming performances, bubble-gum colors, and intentionally funny product placements, the movie is like a kiss in a candy store—silly and sweet.","80","112697"
"14618","It features as ghastly a group of interstellar pirates, the Klingons, as ever entered the star log, plus a spectacularly self-destructive planet and plenty of technically adroit and sometimes witty special effects. These are classic directorial occasions, and Nimoy rises to them with fervor, in effect beaming his film up onto a higher pictorial plane than either of its predecessors.","80","88170"
"14619","There’s no tidy moral to take away, because a story like this shouldn’t end in comfort. Instead, your skin’s left prickling by its deft deconstruction of the business of secret-keeping, and its perceptive setting out of the courage and diligence it takes to overturn it.","80","1895587"
"14620","There’s enough dark humour to entertain.","80","340855"
"14621","This clever thriller has the juiced-up, hyperactive feel of a rock video. [07 Mar 1995]","80","111149"
"14622","This gripping character study becomes more agonisingly suspenseful as it gets closer to an answer that can't be confirmed.","80","443706"
"14623","Given that this holiday film season has come up more than a little short on love and laughter, one can easily forgive Kate & Leopold the slightly excessive lengths and complications to which it goes in search of those rare commodities.","80","35423"
"14624","It must be added that Giant, in spite of its length, seldom seems long – its story is too eventful, its effects too picturesque, and its director too skilful for that even over so long an expanse of time. It may not be a great film but it is certainly an awesome one.","80","49261"
"14625","Acting of this sort is rare in films. It is a display of talent, which one gets in the theater, as well as a demonstration of behavior, which is what movies usually offer. Were Mr. De Niro less an actor, the character would be a sideshow freak.","80","75314"
"14626","Lemmon is superior as a man facing up to issues he never wanted to confront personally. Edgy and belligerent most of the time, Spacek is more constrained but she's fully believable.","80","84335"
"14627","It's one hell of a ride and a real, roaring rock movie. [01 Mar 1991]","80","101761"
"14628","The Prestige traces the course of their bitter feud, as their respective acts of sabotage become ever more deadly.","80","482571"
"14629","This is Holofcener’s sweet spot, the depiction of the emotional confusions, self-deceptions, uncertainties and misguided decisions that can cloud and get the better of otherwise bright, aware people, especially the female characters she tends to specialize in.","80","2390361"
"14630","Testament to the emergence of a visually masterful filmmaker, capable of ingenious, low-tech special effects.","80","66434"
"14631","Not all the plot developments ring true, but moments carry a real chill - even in a coma, McKellen can terrify a fellow patient almost to death - and it has more than enough thought-provoking material to command your interest.","80","118636"
"14632","The sheer likability of these lived-in characters is a powerful magnet, thanks to insightful writing and a note-perfect ensemble anchored by a never-better Annette Bening.","80","4385888"
"14633","An exciting caper, though sometimes a trying one, with great dollops of self-parodying dialogue that will test your loyalty to Mr. Mamet's way with words.","80","252503"
"14634","Simone is a funny, smart, improbably successful satire on contemporary celebrity obsessions, the waning summer's most delirious comedy.","80","258153"
"14635","Milk thoroughly deserves all of the press ink that will doubtless be spilt over it. Wear your 'Vote Penn' Oscar pin with pride.","80","1013753"
"14636","Beam yourselves aboard Sunshine, set 50 years in the future. The voyage works, beautifully.","80","448134"
"14637","The boldest of Burton's creatures is bogyman Oogie Boogie (Ken Page), a burlap sack of vermin who terrorizes Santa (Ed Ivory). His big boogie-woogie number - a day-glo dance of death called ''Oogie Boogie's Song'' - is so horrifyingly grand that it threatens to steal the show from even the cleverly phantasmagorial ''This Is Halloween'' and the darkly bright (yes, I know that sounds impossible) ''What's This?,'' which pop up early in the film.","80","107688"
"14638","A lean and suspenseful genre piece that follows a bloody trail of vengeance to its cruel, absurd and logical conclusion.","80","2359024"
"14639","In anchoring the whimsy to something more heartfelt, Burton is greatly aided by Billy Crudup, who underplays potentially cringeworthy bedside scenes with his dying dad.","80","319061"
"14640","This is not a movie that wraps up its story in a tidy bow, but it's a lot more fun than most of the ones that do.","80","265666"
"14641","A straightforward camping-holiday nightmare, or a sly, ironic take on the same. It works deliciously as both.","80","139414"
"14642","Except for the political implications of the addition of Freeman's character (which he brings off gracefully) and some revisionism about the nobility of the crusades (which, in my opinion, is long overdue), Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves is just an adventure movie - which is basically what I like about it. The second half is stronger than the first because it's swifter and more action-packed. Robin's feats of derring-do are always (as Costner might put it) neat - the more improbable, the better.","80","102798"
"14643","Despite its gentility and evasiveness, Julia may have come much closer to the truth about Lillian Hellman on the strength of Jane Fonda's edgy, persuasive performance, which reveals an intelligent woman who couldn't feel more unsuree of herself or less like a conquering heroine.","80","76245"
"14644","The truest and most tearduct-tugging relationship here is that between Conor and his lank-haired college-dropout brother, played with spaced-out warmth and wistful good humor by the ever-likeable Reynor.","80","3544112"
"14645","The enthusiastic Zucker, Zucker & Abrahams style of movie parody is too rarely seen to prompt much head-shaking about gags that don't work. The entire film is justified by those gags that do succeed, beginning with a pre-credit sequence that is possibly one of the most blithely hilarious six or seven minutes of film stock ever exposed to light.","80","102510"
"14646","The charm -- the midsummer enchantment -- never feels forced; it steals up and wins you. A true romance.","80","112471"
"14647","Szifron does a terrific job of pacing thanks to expert editing (he shares credit with Pablo Barbieri) within each episode and a genuinely subversive sense of humor.","80","3011894"
"14648","Ending is on the conventional side, more so than anything else in the picture , but script by Ann Biderman and David Madsen keeps the tart surprises coming throughout most of the picture with only occasional lapses into red herrings and artificial manipulation.","80","112722"
"14649","Whether Carrey's fans will like it or not, the film is easily his best crafted piece of work to date. [14 June 1996, p.22]","80","115798"
"14650","This is classic Capracorn, with the greatest girl cynic of the 30s, Jean Arthur.","80","31679"
"14651","This is complex, thought-provoking cinema.","80","404203"
"14652","Fast, full-hearted and graced with a beautifully modulated lead turn by Hailee Steinfeld, the movie takes the risk of playing it straight and sincere — and the risk pays off.","80","1878870"
"14653","It’s a marvellous movie about the lies we tell ourselves to stay sane—and the reasons why we might need to tell the truth.","80","5610554"
"14654","If you've got the time, we've got the brew--lite, zany and slightly intoxicating...It's a loosely constructed movie, rough and raw, but good for more than a few laughs. After you blow away the foam and discount the wandering, nonessential storyline, you'll find a playful, punful little film with salutes to Steven Spielberg and other recent favorite filmmakers. Sound good? Then this, bud, is for you.","80","86373"
"14655","A picture that is surely one of the oddest ever made.","80","270288"
"14656","Whatever stumbles there may be, they are offset by moments when For Colored Girls soars.","80","1405500"
"14657","Broader and more accessible than either ""Shaun Of The Dead"" or ""Hot Fuzz,"" Paul is pure Pegg and Frost - clever, cheeky and very, very funny. You'll never look at E. T. in the same way again.","80","1092026"
"14658","If emotional catharsis is what you seek, Stepmom delivers the goods.","80","120686"
"14659","If Fosse's film fails to capture the man or his art completely, it remains a damn good place to start.","80","71746"
"14660","Ultimately, the mock-doc device works because Gyllenhaal and Pena so completely reinvent themselves in-character. Instead of wearing the roles like costumes or uniforms, they let the job seep into their skin, a feat without which ""End of Watch's"" pseudo-reality never would have worked.","80","1855199"
"14661","A most excellent sequel, funnier and livelier than the original.","80","101452"
"14662","This is a lovely film directed with delicacy and taste, profoundly alive to the rhythms of its actors and characters, which gives its superlative British cast of stage and screen legends the time and space they deserve.","80","1441951"
"14663","One big, fat, honking comic book of a sci-fi-martial-arts adventure flick.","80","133093"
"14664","He looks like a truck ran over him, but at 52 he's still ripped enough to get away with the role; in the end the movie is about Rourke's indomitability more than the character's.","80","1125849"
"14665","The Bourne Supremacy builds on and exceeds the original, delivering, quite simply, one of the finest big-budget thrillers in years.","80","372183"
"14666","An entertainingly offbeat blend of 19th-century science fiction and Hope and Crosby Road comedies.","80","120891"
"14667","Although the script has more than its share of short circuits, director John Badham solders the pieces into a terrifically exciting story charged by an irresistible idea: an extra-smart kid can get the world into a whole lot of trouble that it also takes the same extra-smart kid to rescue it from.","80","86567"
"14668","A very clever, stylish story of friendship, loyalty and betrayal.","80","100150"
"14669","Small-town America is portrayed with gentle, affectionate humour.","80","88763"
"14670","If, like Benigni, you were born after World War II, it reassures us that he hasn't forgotten the innate seriousness of his subject matter, and that despite its grimness, he still thinks life is beautiful.","80","118799"
"14671","None of these three characters are tidy, but neither is desire, nor faith, nor love, and Lelio resists every opportunity to make them so.","80","6108178"
"14672","It’s the tangle of workings-out not the easy answer that are the proof of a theorem, and that magnificent, sparkling, insightful chaos abounds here.","80","2333804"
"14673","The Man Who Invented Christmas is a jaunty, amusing patchwork of truths, half-truths and pure fiction that cleverly combine to recount the story of the whirlwind creation of Charles Dickens' famed novella ""A Christmas Carol.""","80","6225520"
"14674","Like that storied novella by Truman Capote from which it stems, it is a completely unbelievable but wholly captivating flight into fancy composed of unequal dollops of comedy, romance, poignancy, funny colloquialisms and Manhattan's swankiest East Side areas captured in the loveliest of colors.","80","54698"
"14675","Tombstone is incredibly entertaining. While not entirely original and not always well executed, it manages to keep your attention for the entire 130-minute duration. And let's face it, Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday is what really sets it apart.","80","108358"
"14676","The quintessence of the buddy cop pic, ""LW4"" is big on action, playful banter and just enough plot to keep our attention from wandering.","80","122151"
"14677","Everything I've ever dreamed of in a crazy comedy. It's close to pure farce, yet its laughs are grounded in loneliness, impotence, self-loathing, and that most discomfiting of vices to dramatize: envy. The action is surreal, the emotions are violently real.","80","120601"
"14678","This is postmodern folk art, a tricky transaction in which the work isn't just a story, it's a genre survey, a homage, a meditation, a parody and, oh yeah, while it's at it, still a pretty good story.","80","271367"
"14679","Anderson has all manner of fun with the tale's whirling, blurring trajectory. His film is like a jubilant spin painting in which the characters have been scattered and splattered to the furthest reaches of the frame.","80","1791528"
"14680","The Accountant is a nifty piece of genre entertainment, its wacky edge and genial tone despite that body count coming as something of a pleasant surprise in a year rife with lumbering, over-amped blockbusters.","80","2140479"
"14681","Beverly Hills Cop finds Eddie Murphy doing what he does best: playing the shrewdest, hippest, fastest-talking underdog in a rich man's world.","80","86960"
"14682","Forbes brings a marvelous warmth and specificity to this story of a mixed-race family struggling to survive, aided considerably by one of Mark Ruffalo’s richest, most appealing performances.","80","1969062"
"14683","The film features a host of fine character portrayals and a compelling climax that compensates for its length.","80","74119"
"14684","To come out of the summer haze and enter the dark (and cool) wonder of Batman Returns is a pleasure not to be denied. Even more than before, this cartoon opera about cloistered personalities bathes exultantly in moody blues, gothic music swirls and a symphony of character tragedy.","80","103776"
"14685","A laugh-in-the-dark funhouse ride that provides nearly two hours of slightly sinister sight gags and Gothic giggles, is creepy, kooky, even altogether ooky enough to satisfy any Addams addict.","80","101272"
"14686","Want to see a master class in acting? Watch Jonathan Pryce and Anthony Hopkins show how it’s done in The Two Popes, a fiercely moving and surprisingly funny provocation that pivots on speculative conversations between the German John Ratzinger, a.k.a. Pope Benedict XVI (Hopkins), and Argentine Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio (Pryce), the future Pope Francis.","80","8404614"
"14687","Poetic, bawdy, contemplative, often side-wrenchingly funny and finally quite touching, this tale about a nerdy garbage man whose life is changed by an egocentric hobo philosopher is flawed only by its length.","80","122529"
"14688","This mind-and-fork-bending sci-fi saga comes from the freaky imaginations of director Josh Trank and screenwriter Max Landis, who've packed their feature debut with smartness.","80","1706593"
"14689","The story, like ""Frankenstein"" and ""Dracula,"" has taken on the significance of a modern folk tale, layered with obvious moralizing and as familiar as personal history.","80","24216"
"14690","The movie's no roller-coaster ride, but there isn't a boring moment either.","80","118887"
"14691","Fury is a good, solid World War II movie, nothing more and nothing less.","80","2713180"
"14692","Barry emerges as an involving and credible portrait of a smart young man with a good deal of growing and learning yet to do.","80","5477566"
"14693","PLANET OF THE APES is a success on many levels, with a witty, intelligent script by Rod Serling and a suitably hot-tempered, athletic performance from Charlton Heston. Roddy McDowall and Kim Hunter are highly effective as a sympathetic ape scientist and doctor, respectively, with John Chambers's superb latex makeup allowing them a full range of expressive facial gestures.","80","63442"
"14694","The Gift delivers the lurid goods as a scary, sexy, twist-a-minute whodunit.","80","219699"
"14695","It is never less than fascinating — and sometimes dazzling — in its ambitions.","80","1959490"
"14696","Less stuffy literary biopic than ever-relevant female-empowerment saga, Colette ranks as one of the great roles for which Keira Knightley will be remembered.","80","5437928"
"14697","Red isn't a great movie, but it's great fun, and if that sounds like damning with faint praise, you take things too seriously.","80","1245526"
"14698","An astonishing movie that keeps you off-balance from the first scene.","80","120188"
"14699","A beautiful entity, near flawless in design, any talk of accolades certainly seems justified.","80","2402927"
"14700","The impact of this sisterhood fable on viewers should be as warm and rapturous as Olaf the snowman’s dream of summer. Child, teen or septuagenarian, you’ll warm to Frozen.","80","2294629"
"14701","It’s got more than its share of disturbing sequences, and a string of brutal murders. It’s also got surprisingly decent special effects for a movie that was surely made on a fraction of the budget of a DC Comics film. And it has a perfectly cast Jackson A. Dunn as Brandon.","80","7752126"
"14702","At first glance, you might mistake What They Had for one of those well-meaning family dramas about what to do when your mom is diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. But that would discount the exceptional accomplishment achieved by debuting director Elizabeth Chomko, enlivening her scrappy script with a cast of actors who truly are as good as it gets. You laugh as much as you cry, which means you believe in the movie’s truth.","80","6662736"
"14703","This nimble, bemused, culturally curious look at the married instigators of the kitschy “big eyes” paintings of the early 1960s exerts an enjoyably eccentric appeal while also painting a troubling picture of male dominance and female submissiveness a half-century ago.","80","1126590"
"14704","Stirring and striking, Hooper's epic musical won't be wanting for awards and plaudits. Danny Cohen's cinematography is stunning and Hathaway's Oscar is guaranteed.","80","1707386"
"14705","A roundly entertaining romantic comedy, Love Actually is still nearly as cloying as it is funny…its cheeky wit, impossibly attractive cast and sure-handed professionalism are beguiling.","80","314331"
"14706","While the words ""instant holiday classic"" might be pushing it, Elf is at the very least a breezily entertaining, perfectly cast family treat.","80","319343"
"14707","Lemmon is demoniacally funny - he really gives in to women's clothes, and begins to think of himself as a sexy girl. Monroe gives perhaps her most characteristic performance, which means that she's both charming and embarrassing.","80","53291"
"14708","His palette here is deep-toned, with bottomless blacks and supersaturated oranges and blues--as if the Walt Disney of ""Pinocchio"" had collaborated with Goya.","80","457430"
"14709","Kay Cannon’s script is even lighter on narrative than its predecessor, but fills any resulting void with a concentrated supply of riotous gags, and a renewed emphasis on the virtues of female collaboration and independence.","80","2848292"
"14710","In short, Haynes is so smart, tolerant, and thoughtful that he has to be saved by his actors. Julianne Moore takes this picture further, perhaps, than anyone can have dreamed. [18 November 2002, p. 104]","80","297884"
"14711","Director Spencer Susser doesn't try to make Hesher anything other than a sociopath - a walking, profanity-spewing id - and to his credit, neither does Gordon-Levitt.","80","1403177"
"14712","Charlize Theron is the hero we need right now: As devilishly self-serving and smooth as Bond, as physically dynamic and stoic as Wick, Lorraine is confidently equipped to join the legacy of great movie action heroes and she doesn’t need your permission to do it.","80","2406566"
"14713","Adapted from Richard Jessup's realistically-written novel, it emerges a tenseful examination of the gambling fraternity.","80","59037"
"14714","Criminally overlooked in the States, this is one of the best horror movies of the last few years.","80","884328"
"14715","One of the best things the highly variable Jane Fonda has ever done.","80","67309"
"14716","The film is very funny – but asks its audience to wonder if being funny, if wanting to make people laugh, and particularly if using comedy for family-bonding, really is the sign of being relaxed and life-affirming in the way people who are talented at comedy often assume.","80","4048272"
"14717","An imaginative and disturbing work; well worth a look.","80","114369"
"14718","An exuberantly crafted chase thriller that pulses with energy from its adrenaline-pumping first minutes to its muted bang of a finish.","80","993842"
"14719","Robert Wise's adaptation of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical still has a little soul in its bones, with its reactionary nature tempered by Ernest Lehman's supple screenplay, and its elephantine running-time eased by a set of songs that lodge in your system like hookworms.","80","59742"
"14720","This is a spy movie bereft of the genre's usual, casual kicks. It's not interested in cheap thrills or playing gotcha with the audience. (Which isn't to say parts of it aren't exhilarating.)","80","401997"
"14721","Welles' third film, often described as his worst, but still a hugely enjoyable thriller.","80","38991"
"14722","One way you know that D.J. Caruso is a resourceful director is that he scares you silly with a minimum of violence and a few smears of blood. His job was certainly made easier by Morse, whose glassy demeanor and high, soft rasp suggests horrors that not even Quentin Tarantino could imagine.","80","486822"
"14723","Watch Mulligan's face as she goes from weary to awakened, and see it all come together.","80","1174732"
"14724","Ultimately, Crazy Rich Asians doesn’t need to subvert all its predictable elements, because even if we know where it’s going, we’ve never seen that story told this way.","80","3104988"
"14725","Crawl is a sensationally thrilling aquatic nightmare filled with carnage, bubbling chaos, and all the creature-feature intensity that makes this the summer's must-see horror event.","80","8364368"
"14726","A lewd, gory, twisty-turny murder mystery swirling around Hollywood's porn industry, Body Double finds Brian De Palma at the zenith of his cinematic virtuosity. The movie has been carefully calculated to offend almost everyone -- and probably will. But, like Hitchcock, De Palma makes the audience's reaction his real subject; Body Double is about the dark longings deep inside us.","80","86984"
"14727","Cabaret is one of those immensely gratifying imperfect works in which from beginning to end you can literally feel a movie coming to life.","80","68327"
"14728","The film’s nervewracking quality is consistent with its content. Nicholson’s performance is a remarkably varied and daring exploration of a complex character, equally convincing in its manic and sober aspects.","80","65724"
"14729","The lines between good and evil are clearly demarcated at the outset and remain more or less fixed as the story progresses, a strategy that in no way compromises the filmmaker’s ability to mine fresh complications and surprises from his story.","80","5311542"
"14730","Major League lacks the subtlety of Bull Durham or the drama of Eight Men Out, but for sheer crowd-pleasing fun it belts one high into the left-field bleachers...Though the plot turns are mostly predictable, they are executed with wit and style.","80","97815"
"14731","If Her is ultimately better at considering the future than it is at taking us there, it resonates as an insightful reminder that love isn’t obsolete quite yet.","80","1798709"
"14732","The movie is by turns a romance, a chick flick, a coming-of-age film and even a stoner movie. There’s something for everyone, with the possible exception of cretins who don’t appreciate great writing, casting, directing and especially acting.","80","3236120"
"14733","It's a literate though strained uplifter.","80","97165"
"14734","More about the myth of Karloff than the monster, this Mel Brooks pastiche is probably his best early film: within limits, it has unity, pace, and even a dramatic interest of sorts.","80","72431"
"14735","There's admirable frankness, intelligence and sensitivity here. Additionally, the film is a thoughtful, funny reflection on the gains and losses of growing old.","80","4270516"
"14736","Existential but also intimate, Ad Astra is a stunning, sensitive exploration of the space left by an absent parent — and the infinite void of actual space.","80","2935510"
"14737","The word for The Changeling is chilling. Medak doesn't pummel the audience with gore and Exorcist-type shock tactics. More than once, he raises real goose bumps using nothing more extraordinary than a bouncing rubber ball. [31 Mar 1980, p.82]","80","80516"
"14738","Director Thomas (once Sgt Lucy Bates of Hill Street Blues) has recreated '70s sitcom-land with the kind of unerring attention to detail Merchant-Ivory lavish on a society ball, and she's drawn hilariously synthetic performances from a shrewdly cloned cast.","80","112572"
"14739","We rarely get to see Sandler do this kind of straight-faced comedy, and he's so good in The Meyerowitz Stories that he deserves the chance to do more.","80","5536736"
"14740","Fluid and lyrical and thoroughly transporting.","80","119223"
"14741","Films exist for different reasons, and the indisputable raison d'etre for About Schmidt is to showcase Jack Nicholson giving a master class in the art of screen acting.","80","257360"
"14742","Mark Ruffalo, in just the right amount of stubble, grease and leather, plays Paul, about as cool an instant dad as a SoCal kid named Laser could hope for.","80","842926"
"14743","There are some plausibility issues in Room, but this is a disturbing and absorbing film, shrewdly acted, particularly by Larson. It lets the audience in; it does not just let the nightmare stun them into submission. You make a real emotional engagement.","80","3170832"
"14744","It’s Jones who really shines. She effortlessly embodies Ruth Bader Ginsburg with such aplomb that when she locks her steely eyes with the camera, you can feel it in your bones that this woman is about to change the world.","80","4669788"
"14745","Roberts has her most galvanic role, and she's sensationally appealing.","80","195685"
"14746","There’s a Spielbergian showmanship to Bayona’s films, wedded to an unabashed emotionalism, and this one reaches for you down in the gut.","80","3416532"
"14747","Goes straight to cult status without quite touching one important base: the audience's emotions. This movie finally isn't anything move than an intricate feat of gamesmanship, but it's still quite something to see. [16 August 1995, p. C15]","80","114814"
"14748","A true nightmare.","80","22913"
"14749","The film represents a retreat from the explicitly political concerns of TO LIVE (which landed the director in serious trouble with P.R.C. authorities), but there's a distinct satirical subtext underlying Zhang's Chinese Gangland, a place of limitless greed, self-destructive ritual and fatal hubris.","80","115012"
"14750","More than just a time-travel rom-com, this is a movie that asks you questions and doesn’t sugar-coat as many of the answers as you’d expect. Smart and sweet, funny and genuinely moving. Should probably come with a ‘there’s something in my eye’ warning.","80","2194499"
"14751","The drawback is that even though The Hurt Locker is extremely effective in places, it ultimately feels unformed and somewhat unfinished.","80","887912"
"14752","In the lead roles, both Robbins and Freeman are outstanding, layering their performances with snippets of individuality: Their small, daily sustenances and minor triumphs are wonderfully inspiring.","80","111161"
"14753","Def and Willis are both good, but Donner's lethal weapon here is Morse, a chronically overlooked character actor whose combined tenderness and ruthlessness make him the most fascinating heavy since Robert Ryan.","80","450232"
"14754","Like a bomb ticking away toward detonation, Glenn Close commands the center of The Wife: still, formidable and impossible to look away from.","80","3750872"
"14755","Abel Ferrara out-sleazes even his own grubby oeuvre with this powerful if overbearing study of a soul swallowed by depravity.","80","103759"
"14756","Nicholson embellishes fascinatingly baroque designs with his twisted features, lavish verbal pirouettes and inspired excursions into the outer limits of psychosis. It's a masterpiece of sinister comic acting.","80","96895"
"14757","A splendidly detailed and rousing caper movie.","80","79240"
"14758","A quiet character study filled with damaged, insular people who live life in small increments, only occasionally exploding in emotion.","80","1278379"
"14759","Six Degrees is magical when addressing the preposterous. Like any good storyteller, Paul is deft at knitting eyes with wool. Smith proves himself an extremely charismatic presence, convincing in his sincerity and cunning in conveying his ability as a human sponge.","80","108149"
"14760","The Perks Of Being A Wallflower is a sweet surprise, a funny, touching terrific and quite wonderful movie that gets it all right about the joys and heartbreaks of growing up circa 1991.","80","1659337"
"14761","A rip-snorting Western, as brashly entertaining as they come.","80","49730"
"14762","The mixture of cartoony stylization and regional realism is completely original--and a testament to the genius eye for color of the great cinematographer Roger Deakins and the designer Dennis Gassner.","80","335245"
"14763","Peter Jackson has not really made a movie of The Lord of the Rings; he has sprung clear of it to forge something new. He has drawn a deep breath, and taken the plunge. [5 January 2004, p. 89]","80","167260"
"14764","This moving story is full of breathtaking compositions, gorgeous spectacle, and inspiring philosophies articulated by sympathetic figures.","80","120102"
"14765","For all the modern gloss, what with poverty and nervous breakdowns it's still highly conventional stuff, but lovingly constructed to produce unremarkable but heart-warming entertainment.","80","80549"
"14766","An all-stops-out rabble-rouser that hurls a broadside at America's medical insurance crisis.","80","251160"
"14767","What's fascinating is how the various issues - religious or practical - are played out in these two quite different families, yet always come down to irreconcilable differences between rebellious women and their stiff-necked, controlling men.","80","1832382"
"14768","Hitchcock breezes through a tongue-in-cheek, nightmarish plot with a lightness of touch that’s equalled by a charming performance from Grant (below), who copes effortlessly with the script’s dash between claustrophobia and intrigue on one hand and romance and comedy on the other.","80","53125"
"14769","Director Ron Howard's deftness in suggesting the subjective experience of Crowe's character, who's later diagnosed with schizophrenia, makes for inspirational narrative.","80","268978"
"14770","The fun in this moody, pounding, overlong, rewarding bring-down of a film is seeing Eddie’s curled lip of contempt, which he flashes at all the suckers, freeze into a rictus when he gets his.","80","54997"
"14771","It is a movie which teeters perpetually on the verge of hallucination, with hideous images and horrible moments looming suddenly through the fog; its movement is largely inward and downward, into a swamp of suppressed abuse memories which are never entirely pieced together or understood – even as the sickeningly violent action continues.","80","5742374"
"14772","Spacious, leisurely, and with elaborate period re-creations of Louisiana in the 30s, this first feature directed by the young screenwriter Walter Hill is unusually effective pulp, perhaps even great pulp.","80","73092"
"14773","If it is indeed possible for a film to be both stylish and tasteless, then A Fish Called Wanda certainly fills the bill.","80","95159"
"14774","Mid90s, for all its darkness, is uplifted by its hilarious moments and joyous skating shots.","80","5613484"
"14775","Hanks gives possibly the most compelling performance of his career.","80","162222"
"14776","Looks like 2004 has given birth to a new superhero franchise after all.","80","317705"
"14777","It will surprise no one who saw the first ''Die Hard'' that the heart and soul of the new film is Bruce Willis, who this time is even better.","80","99423"
"14778","An aching roundelay, a triumphantly benumbed ensemble farce that mingles condescension and compassion in a manner that's disarmingly--and often upsettingly--original.","80","147612"
"14779","Even working within a more conventional framework, Blomkamp again proves to be a superb storyteller. He has a master’s sense of pacing, slowly immersing us into his future world rather than assailing us with nonstop action, and envisioning that world with an architect’s eye for the smallest details.","80","1535108"
"14780","Full credit to Korine, who sustains this act of creative vandalism right through to the finish. Spring Breakers unfolds as a fever dream of teenage kicks, a high-concept heist movie with mescal in the fuel tank.","80","2101441"
"14781","Garden State charms with ease and moves with grace; it's warm but never mushy, languorous but never groggy, rueful but never despondent. It's like a perfect pop song--that thing that makes you smile and tear up at the same time.","80","333766"
"14782","Not only is it highly unusual, but the picture is chock-full of surprise and unexpected humor to leaven its thriller trappings.","80","120890"
"14783","An improbably effective and affecting mix of raw emotions and exciting smackdowns.","80","1291584"
"14784","Full of Anderson’s visual signatures – cameras that swerve, quick zooms, speedy montages – it’s familiar in style, refreshing in tone and one of Anderson’s very best films.","80","2278388"
"14785","The Coens abhor sentimentality, but behind the comic-book grotesqueries there's a disarming sweetness. Like ""Blood Simple,"" this wild-card comedy knows where it's headed every inch of the way. It's a hoot and a half. [16 March 1987, p.73]","80","93822"
"14786","It started a new cycle in screen entertainment by demonstrating that a murder mystery could also be a sophisticated screwball comedy.","80","25878"
"14787","The picture's ending -- which is satisfying, possibly even happy, depending on how you look at it -- is almost inconsequential; it's the texture of everything leading up to it that matters. The Pursuit of Happyness, even within its slickness, gets at intangibles that allegedly grittier movies fail to capture -- like how heavy a wallet can feel when you're down to your last dollar.","80","454921"
"14788","Carrey is not only under control, but funnier than ever.","80","119528"
"14789","The thrill of Hot Fuzz is the chemistry between Nicholas and local oaf Danny Butterman, who is an action film aficionado and finds Nicholas' stories utterly engrossing.","80","425112"
"14790","While the central visual of the figure in the dark goes a long way to provide the essential scares, the success of the film is just as much about what the filmmakers do to develop the characters that the audience cares about.","80","4786282"
"14791","Blanchett’s performance is so dominant in terms of screentime and emotional impact that the film succeeds as not only a virtuoso ensemble piece, but also an unflinchingly intimate study of the character in the title.","80","2334873"
"14792","This film may disappoint some dogmatic Old Hogwartsians: a few plot points have been sacrificed, and Mr. Cuarón does not seem to care much for Quidditch. But it more than compensates for these lapses with its emotional force and visual panache.","80","304141"
"14793","Powerful, sensuous and thematically hokey transsexual adventure.","80","89424"
"14794","Sharp, wildly funny social satire behind the profanity and potty jokes.","80","158983"
"14795","Astonishing as his filmmaking can be at times, it’s Mendes’ attention to character, more than the technique, that makes 1917 one of 2019’s most impressive cinematic achievements.","80","8579674"
"14796","Its intelligence makes it near-essential viewing.","80","405296"
"14797","Writer-director team Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck (It’s Kind of A Funny Story, Half Nelson) must be applauded for refusing to let their shaggy dog tale line up with any predictable storyline.","80","2349144"
"14798","It is a tremendous performance by Jones, who co-wrote the script with her own ex-boyfriend Will McCormick, who appears as a drug-dealing friend with surprisingly grounded advice for just about anything.","80","1405365"
"14799","A smart, stylish horror picture that offers a fresh twist on the ever-reliable revenge theme and affords a raft of talented young actors solid roles that show them to advantage.","80","242998"
"14800","Van Dormael's intriguing script is more than matched in his flamboyant direction of this 2-hour-plus tale, heroically edited by Matyas Veress and Susan Shipton into a fluid, generally understandable narrative.","80","485947"
"14801","A well-observed and deftly performed examination of upper-middle-class emotional deep freeze, The Ice Storm is an intelligent, adult American film.","80","119349"
"14802","Lee's biography of the slain civil rights leader treats Malcolm, not as a political rallying point, but as a fully rounded individual whose life defies reduction to symbolic status.","80","104797"
"14803","The Big Easy is as atmospheric as they come, but -- surprise! -- it's also sharp and swift. Plus, it has ample amounts of chemistry -- the steamy, sexy kind.","80","92654"
"14804","Fashioning ""The Great Dictator"" and ""Inglourious Basterds"" into a cross joint and then lighting it from both ends, Goldberg and Rogen’s second directorial effort follows the hysterically violent misadventures of idiotic talk-show host Dave Skylark (James Franco, hamming it up) and his underachieving producer, Aaron (Rogen).","80","2788710"
"14805","A respectable, intelligent but less than stirring adaptation of an imposingly dense and layered novel.","80","116209"
"14806","Riveting from the word go. The acting is superb, the direction is excellent, and Moroder's score is exhilarating.","80","77928"
"14807","Most crime stories are content to simply exist, wallowing in their own base violence. But David Michôd's fierce debut takes the genre apart, finding a reason for the madness that propels it.","80","1313092"
"14808","Generates enough inspired lunacy to sail past the arid stretches and provide a welcome splash of breezy, at times jaw-droppingly bizarre summer fun.","80","357413"
"14809","The Wayanses can be crude beyond crude, but they're so clever that their inventiveness takes the place of taste.","80","257106"
"14810","Here is an astonishing feat of acting by New Yorker Linda Hunt, cast by Weir because he could not locate a short male actor to fit the bill. A bizarre, yet touching, romantic triangle develops between Gibson, Hunt, and Sigourney Weaver as a British Embassy official.","80","86617"
"14811","It’s part satire, part social comment, all fragmented and downright inconclusive.","80","5960374"
"14812","What keeps the movie going, besides Softley's intelligent direction and Mathieson's inventive cinematography, is the actors' duet between Spacey and Bridges.","80","272152"
"14813","Even with a starry cast, the stirring true story is this drama’s standout feature.","80","2404425"
"14814","The look of the film is amazing. The animation, particularly when the dragons take flight, is seamless.","80","1646971"
"14815","Paul Feig makes a slight gear change for a slick thriller that’s best enjoyed with a martini in hand.","80","7040874"
"14816","Fast, vivd espionage-betrayal thriller, dandy plot. [24 Sep 1975]","80","73802"
"14817","This smart and funny creation is not just wish-fulfilment for the ""Sex And The City"" generation -- it's a Wall Street for the 21st century.","80","458352"
"14818","The outcome is widely known, but the backstory proves boisterously entertaining — and incredibly well-suited to the current climate, as King was both fighting for her gender and exploring her sexuality in 1973, when the widely publicized face-off happened.","80","4622512"
"14819","The fun and frightful Scary Stories to Tell in The Dark will introduce a new generation to the joy of being scared.","80","3387520"
"14820","A salty road trip tinged with sadness, sensitively handled by Linklater and his cast. Unfocused in places, but never less than diverting.","80","6018306"
"14821","Loaded with smart sight gags and endearing secondary characters, it effectively mixes slapstick splatter and deadpan satire...Pretty damned irresistible.","80","138510"
"14822","Shot on 16mm for less than $50,000, Sam Raimi's visceral debut remains a benchmark of modern horror. Plot and acting are minimal - five stooges inadvertently awaken demonic forces - but then this isn't about intellect or intricacy: it's about intensity and intestines. [1 Oct 2001]","80","83907"
"14823","This is all terrifically nasty and shocking stuff.","80","372588"
"14824","Layering his film with the songs that made his subject an icon, Tillman is aware that Biggie connected with his audience because he told stories others instantly understood. Notorious does that, too.","80","472198"
"14825","It’s among the most visually extravagant films ever made.","80","93593"
"14826","The original Ocean's is fun, fun, fun. It was a heist caper that was just an excuse for a bunch of friends (Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., et al) to get together and make whoopee.","80","54135"
"14827","The movie has a lot going for it, including an array of imaginative special effects and Fox's expertly calibrated performance. [19 July 1996, p.17]","80","116365"
"14828","It’s a carnivalesque lark whose brevity and gravity are both attributable to the remarkable, pitch-perfect performance of O’Toole.","80","81568"
"14829","But aside from a few overblown production numbers, Columbus respects the show's smaller scale, and the property itself is a knockout, with great tunes and engaging portraits of East Village bohemians in the AIDS-ravaged late 80s.","80","294870"
"14830","As a well-directed star vehicle with a couple of good action sequences, this is good, effective filmmaking, but I was periodically bored; when Ford and Pitt aren't lighting up the screen nothing much happens.","80","118972"
"14831","This is a movie for anyone who has ever loved baseball and for anyone who enjoys the American Graffiti/Stand by Me style of narrative. Highly recommended.","80","108037"
"14832","More than anything, Munich is a slammin' entertainment filled with dazzling set pieces and geometric camerawork.","80","408306"
"14833","Though its title may promise a clinical procedural, Anatomy of a Murder cloaks itself in smartly tailored ambiguity and irresolution, and never altogether strips off.","80","52561"
"14834","My Cousin Vinny is a hoot.","80","104952"
"14835","Avoiding the 80s staple of angsty adolescence, Crowe has constructed an intelligent, witty yet undeniably cute tale, showing the potential that would be realised in Singles and Jerry Maguire, and giving Cusack's warm-hearted Lloyd the perfect foil in Skye's prissy model of student perfection.","80","98258"
"14836","Baumbach seeks to mine his material for laughs, no matter how desperate the situation becomes.","80","7653254"
"14837","Though slightly marred by a clunky structure and a lack of truly catchy tunes, Nine’s wall-to-wall first-rate performances from its stellar cast (especially Cotillard) add a touch of class.","80","875034"
"14838","Cobb is a refreshingly spiky antidote to Cataclysm all the Hollywood paeans to the suffering glory of the game. Ty Cobb approached baseball as he approached life: take no prisoners and leave scorched earth behind you. His greatness and his monstrosity can't be untangled. Cobb allows us to honor his achievements, but with no false illusions. It puts the ball in our hands: if this is an American hero, we need to figure out why. [12 Dec 1994, p.72]","80","109450"
"14839","An intense, volatile film full of sorrow and wild, mordant humor.","80","163988"
"14840","This brilliantly naive, low-budget shoot-'em-up presents every action as if it were brand spanking new.","80","104815"
"14841","It has a light touch, a disarming cast, a well-developed sense of humor and a lot of charm. [27 Feb 1987, p.C17]","80","94006"
"14842","It is an eccentric and entertaining movie soap-opera.","80","31762"
"14843","Cloaking (Bateman's) world in a hyperrealist light so sharp you could cut yourself on it, Harron keeps the violence minimal, over the top and ghoulishly funny.","80","144084"
"14844","What ultimately saves the film from both silliness and ponderousness is not its simplistic social message, not its now-stale theme, nor its disappointing characterizations, but rather the dazzling cinematic (and theatrical) bag of tricks which Lang and company employed to keep things moving.","80","17136"
"14845","Set in the world of naval fighter pilots, pic has strong visuals and pretty young people in stylish clothes and a non-stop soundtrack.","80","92099"
"14846","Pet Sematary is proficiently tense, dashingly macabre and soaked in nightmarish tones that thrive on audience screams.","80","837563"
"14847","Each scene is enticing, draws you in, and tackles the verbal foreplay from the book nicely.","80","308383"
"14848","It’s Norton’s own performance that brings emotional connection to Motherless Brooklyn. Always a consummate actor, with Oscar nominations for ""Primal Fear,"" ""American History X"" and ""Birdman"" — he deserved another for ""Fight Club"" — Norton is at his very best as Lionel, seeing beyond the tics to the things that make him human.","80","385887"
"14849","Although the movie -- falls occasional prey to pretension, it's a classic guilty pleasure.","80","254099"
"14850","A super-entertaining, super-slick love/hate letter to horror with a final 20 minutes that's stunningly bonkers.","80","1259521"
"14851","The handsomely shot, expertly button-pushing scare-fest has the polish and the cast to draw older audiences who grew up on shockers built from performances rather than CGI.","80","1457767"
"14852","Charming and imaginative.","80","120789"
"14853","The film grabs at historical facts, mangles them into a plot worthy of a John le Carré spy novel and takes the viewer on a breathtaking ride through ye olde London.","80","1521197"
"14854","Downey and Favreau give the movie a quirky flavor it can call its own. For that we can be grateful.","80","371746"
"14855","Flawlessly designed, with the beautiful 3D cinematography contrasting the clean white futurism of Prometheus' interiors with the black corporeal surfaces of the alien catacombs.   It might not pack the unbearable menace or blazing horror of the saga's first two movies, but it utterly eclipses the last two. It's exciting, tense and fully impregnated for sequels.","80","1446714"
"14856","A rollicking adventure through worlds both bleak and fantastic, Steven Spielberg's Ready Player One makes big changes to the specifics and structure of Ernest Cline's best-selling novel but keeps the spirit and level-up thrills intact.","80","1677720"
"14857","A virtually wordless film that speaks with grave eloquence and simplicity about the human condition. Nothing here feels fancy or extraneous, least of all Redford’s superb performance.","80","2017038"
"14858","A triumph for Ramsay anchored by terrific performances. Guaranteed to haunt you for days, and possibly prompt a rethink on your position on parenthood.","80","1242460"
"14859","The result falls somewhere between a slave-escape drama, an action thriller, a western and even an unexpected kind of superhero film. It’s a winning combination, although Lemmons does not immerse us in the agony and injustice of slavery as such; she puts together a well-crafted movie that is the showcase for an excellent performance from Erivo.","80","4648786"
"14860","Impressively, first-time filmmaker and former Google commercials creator Aneesh Chaganty has also made a real movie, the story of a family that morphs into a crime drama that gradually ratchets up the tension as all good thrillers must, one that’s well constructed and acted as well as novel in its storytelling techniques.","80","7668870"
"14861","Quite a spicy brew.","80","120780"
"14862","Gracefully directed by Robert Schwentke, the film has a perfect performance by Bana, rangy and haunted, never at home in his body.","80","452694"
"14863","Petersen is superb as the obsessive investigator who risks madness each time he takes on a case, and Tom Noonan is absolutely chilling as the psycho killer.","80","91474"
"14864","A worthy sequel to ""Star Wars,"" equal in both technical mastery and characterization, suffering only from the familiarity with the effects generated in the original and imitated too much by others.","80","80684"
"14865","Needless to say, the film’s big Brit hitters – Peter Ustinov, Laurence Olivier and especially Charles Laughton – all make exceptional work of Dalton Trumbo’s reflective screenplay, while Kubrick himself handles the film’s mechanics of corruption with skill.","80","54331"
"14866","Computer-generated animated movies with wall-to-wall jokes can be excruciating, but these jokes are the funniest money can buy.","80","413267"
"14867","What begins as a smart, effective throwback to simple post-apocalyptic survival stories evolves into a knuckle-biting, chest-tightening thriller that combines old-fashioned character work with the modern efficiency of intensity and dread.","80","6644200"
"14868","Its main focus is the sparky, shifting relationship between its two protagonists and its trump card the startling chemistry between its two main stars.","80","2431286"
"14869","Instead of a thriller, war movie or western, the director has turned out a stirring drama about South African leader Nelson Mandela, blending entertainment, social message and history lesson.","80","1057500"
"14870","It's got power and depth, and two kings whose greatness is diluted by hubris, and a thrilling dragon fight, and the demon Grendel as a tortured outcast, and a naked monster who looks a lot like Angelina Jolie.","80","442933"
"14871","Wilde’s mighty struggle with himself, with his heavenly talent and earthly lusts, and the meaning of it all resonates so strongly with the direction and performance that The Happy Prince is easily elevated past period Victoriana (and that wallpaper) to move and engage in equal parts.","80","2404639"
"14872","The director's stylistic self-denial serves to keep one's attention fastened where it belongs: on a persuasive, if perhaps debatable vision of Gandhi's spirit, and on the remarkable actor who has caught its light in all its seasons.","80","83987"
"14873","A sleek, whooshingly entertaining update of the vintage television series.","80","117060"
"14874","With Kick-Ass, there are more cheap thrills, gory explosions and superheroes than a movie geek's YouTube mash-up.","80","1250777"
"14875","The Bourne Identity, like its hero, triumphs through sheer unreflective professionalism. It is, by today's standards, a modest thriller, with a self-contained storyline and with very few big special effects.","80","258463"
"14876","Suffice to say, Suspiria tries to do much, culminating in a finale that’s almost laughably over-the-top. But the passion of Guadagnino’s messy vision — the swirl of emotions he conjures on this grand canvas — has a forcefulness that mostly transcends its sizable flaws.","80","1034415"
"14877","It clocks in at over three hours, but Peter Jackson's remake of the 1933 classic is gripping. The film rethinks the characters, turning the original's stark Jungian fantasy into a soulless but skillful set of kinetic and emotional effects.","80","360717"
"14878","Jarring and electrifying drama.","80","73486"
"14879","Jennings's film, with its missing fathers, sometimes threatens to become cloying, but it's almost always righted by a healthy dose of slapstick or the spectacle of little kids posing as muscle-bound killers.","80","845046"
"14880","While Twohy has some fabulous technology at his disposal and uses it to great effect, the answer to that second question is obvious: He keeps us on the edge of our seats not by dazzling us with lights and sound (even if the sound is spectacular) but by tantalizing his audience with basic, well-wrought suspense.","80","115571"
"14881","Talladega Nights may be brash, unbridled, even unhinged, but its cornpone humor is rich in parody, and its craftsmanship is superb -- smart writing, shrewd direction, precisely calibrated performances (whether the calibration calls for delicacy or broad-gauge burlesque), inventive language, inspired silliness and all-but-flawless timing.","80","415306"
"14882","To steal from Ali, this one floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee.","80","405159"
"14883","This is a one-riff movie and instant cult classic.","80","310357"
"14884","Like a superior, state-of-the-art model built from reconstituted parts, Joss Whedon's buoyant, witty and robustly entertaining superhero smash-up is escapism of a sophisticated order.","80","848228"
"14885","McCarthy’s performance, which is paired with an equally rewarding turn by British actor Richard E. Grant, anchors this bizarre, compelling true story.","80","4595882"
"14886","Snobs may balk, purists will be appalled, but this new and exceedingly nasty version of Wes Craven's 1977 cult shocker is awfully good at what it does. And mostly what it does is make you feel awful.","80","454841"
"14887","The allusions and illusions are just a treat until about two-thirds of the way in, when a genuinely shocking development takes the film off into psycho-horror that is almost as baffling as it is unsatisfying.","80","101410"
"14888","A distinctively absorbing entertainment, offering just enough popcorn thrills for mass audiences and just enough chewiness for hardcore sci-fi fans.","80","120903"
"14889","A happily self-aware body-count flick that's as brutally funny as it is plain-old brutal. A broad slash of scary, sci-fi fun, the project leapfrogs all the Scream and Last Summer junk to carve itself a new, high-tech niche.","80","211443"
"14890","A touch too heavy on the Faust scenario, this is nevertheless a typically powerful effort from Stone especially strong on the nightmarish aspects of the war, as when a simple misundertsanding instantly becomes a massacre...Gripping stuff","80","91763"
"14891","The more fanatic Ozophiles may dispute M-G-M's remodeling of the story, but the average movie-goer – adult or adolescent – will find it novel and richly satisfying to the eye.","80","32138"
"14892","Stylistically, it's a remarkable effort -- with a continuous sense of gliding motion -- and the film is entertaining and gripping throughout.","80","99685"
"14893","Pointlessness, isolation and the guarantee that no one will ever understand your plight may not sound like the makings of a laugh-filled heartwarmer, but in the hands of Barbakow and screenwriter Andy Siara, it is.","80","9484998"
"14894","Nimbly blending comedy and action -- with an affectionate slo-mo nod to John Woo -- McKay does his best work to date here.","80","1386588"
"14895","In short, Cronenberg has made an elegant film, with spanking. There's some mildly kinky sex in A Dangerous Method, but Cronenberg makes it neither exploitive nor so tasteful that it loses its charge.","80","1571222"
"14896","The Coens' typically superior filmmaking sustains the electrifying mood for most of the picture, but they are undone by being too faithful to the source novel by Cormac McCarthy.","80","477348"
"14897","Not to be missed, one of the year's best, a whole lotta laughs, and 4-stars all rolled into one.","80","173716"
"14898","Director Michael Ritchie refreshingly shows no reverence for film noir. And screenwriter Andrew Bergman, who co-wrote ""Blazing Saddles,"" shows no mercy in what turns out to be a good mystery as well as comedy. [31 May 1985, p.25]","80","89155"
"14899","""Iron Man"" has more wit and style, but Hulk is a neat thrill ride with an intelligent script by Zak Penn and smart, well-paced direction by the French director of ""The Transporter"" series, Louis Leterrier.","80","800080"
"14900","Its magnificence is that it takes itself dead serious. It's not entertainment, but it's sure a piece of toughness.","80","364569"
"14901","Lee’s latest is as much a compelling black empowerment story as it is an electrifying commentary on the problems of African-American representation across more than a century of cinema.","80","7349662"
"14902","Superman II is a success, a stirring sequel to the smash of '79. Whether you will prefer it to the original is like choosing between root beer and Fresca. They're both bubbly, but the flavor is different. What the follow-up doesn't have is the epic lyricism of Richard Donner's version; it's harder edged, fleeter on its feet, less reverential. [22 June 1981, p.87]","80","81573"
"14903","Lee, who made the upbeat ""Eat Drink Man Woman,"" plays this double love story as brightly as possible. There's peppy social satire in the smallest of gestures.","80","114388"
"14904","What Whannell wants most to do is torment and eventually pulverize most of the people in his narrative orbit and make you laugh while he does so.","80","6499752"
"14905","As thrilling and smart as it is terrifying. There have been a number of big-gun literary series brought to screen over the past decade. This slays them all.","80","1392170"
"14906","Mr. Forman has preserved the fascinating heart of Mr. Shaffer's play, and made it available to millions who might never enter a legitimate theater. Well done.","80","86879"
"14907","When Terminator is not taking itself seriously -- and sometimes even when it is -- it's lots of fun. And filmmakers James Cameron and Gale Anne Hurd don't drown us in blood, though it's not for the squeamish.","80","88247"
"14908","A cleverly constructed, sensationally stylish and often darkly hilarious seriocomic caper.","80","1032755"
"14909","This unapologetically grown-up movie about separating is perhaps the most revealing American movie of its era. Though the director, Alan Parker, doesn't do anything innovative in technique, it's a modern movie in terms of its consciousness.","80","84675"
"14910","The kills themselves are both bountiful and bloody, the movie references are brilliant and bloody, the funny is very frequent and very frequently bloody, but to say any more would ruin the boo.","80","1262416"
"14911","There was no way, no matter how much Spielberg flounce was imbued in this sprightly sequel, that it was going to be as good as the original. It isn't. By a long shot. But even two thirds of the way toward Jurassic Park is about a third better than your average buster of blocks.","80","119567"
"14912","Burton's finest, freshest film in ages is a welcome homecoming. You'd call it patchwork pastiche, if it weren't so zapped with energy, feeling and imagination. It's alive!","80","1142977"
"14913","Knocked Up touches places most comedies wouldn't dare, some of them scarily biological, some of them scarily accurate. It's the sleeper hit of the summer, but don't worry: it's much better than that.","80","478311"
"14914","Original, sad, suspenseful and involving: the kind of work that helps independent American cinema retain its good name.","80","978759"
"14915","Coraline is essentially faithful to the spirit of its source material. But it's also so visually inventive, and so elaborately tactile, that it stands apart as its own creation.","80","327597"
"14916","While the pic doesn't really have meaty characters, the presence of Neill, Carmen, Heston and Prochnow lends an air of credibility that heightens the proceedings. The film is also blessed with an arsenal of special effects that work with tinker-toy precision.","80","113409"
"14917","Watchmen has moments of greatness. It proves again that the action movie is where the best young Hollywood brains have gone to bring flesh to their fantasies.","80","409459"
"14918","A luxuriously watchable and satirical suspense drama.","80","6751668"
"14919","Rachel Weisz’s arresting, combative Lipstadt, a shining woman warrior, is a role she will be remembered for, while as her antagonist Timothy Spall (Mr. Turner) makes a spookily stubborn, thoroughly despicable, but still human Irving.","80","4645330"
"14920","Meryl Streep is back in top form. This means that her performance in Out of Africa is at the highest level of acting in film today. Also, since she is Streep, it means that a return to form is not a return: she has realized a character utterly different from any she has done before.","80","89755"
"14921","The movie's special gift happens to be Mark Wahlberg, who gives a terrifically appealing performance in this tricky role.","80","118749"
"14922","A hilarious mixture of Errol Flynn swashbuckler and Monty Python send-up...When it comes to pleasing both kids and adults, you can't do much better.","80","93779"
"14923","With Custody, Legrand has created a family drama that plays out as social realism, but it is as intense as a thriller and, with no generic get outs, far more terrifying than Kubrick's The Shining.","80","6002232"
"14924","This is a tale that, like any number of fanciful genre outings, both pulls you in with its intriguing central dramatic situation and pushes you out with some mightily far-fetched plot contrivances.","80","5109784"
"14925","One of Hollywood's forgotten masters and one of its brightest new actresses team for what could well be an Oscar wild card.","80","1084950"
"14926","But Cate Blanchett ... ahhhh. She doesn't impersonate Katharine Hepburn, she channels her.","80","338751"
"14927","Equity is a smart thriller set in the corporate world that disguises its modest budget with an intelligent script and good set of hooks.","80","3958780"
"14928","This refitting of Claude Chabrol's 1968 classic ""La Femme Infidele"" is less concerned with suspense and dramatic fireworks than is the usual American ""erotic thriller,"" and much more devoted to nuances and the minutiae of how men and women behave, pretend and lie in duplicitous situations.","80","250797"
"14929","Plays like an old-fashioned romantic comedy with updated hardware.","80","356910"
"14930","Funny and brisk, with enough good lines to make the comedy more satisfying than the somewhat routine but still unsettling jolts to the spine.","80","134084"
"14931","As a drama, this is less nourishing than the heritage it pays tribute to. But for Chazelle, the story is just a slight rib around which he builds a modern rhapsody.","80","3783958"
"14932","It’s the actors who make this real-life legal procedural come alive.","80","4916630"
"14933","A startling reminder of exactly how spectacular a director Spielberg can be when he allows himself to be challenged by a subject (in this case World War II) that pushes against his limits.","80","120815"
"14934","The actor's (Murray) quiet, downcast presence modulates the antic busyness that encircles him, and his performance is a triumph of comic minimalism.","80","362270"
"14935","Count this rehab a success.","80","191754"
"14936","Tomorrow Never Dies isn't one of the great Bonds, by any means. But it's familiar, flashy and enjoyable in all the right places.","80","120347"
"14937","The movie made me laugh as much as anything since ""The Hangover"" or the love scenes in ""Avatar.""","80","1231587"
"14938","Ritchie's got something all his own: a go-for-broke energy that cuts through the cliches of the crime genre.","80","208092"
"14939","This is a tighter, smarter film than either Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz, and buried beneath all the blue-goo aliens and terrible punning is a heartfelt meditation on the perils and pleasures of nostalgia.","80","1213663"
"14940","Love Excalibur or hate it, but give Boorman credit for the loopy grandeur of his imagery and imaginings, for the sweet smell of excess, for his heroic gamble that a movie can dare to trip over its pretensions— and still fly.","80","82348"
"14941","Everyone treats his material with the proper combination of solemnity and good humor that avoids condescension. One of Mr. Lucas's particular achievements is the manner in which he is able to recall the tackiness of the old comic strips and serials he loves without making a movie that is, itself, tacky.","80","76759"
"14942","Often graceful, sometimes brilliant, Poetic is an absorbing, amusing symphony of sound and image; it also gives equal weight to its male and female characters.","80","107840"
"14943","The moral dilemmas are perfectly fused with the amped-up action and outsize characters, but they're impossible to miss: like all of us, the people of Gotham have to protect themselves from evil without falling prey to it.","80","468569"
"14944","Sensationally made and in patches pretty nerve-jangling.","80","278504"
"14945","A debonair macabre thriller--romantic, scary, satisfying.","80","56923"
"14946","McG has sparked a moribund franchise back to life, giving fans the post-apocalyptic action they’ve been craving since they first saw a metal foot crush a human skull two decades ago.","80","438488"
"14947","Here the idea of sleep as the ultimate threat is still fresh and marvelously insidious, and Craven vitalizes the nightmare sequences with assorted surrealist novelties.","80","87800"
"14948","Queen & Slim tackles urgent, difficult subjects with bravery, care and adrenalised genre cool. But it triumphs because it shows you the personal toll beyond the politics. And how black lives brimming with potential can still turn on one fateful moment.","80","8722346"
"14949","Essentially a solemn, splintered meditation on lost love: a movie about personal space, in space.","80","307479"
"14950","It's a lot of fun to watch - over two hours of thrills, spills, elaborate sets and special effects, all tied together by a pleasingly varied (and lighter than usual) musical score by John Williams.","80","102057"
"14951","As ever, Almodóvar has made a film about pleasure, which is itself a pleasure: witty, intelligent and sensuous.","80","8291806"
"14952","Calvary boasts a sharp sense of place and a deep love of language. It's puckish and playful, mercurial and clever, rattling with gallows laughter as it paints a portrait of an Irish community that is at once intimate and alienated.","80","2234003"
"14953","The most enchanting point about cinematographer Eduardo Serra work here is that he hasn't put Vermeer's painting into the film; he has put the film into Vermeer.","80","335119"
"14954","With St. Vincent, the chief pleasure is comedy, which typically arises from waiting to discover what Bill Murray might do next.","80","2170593"
"14955","I resisted this derivative mishmash of classic fairytale and modern epic fantasy for as long as I could, but ultimately it swept me up into its geeky but manly embrace and carried me away on a white charger.","80","1735898"
"14956","Wong Kar-Wai's cinematic style is unmistakable: hip, colorful and energetic and the film's frenetic pacing and exuberant camera work make the streets of Hong Kong a neon wonderland.","80","112913"
"14957","Synecdoche, New York is one heck of a head-trip.","80","383028"
"14958","Writer-director Ari Aster, making a promising feature debut, has created plenty of forbidding atmosphere; there’s almost no shot in the film that isn’t filled with creeping dread. But Hereditary ultimately engages on a more emotional and intellectual register than it does on the visceral.","80","7784604"
"14959","Rush has sex, glamour, a fair degree of wit and a breathless, pedal-to-the-metal spirit. But its greatest achievement may be to underline that there are real men, all vulnerable flesh and blood, inside those infernal machines.","80","1979320"
"14960","Hilarious.","80","195945"
"14961","The roller coaster of events more than compensates for the film's inane dialogue. Innerspace is the stuff summer adventure is made of. [1 July 1987, p.1D]","80","93260"
"14962","The Saint exists almost entirely as a vehicle for Kilmer's quick-change smarty-pants swagger, and it's inconceivable without him. He's great fun to watch--a squirish master thief with a wide streak of lewdness.","80","120053"
"14963","With his “Rocky” spinoff, Creed, writer-director Ryan Coogler confirms every bit of promise he displayed in his 2013 debut, “Fruitvale Station,” offering a smart, kinetic, exhilaratingly well-crafted piece of mainstream filmmaking, and providing actor Michael B. Jordan with yet another substantial stepping stone on his climb to stardom.","80","3076658"
"14964","Yes, disbelief is required not so much to be suspended as removed altogether, but it barely matters as this is an adrenaline blast of the highest order.","80","118880"
"14965","Parallax View is Pakula's best to date; its intrigue is honest, its logic unassailable, and its performances first rate. [24 June 1974, p.58]","80","71970"
"14966","Every car chase, every plane crash, every potential drop off a cliff is a masterpiece of grace and surprise.","80","120755"
"14967","The novelty of his volcanically vulgar, deeply cynical tone may have worn off some, but Iannucci has nonetheless crafted another poisonous cocktail of naked ambition and blustery bravado with a decidedly bitter aftertaste.","80","4686844"
"14968","Made with such elegance, atmosphere and wonderfully mannered performances it will nestle deep inside your head, refusing to budge. The more you ponder it, the better it becomes.","80","368447"
"14969","Written with brio and staged rousingly by director Taylor Hackford, the film is good, kitschy fun -- after all, how can you hate a movie that casts litigators as the new legions of Lucifer?","80","118971"
"14970","Smith’s performance, honed from the previous stage and radio versions, is terrifically good.","80","3722070"
"14971","Suspicious and hilariously self-absorbed, Favreau's every bit as comfortable in California as Charles Grodin's ""Heartbreak Kid"" was in Miami. [18 October 1996, p. C3]","80","117802"
"14972","This unpretentious little bit of superior craftsmanship will be utterly mesmerizing to two kinds of people in particular: those who love cell phones and those who hate them.","80","337921"
"14973","Casting of Caan is effective, as his snide remarks and grumpy attittude are backed up by a physical dimension that makes believable his inevitable fighting back. Bates had a field day with her role, creating a quirky, memorable object of hate.","80","100157"
"14974","As always, Lean's handling of the purely physical aspects of the material is spectacular, with the scenes of revolution, the harsh Russian winters, and Zhivago's trek across the steppes simply unforgettable.","80","59113"
"14975","Among the pleasures to be found here are some amusing sidelong glances at how movies get made and the singing talent of Streep as well as MacLaine. There's not much depth here, but Nichols does a fine job with the surface effects, and the wisecracks keep coming.","80","100395"
"14976","Troy is a fun, energizing piece of summer entertainment, even if it doesn't have the depth or the sustained intensity of ""Gladiator.""","80","332452"
"14977","A terrific theatrical feature debut for television veterans Glen Morgan and James Wong.","80","195714"
"14978","Winds up being faster and funnier than the first time. Chan's acrobatic high jinks play strikingly off of Tucker's wiseass humor.","80","266915"
"14979","Despite a level of lurid violence that may offend many, this movie has a motor humming inside. It's been assembled with ferocious, gleeful expertise, crammed with humor, cynicism and jolts of energy. In many ways, it's the best action movie of the year. [17 Jul 1987]","80","93870"
"14980","An engrossing, influential movie, which screams to be watched on the big screen. Few films will provoke your thoughts so fiercely.","80","66921"
"14981","Classy fare, with posh settings, gorgeous scenery and lots and lots of polishing from director John Madden (""Ethan Frome"") and writer Jeremy Brock.","80","119280"
"14982","This slick and sticky horror is the most accomplished treatment of vampire lore since Near Dark.","80","389722"
"14983","This is a really fun movie. Good, too. Not great, but old-school in its approach to scares and, even better, in its approach to the relationships between kids, outsiders who band together to try to take down a monstrous evil. And maybe flirt a little while they’re at it.","80","1396484"
"14984","This comic fantasy is the best vehicle he's (Sandler) ever had, a high-concept goof that gradually darkens into an emotional nightmare reminiscent of Capra.","80","389860"
"14985","The film is weightless and super-goofy — a blissed-out air balloon of nostalgia. It zips right along, it makes you smile and chortle, it’s a surprisingly sweet-spirited love story.","80","1086064"
"14986","Some of its conceits may not hold up under intense scrutiny, but, generally speaking, it's a good time at the movies.","80","1219289"
"14987","A part of me found Todd Phillips’s radical rethinking of the Batman villain Joker thrillingly uncompromising and hair-raisingly timely. Another thinks it should be locked in a strongbox then dropped in the ocean and never released.","80","7286456"
"14988","Zaillian's usual weakness - a tendency to simplify and sentimentalize - asserts itself from time to time here. But much of the movie has a dry, almost documentary-like tone that helps to keep the material in perspective, as does the filmmaker's loving attention to detail. [13 Aug 1993, p.20]","80","108065"
"14989","Patton's personality--conveyed with pointed theatrical flair by George C. Scott--is registered in rich tones of grandeur and megalomania, genius and petty sadism.","80","66206"
"14990","Cooper does an unusually able job of portraying the marshal. (Review of Original Release)","80","44706"
"14991","Main point of interest will be the work of Bigelow, who has undoubtedly created the most hard-edged, violent actioner ever directed by an American woman.","80","93605"
"14992","The Artist is not just about black-and-white silent pictures. It is a black-and-white silent picture. And it's French.","80","1655442"
"14993","The dialogue is sharp and justly famous, though writer-director Joseph L. Mankiewicz has trouble putting it into the mouths of his actors: nothing sounds remotely natural, and the film is pervaded by the out-of-sync sense of staircase wit—this is a movie about what people wished they'd said. The hoped-for tone of Restoration comedy never quite materializes, perhaps because Mankiewicz's cynicism is only skin-deep, but the film's tinny brilliance still pleases.","80","42192"
"14994","This adaptation of Phoebe Gloeckner’s heavily autobiographical novel is ideally cast and skillfully handled.","80","3172532"
"14995","Aladdin is a treat for adults, as much as it is for children, because the big blue Genie of the lamp is none other than Robin Williams. [25 Nov 1992, p.7B]","80","103639"
"14996","Although character arcs are a little too abruptly truncated as the story moves, Natali never fumbles the big picture.","80","123755"
"14997","Carrey provides one of his most whacked-out and enjoyable performances.","80","1045772"
"14998","The Oscar-nominated Hedges is, as one would expect, superb in the title role, but performances across the board are excellent.","80","7008872"
"14999","Charming, delightful and amusing - just what you'd expect from the star-studded cast of veterans.","80","1412386"
"15000","Like Brown, the movie is dynamic and entertaining as hell.","80","2473602"
"15001","We're told that this new version is tweaked and enhanced, with the E.T. puppet digitally smoothed out, and the guns in the meanies' hands removed (silly, but bravo). [2002 re-release]","80","83866"
"15002","When this actor (Swank) steps into the right role, she wears and inspires it like Denzel Washington.","80","1129445"
"15003","This is a warm, accessible story with delightful characters and a nice metaphor about following your own rules.","80","124315"
"15004","Yet some of the laughs come too easy and linger too long; for the film's message to have maximum impact, the laughter has to stick in your throat.","80","57012"
"15005","It's not that Waters set out to make a social statement here. It's just that the landscape and his mindscape turn out to be a perfect fit.","80","111127"
"15006","While undeniably silly and violent in a cartoon-like manner, is by and large a hilarious skewering of the clichés of teen pix.","80","175142"
"15007","Lucy is insane, makes very little sense, doesn't stand up to scrutiny and is an absolute blast.","80","2872732"

"15009","A couple of sequences in the middle of the movie just mark time, but usually everything works, to make Nashville the most original, provocative high‐spirited film Mr. Altman has yet given.","80","73440"
"15010","There is much to admire in Vol. 1, not least a performance from Uma Thurman as steely as the plate in her character’s head and a knowing soundtrack that effortlessly smears the boundaries between east and west.","80","266697"
"15011","What saves Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is what created it in the first place: J.K. Rowling's enrapturing imagination. At those sporadic moments when the film allows us to share in Harry's wonder, it lets us recapture our own as well.","80","241527"
"15012","Changeling is an almost universally impressive all-around effort, and is the best ""dirty underbelly of Los Angeles"" movie since ""L.A. Confidential.""","80","824747"
"15013","It’s a profound, affecting and beautifully told chronicle of faith, family, obsession and the language of music.","80","1657517"
"15014","The largely elliptical script feels a few drafts shy of focus, with the thriller elements undermining the juicier questions of why one joins a cult and how life can go back to normal later.","80","1441326"
"15015","For most post-apocalyptic films, the nightmare is really a disguised fantasy. In Michôd's excellent The Rover, the nightmare is real.","80","2345737"
"15016","With a riveting portrayal by Cumberbatch at its heart, The Fifth Estate tells its story grippingly - but finally leaves us none the wiser.","80","1837703"
"15017","Develops into an endearingly scrappy and romantic romp that serves up some nice soul-searching moments alongside a steady stream of laughs.","80","1862079"
"15018","Phil Lord and Christopher Miller irreverently deconstruct the state of the modern blockbuster and deliver a smarter, more satisfying experience in its place, emerging with a fresh franchise for others to build upon.","80","1490017"
"15019","If you like your summer popcorn movies laced with a little poisoned butter, Gremlins is not to be missed. [18 June 1984, p.90]","80","87363"
"15020","What ultimately comes through is an undeniably imaginative work that is a glorious testament to the limitless and largely untapped possibilities of cinema.","80","203009"
"15021","Using shadows and strikingly designed sounds, Pellington skillfully creates an atmosphere of otherworldly, invisible menace. Gere and Linney, both solid, dance around the edges of a romance.","80","265349"
"15022","In the best B-movie tradition, the filmmakers embed their ideas in an ingenious, propulsive and suspenseful genre entertainment, one that respects your intelligence even as it makes your eyes pop (and, once in a while, your stomach turn).","80","1136608"
"15023","Vertigo remains something less than a foolproof psychological spellbinder and agonizer. It's compulsively watchable and stylish, but the obsessive and delirious moods seem to exist apart from the creaky plot, which fails to convince one of the nature of the conspiracy that entraps Stewart's character in the first place or of the follow-up system of coincidence that eventually drives him up the fateful bell tower. [10 March 1984, p.G1]","80","52357"
"15024","Hollywood has been waiting for this movie. Get ready for the year of the Tiger.","80","454876"
"15025","What gives Rocky Balboa its unexpected pathos is the titanic humility of Stallone's performance, the earnestness with which he plays a man knocked down (but not out) by the ravages of time.","80","479143"
"15026","The action is the attraction. If that means some of the film feels a little distant and chilly, it’s in the admirable service of avoiding simplistic drama or easy sentiment.","80","5013056"
"15027","The world that Zootropolis creates is intelligent and fascinatingly detailed – it feels more like a movie by Disney-owned Pixar than a straight Disney film.","80","2948356"
"15028","The cast is uniformly superb, and Marc Forster's attentive direction gives proper weight to each perplexing emotion. Strip away the strident melodrama, and you have this season's moodiest, most adult love story.","80","285742"
"15029","By the time this distinctive 1986 film is over we have been treated to a lavish fugue on the themes of childhood, wolves, eroticism and myth. [11 Jun 1989, p.2]","80","87075"
"15030","What makes this treatment unique is that the jokes aren’t so much derivative of pop culture, but are instead found in the learned wisdom of a middle-aged woman reacting to her own teenage dilemmas.","80","91738"
"15031","Paul Newman is at his charismatic best as convict Luke Jackson, fighting to maintain inner freedom despite the brutalities of a deep south chain gang. Much in the style of the old Warner Bros melodramas, the hardnut action here is lightened by a funny streak, as in the celebrated hard-boiled egg-eating contest. [31 Aug 2013, p.46]","80","61512"
"15032","As stylish as it is grisly, Jeepers Creepers has cult film written all over it, and it's not for nothing that Francis Ford Coppola has been a staunch Victor Salva mentor.","80","263488"
"15033","As the team leader, Jackson finds exactly the right tone for the role: a sort of playful cockiness that comes from knowing just how good he is. He's clearly having fun, but he never winks at the audience too much or allows his performance to devolve into camp.","80","257076"
"15034","The most surprising courtroom drama since 1985's ""Jagged Edge,"" The Lincoln Lawyer is a don't-miss cinematic page-turner with enough twists to fill five movies.","80","1189340"
"15035","The film occasionally drags -- a money transfer scene set in a department store lasts longer than several geologic epochs -- but it's so funny and the plot twists are so sudden and violent it's great fun.","80","119396"
"15036","The easy-to-follow screenplay, about the rivalry between two toys -- cowboy Woody and spaceman Buzz Lightyear -- should excite young children; teen-agers and parents can enjoy the brilliantly executed action sequences.","80","114709"
"15037","Few movies so taken with death have felt so rudely alive as ParaNorman, the latest handcrafted marvel from the stop-motion artists at Laika (""Coraline"").","80","1623288"
"15038","Eighth Grade is lovely work, lifted up by a timeless piece of indie wisdom: Keep it real, as cringe-inducing as that can be.","80","7014006"
"15039","After warming up with ""The Thin Red Line"" and ""The New World,"" Malick has succeeded in fully creating his own film syntax, his own temporal reality, and lo, it is … kind of goofy. But riveting.","80","478304"
"15040","Creepy, suspenseful and sustained, this skillfully made lo-fi horror movie plays knowingly with genre tropes and yet never winks at the audience, giving it a refreshing face-value earnestness that makes it all the more gripping.","80","3235888"
"15041","Will seem a classic if you're stoned, and only slightly less funny if you're straight.","80","366551"
"15042","Superman turns out to be a surprisingly infectious entertainment, nicely balanced between warmth and wit, intimacy and impressive special effects, comic-strip fantasy and several elements that make the movie eminently eligible for Deep Thinking about rescue fantasies, cherubic messiahs and other pieces of popcorn metaphysics. [1 Jan 1979, p.46]","80","78346"
"15043","A particularly nice touch is the ability of one of the teenagers to pull people into her dreams, allowing Langenkamp and the threatened kids to gang up against Freddie. The neat script also fills in a little more of the Freddie mythology, including a suitably tasteless account of his conception. A creepy score and Russell's sure grasp of the skewed logic of nightmares helps to sustain the ambiguity between the 'real' and 'dream' worlds, while Englund's Freddie now fits like a glove.","80","93629"
"15044","Great as it undoubtedly is, it's not really a likable film; it's amazing, though--it keeps its freshness and its excitement, even if you resist its cartoon message.","80","15648"
"15045","Danny Glover, as hard-rock reliable as Spencer Tracy in his prime, plays onetime pianist Tyrone ""Pine Top"" Purvis.","80","829193"
"15046","The point of watching the film, and the only reason to see it, is the experience of watching it, which sounds tautological or something, but is just true. It's a powerful visual and sonic creation with unforgettable characters, set in a heartache-inducing imaginary vision of American community, worlds away from hyper-technologized urban existence.","80","2125435"
"15047","Bird Box is scary, but it also feels very human.","80","2737304"
"15048","An intelligent, absorbing, and deeply disturbing horror film that is nearly bloodless in its depiction of violence. Using the age-old technique of suggestion, combined with a gritty, well-executed (no pun intended) visual style, the film seems much bloodier than it actually is.","80","72271"
"15049","The main interest here is the juxtaposing of Gosling's Method acting with Hopkins's more classical style, a spectacle even more mesmerizing than the settings.","80","488120"
"15050","The movie is mercifully uncontaminated by the smarty-pants self-reflexiveness that has sucked the lifeblood from nearly all post-""Scream"" horror pictures. Clever enough not to be too clever, Boyle and Garland play their story straight -- they just want to give you the creeps -- and, by so doing, bring the undead back to cinematic life.","80","289043"
"15051","The Poseidon Adventure is a highly imaginative and lustily-produced meller that socks over the dramatic struggle of 10 passengers to save themselves after an ocean liner capsizes when struck by a mammoth tidal wave created by a submarine earthquake.","80","69113"
"15052","While less beguiling than ""Capote,"" Infamous remains a soulful and searching portrayal of the writer, carried with immense charm and vivacity by its leading man.","80","420609"
"15053","Sleek and satisfying....Almost a drawing room thriller, unhurried and genteel but enlivened with suspense and surprising bursts of sly, even biting, humor.","80","118548"
"15054","Charlie Kaufman is back – with a wistful, resonant film, a bracing, wry, honest dose of cinematic melancholy.","80","2401878"
"15055","Despite the movie's many flaws, the two leads' genuine rapport is enough to give the audience a solid contact high.","80","1155056"
"15056","Although there are points where he gets bogged down in the technical aspects of thievery, the film is a slick Chicago crime-drama with a well-developed sense of pathos running throughout.","80","83190"
"15057","The Big Short means to infuriate its audience, but it’s smart enough to know that such an approach doesn’t preclude a film from being darkly, cathartically funny as well.","80","1596363"
"15058","Slightly overlong and convoluted at times, it presents compelling, sexy characters spouting sharp, believable dialogue.","80","1954470"
"15059","It’s a beautiful, supremely touching performance from Chalamet which gives this surprisingly safe story its moving purity.","80","5726616"
"15060","Disturbing, infuriating yet undeniably effective, less a motion picture than an impassioned. [20 Dec 1991]","80","102138"
"15061","Horror presented without restraint or apology, as a full-bore, blood-soaked load of nomad nastiness caught in constant forward motion.","80","245120"
"15062","What keeps Phone Booth going, despite its premise, is the acting and the writing, both of which are top-notch.","80","183649"
"15063","It's not always easy viewing, but Hard Candy is an intelligent, challenging film which deserves to be seen.","80","424136"
"15064","No film with as many elements as Happy Feet is successful with all of them, and the romantic-emotional elements of this story feel overly familiar. But the music and dancing are fresh and new, and this strong an ecological message has not been seen since Hayao Miyazaki's ""Princess Mononoke.""","80","366548"
"15065","Given the obvious influences on The Double, it could have felt like a facsimile of other films. Instead, it has enough individuality, imagination and idiosyncratic invention to identify it as a true original.","80","1825157"
"15066","Compared to, say, your average Adam Sandler movie it's a master class in film comedy. Oh, you will laugh. You may not forgive yourself for it easily, but you will laugh. You may well laugh to the point of pee stains in your underthings, and if you think that's gratuitous you have no idea.","80","480687"
"15067","Leftist propaganda of a very high order, powerful and intelligent even when the film registers in spots as naive or dated.","80","47443"
"15068","A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master is by far the best of the series, a superior horror picture that balances wit and gore with imagination and intelligence. It very effectively mirrors the anxieties of the teen-age audience for which it is primarily intended. [19 Aug 1988, p.17]","80","95742"
"15069","Superbly shot around Prague -- From Hell is even more stylish than gruesome -- it has the lush decrepitude of an autumn compost heap or an old Hammer werewolf flick.","80","120681"
"15070","Lee has created that rarity in filmmaking: a movie we need, right now.","80","307901"
"15071","Crowe is still a master navigator of swampy territory, and any movie that can warm the heart and tickle the funny bone without selling its soul is to be cherished, warts and all.","80","368709"
"15072","A perfect ensemble of cast, photography and screenplay are all subtly handled through Huston's direction, bringing out Bogart and Hepburn's performances beautifully.","80","43265"
"15073","Screenwriter Michael Goldenberg and director David Yates have transformed J.K. Rowling's garrulous storytelling into something leaner, moodier and more compelling, that ticks with metronomic purpose as the story flits between psychological darkness and cartoonish slapstick.","80","373889"
"15074","Ordinary in some ways and extraordinary in others, The Spectacular Now benefits from an exceptional feel for its main characters on the parts of the director and lead actors.","80","1714206"
"15075","For all of its shortcomings, Wanted is a strangely enjoyable flick.","80","493464"
"15076","By no means perfect - a twist in the tale overextends its already lengthy running time - but it is terrific fun.","80","328107"
"15077","The film becomes cumulatively stranger as it goes along, and it has a lulu of a kicker.","80","264616"
"15078","This is a tough, muscular, idealistic drama that packs a mighty punch, and Shannon and Garfield are excellent.","80","2891174"
"15079","Throughout, there's a skillful balance between the vulnerability of New Yorkers and the drastic, provocative sense of comedy that thrives all over our sidewalks.","80","72251"
"15080","The continuing saga of one of contemporary literature and cinema's most fascinating villains, as played once again with exquisite taste and riveting force by Anthony Hopkins.","80","212985"
"15081","Fassbender cuts a more prosaic, realistic figure as the tormented, romantic Rochester than did the screen's most celebrated performer of the role, Orson Welles, in the effective 1944 version.","80","1229822"
"15082","Foodstuffs, metaphysics and a heap of raunchy action add up to something surprisingly hilarious.","80","1700841"
"15083","The film excels as a visual exercise, as a study in adolescent psychology, and even as astute political analysis (it's the dragon who holds the fiefdom together).","80","82288"
"15084","The Warriors is a deeply silly movie. Its gangs are ridiculous comic-book figures. Still, director Walter Hill treats its world with total seriousness. Bleak synthesizer drones thrum and throb. The streets glow with slickly inky-black greasiness. Nobody smiles. It’s so awesome.","80","80120"
"15085","Handsome, engrossing, frequently very funny for a literary bio drama, and ultimately deeply moving, with pitch-perfect performances from one and all.","80","824758"
"15086","You can see the jokes coming well in advance, but you still laugh uncontrollably.","80","122933"
"15087","[Ritchie] cranks up the laughs and tension with equal aplomb, throwing wrenches in the plot so that the audience has no idea what to expect next -- and that's part of the film's thrill.","80","120735"
"15088","A war film without the war but with some interesting observations nonetheless.","80","83111"
"15089","The central idea is quite clever and appealing, and that the charm meter is turned up all the way.","80","163187"
"15090","This is very much a first feature, with all the hyperbolic, sometimes indiscriminate cinematic energy of a student film. But it's also sensational, a febrile meditation on the mathematics of existence.","80","138704"
"15091","Not quite as smart as it wants to be, and a better action movie than it is a political thriller, this is still a heart-pounding drama.","80","431197"
"15092","Ultimately, it’s the film’s sly irony that sets it a notch above similar actioners. The Thomas brothers’ script repeatedly draws us down dead-end alleys only to reverse expectations and top white-knuckle situations with thrilling conclusions.","80","116253"
"15093","Armageddon is as irresistible as it's indefensible.","80","120591"
"15094","Undeniably funny and gooey to boot, Slither may not be groundbreaking but it is a rarity: a horror-comedy that does both its genre-parents proud.","80","439815"
"15095","Walter Hill, the director of such beautiful but stilted tough guy movies as ''The Warriors'' and ''The Long Riders,'' has attempted something very different in 48 Hours a male-buddy action film that's positively witty and warm-hearted compared with his other work.","80","83511"
"15096","On a scene-by-scene basis, in terms of performance and the grave issues under consideration, the film is quite absorbing.","80","107818"
"15097","Centipede plays on the notion that the only thing more frightening than death is a state bridging life and death, in which, though one's body is no longer his own to control, the mind remains conscious.","80","1467304"
"15098","It teases out the distinctly modern subject of celebrity profile-writing, a rare one for the movies, detouring into avenues of attraction and envy.","80","3416744"
"15099","What makes A Simple Plan an exciting, thoughtful thriller isn't the plot twists, but the twists and turns of Hank's tortured conscience as one lie leads to bigger and deadlier deceits.","80","120324"
"15100","If director Thompson isn't quite skilful enough to give the film its final touch of class (many of the shocks are just too planned), the relentlessness of the story and Mitchum's tangibly sordid presence guarantee the viewer's quivering attention.","80","55824"
"15101","The always surprising Coen brothers have finally made a very serious movie with A Serious Man. It's about God, man's place in the world and the meaning of life, so naturally it's one of their funnier movies.","80","1019452"
"15102","Arteta targets Middle American ennui with wit, compassion and no shortage of ornery malaise.","80","279113"
"15103","Annihilation is more than mere visuals and it will shock, fascinate and haunt whatever screen it’s watched on.","80","2798920"
"15104","Too many movies come to us as preordained cult objects - this is the real deal.","80","1667307"
"15105","Intelligent, classy and skin-crawling. You won't see a better acting masterclass this year.","80","465551"
"15106","Terry Gilliam's darkly funny and truly visionary retro-futurist fantasy is a mess dramatically, and its turbulent history echoes the battles fought by Orson Welles against studio executives bent on recutting or scuttling his films.","80","88846"
"15107","An obligatory setup for a sequel slows down the final moments, but until then, Tomb Raider feels like a perfectly paced trio of espresso shots, with a shot of adrenaline to the heart as a chaser.","80","1365519"
"15108","John Wells's The Company Men is a juicy, judicious drama, and one of the few current movies to address an issue that affects many of the people who will see it - or, because reality is too depressing, avoid it.","80","1172991"

"15141","The beautiful surprise of Honey Boy is it never feels like LaBeouf revels in the chance to put the spotlight on himself. He wrote the film while in rehab and every moment of the movie feels like an artist in search of a desperately craved and needed catharsis.","80","8151874"

Is the film a fairy tale disguised as a revisionist history lesson? Yes, you can see it that way. Does it offer a commentary on the ills of modern society? I think so. Is it a combination of all those things and more? Very likely.","80","81633"
"15149","The film belongs to Foster. The actor always makes the most of what is handed him, though he's usually required to find his footings around the margins, as he did as the crazed cowboy in ""3:10 to Yuma"" or the crazed druggie in ""Alpha Dog.""","80","790712"

"15151","Clue is campy, high-styled escapism.

"15163","It's a powerfully ersatz experience, but at least it's powerful. There's a lot to like here: At three hours and 14 minutes, the film takes longer to watch than the Titanic took to sink.","80","120338"
"15164","Amusing, ultra-deadpan entertainment. The director was lucky enough to have a cast who were in on the joke and tuned in to his wavelength.","80","142688"

"15167","For his first thriller set in America, from 1942, Alfred Hitchcock runs loopily through a gamut of genres, filming in a range of settings, from California to New York, to depict a country that lives in the image of its movies. His set pieces take on the blue-collar drama, the Western, the high-society mystery, the urban police story, and the circus melodrama, while capturing the paranoia of a country newly at war.","80","35279"

"15171","Overlord, produced and presumably overseen by J.J. Abrams, is good, bloody fun, with all the polish and production value that come with not being a low-budget exploitation movie.","80","4530422"
"15172","Though not all the relationships are entirely clear — the thieves' relationship with Brandt, for example, remains somewhat vague — and there might be some minor issues that could become apparent on multiple viewings, this is first and foremost a rollicking and very imaginatively staged ride that’s enjoyable and different.","80","6241872"
"15173","Garofalo is amazing, as always, and the film is almost about her as much as the leads. The recreation of the casts' high school years is wickedly funny and dead on.","80","120032"
"15174","The Wild Bunch contains faults and mistakes, but its accomplishments are more than sufficient to confirm that Peckinpah, along with Stanley Kubrick and Arthur Penn, belongs with the best of the newer generation of American film makers.","80","65214"
"15175","People who crave a movie about a secret agent with her own sexual agency — and a mission to give male predators exactly what they deserve — are going to want front-row seats. And a sequel.","80","2873282"
"15176","A sharper account of the Iwo Jima conflict than Flags, this balances its unflinching handling of the horrors of war with its touching portrayal of those who face them.","80","498380"
"15177","After the disappointing martial-monster mash-up of The Great Wall, this represents a return to the majesty and emotional finesse of Hero and House of Flying Daggers.","80","6864046"
"15178","This is Steven Soderbergh at his best delivering a gripping, chilling and powerful movie experience that will have audiences talking (and freaking out).","80","1598778"
"15179","The remarkable thing is the way characters, jokes and meaning are dovetailed into a single rhythmic flow that makes the film look like TV's Laugh-In redesigned as a Minnelli musical. Highly enjoyable.","80","74281"
"15180","[Filmmaker John] Hughes must refer to this as his ‘”Bergman film”: lots of deep talk and ripping off of psychic scabs. But this film maker is, spookily, inside kids. He knows how the ordinary teenagers, the ones who don’t get movies made about them, think and feel: why the nerd would carry a fake ID (”So I can vote”), and why the deb would finally be nice to the strange girl (” ‘Cause you’re letting me”). He has learned their dialect and decoded it for sympathetic adults. With a minimum of genre pandering—only one Footloose dance imitation—and with the help of his gifted young ensemble, Hughes shows there is a life form after teenpix. It is called goodpix.","80","88847"
"15181","Here is a picture that has wit, a hairpin-turn narrative, high pizazz and ensemble star quality. Ready, set, Go.","80","139239"
"15182","Even when the storytelling falters - several crucial scenes take place in between the various segments, with major events happening off-screen - Jenkins' sharp eye and his film's beautiful cinematography keeps us watching.","80","4975722"

"15184","The nonsense is generally good and at times it reaches the level of first-class satiric burlesque. Adolph Green and Betty Comden may have tossed off the script with their left hands, but occasionally they come through with powerful and hilarious round-house rights.","80","45152"
"15185","Faster and, if possible, furiouser than its predecessors.","80","440963"
"15186","Time has tamed some of the terror and eroticism of Nicolas Roeg’s Don’t Look Now, but it’s still a haunting thriller about guilt and the supernatural. What’s notable (more notable even than the much celebrated bedroom scene between Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland, in which sex is displaced into memory even as it’s taking place) is that Roeg’s use of the death of a child as the focus of a horror film never feels exploitative.","80","69995"
"15187","You may find yourself passing a very enjoyable couple of hours with the oddest of odd couples.","80","67185"
"15188","Drugstore Cowboy, Gus Van Sant Jr.'s glum, absorbing film about a clan of heroin addicts who travel around the Pacific Northwest Looting pharmacies of their supplies the way Bonnie and Clyde cleaned out banks, gives Matt Dillon the role of his career.","80","97240"
"15189","Cunningly scripted and acted, and talky in the best sense, the film is engrossing to watch but not especially interesting to ponder afterward; it's certainly an improvement on formulaic Hollywood, but on a thematic level there's still more windup than delivery.","80","98724"
"15190","Scarface is a grandiose modern morality play, excessive, broad and operatic at times.","80","86250"
"15191","It’s undeniably thrilling to watch Gonzalez Iñárritu and Keaton aiming so high. Whenever they’re brave enough to leap into the unknown, Birdman soars.","80","2562232"
"15192","Hits the screen with its disarmingly droll spirit quite intact.","80","371724"

"15200","It’s the perfect role for Lynskey, who’s wise enough to underplay her character, which allows audiences to pour their own fears and frustrations into everything Ruth represents. And what emerges is a stalwart actress’s best work yet, delivered by an exciting new director to watch.","80","5710514"
"15201","Above all, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a triumph of technique.","80","421715"
"15202","While Franco can sometimes be a wild card, getting increasingly self-conscious with recent roles, his take on Ralston feels both credible and compelling; few actors could have made us care so much, or disappeared so completely into the role.","80","1542344"
"15203","I really like the sequel. No, I'll go one step further – I love the sequel. It's missing some major players, both in front and behind the camera. But really, Airplane II has some seriously funny gags.","80","83530"

"15206","This grandly conceived and executed epic tries to give equal weight to intimate human emotions and speculation about the cosmos, with mixed results, but is never less than engrossing, and sometimes more than that.","80","816692"
"15207","It sounds like a downer but A Single Man is exciting, emotionally alive filmmaking, a potent cocktail of style and substance. And Firth thoroughly deserves the Oscar.","80","1315981"
"15208","With a plot that plays like a string of incidental encounters, The Meddler could easily have felt like a glorified sitcom. But its heroine’s grief, her goodness and her complicated relationship with her daughter all feel so lived-in and true that the film stays grounded.","80","4501454"
"15209","A brainy weave of satire and fantasy.","80","125439"
"15210","Perhaps the riskiest mainstream movie in years, Vaughn’s love letter to spy movies may be uneven in places, but it’s ultra-violent, envelope-pushing, and fun enough to overcome the flaws.","80","2802144"
"15211","Appeal lies on the bright, shiny surface of its ostensibly simple plot, and in its rat-a-tat-tat language, which often sounds like Mamet-visits-Spyne.","80","203119"
"15212","With first-rate performances from Sean Penn and Naomi Watts and a compelling script, this suspenseful, taut drama should keep audiences nailed to their seats.","80","977855"
"15213","As a vehicle for the impudent comic stylings of Ryan Reynolds, this cheerfully demented origin story is many, many cuts above “Green Lantern,” and as a sly demolition job on the superhero movie, it sure as hell beats “Kick-Ass.”","80","1431045"
"15214","Damon can elevate just about anything in which he appears.","80","1389137"
"15215","The great thing about Breakdown is simply that what you see is what you get. Want 90 minutes of edge of the seat tension? You got it. Want an unravelling nightmare that stays with you long after the movie? You got it.","80","118771"
"15216","The work bears the burden of Classical Hollywood, making it not only a film about two people decoupling, but a striking example of forms in combat, struggling for a dominant voice.","80","62407"
"15217","Charming and watchable. The three leads show their comedy potential.","80","94137"
"15218","A deliriously trashy, exuberantly vulgar, lavishly appointed exploitation picture, this weird combo of road-kill movie and martial-arts vampire gorefest is made to order for the stimulation of teenage boys.","80","116367"

"15220","Poltergeist proves closets are full of skeletons and scurrying ids. Hooper and company arouse childhood fears, teasing away adult defenses, making us hunker in our seats as the kids dive under the ""Star Wars"" sheets. It gives us the jeebies, third stage, without letting up, but spiritually, it's uplifting. [4 June 1982, p.13]","80","84516"
"15221","Darkman is funny, but it’s no joke; it’s the work of a man who underlines the conventions of adventure stories and horror because he enjoys them, and knows that even when rendered tongue-in-cheek, they’re timeless.","80","99365"
"15222","It's so shamelessly obliging that just about every audience of whatever stripe will find something to like in it at least some of the time. It's a confoundingly enjoyable movie because, by all rights, it should be terrible.","80","112571"
"15223","A strong contender for both the artiest drug movie and the druggiest art movie ever made, Gaspar Noé's tour de force of forced perspectives and free-form grief is, in every sense of the word, a trip.","80","1191111"
"15224","A cheerfully vulgar and bitchy, but essentially warmhearted, road movie with a difference, which boasts an amazing star turn by Terence Stamp as a transsexual, Stephan Elliott's second feature is a lot of fun.","80","109045"

"15226","12 Years a Slave works so hard to be noble, but it doesn't have to: Ejiofor is there to do all the heavy lifting.","80","2024544"
"15227","The best movie ever made about baseball, and it's not even really that close... ""Major League"" was funny, but Bull Durham is funny, literate, romantic, and overwhelmingly adherent to the idiosyncracies of the game.","80","94812"
"15228","It’s one of his least crazy films in narrative terms, but you couldn’t call it subdued, because the colours and textures he’s coaxed from a new director of photography, Jean-Claude Larrieu, are even more intoxicating than ever – it’s like an unexpectedly dry martini in a dazzling Z-stem glass.","80","4326444"
"15229","What is interesting is not how little sense Déjà Vu makes but how little that matters. If you want your films to add up logically, you're welcome to take your calculator somewhere else. But if you do, you will be missing out on some first-class genre fun.","80","453467"
"15230","An actors' movie and an advert for therapy, extremely bitter, but handsomely directed in its elegant pretentiousness, it leaves you the impression that Redford is, despite it all, as cuddly as a teddy-bear.","80","81283"
"15231","This film is conceived as a showcase for its performers, and, as that, it is immaculate.","80","2671706"
"15232","Suspenser starring Gregory Peck and Lee Remick as the unwitting parents of the Antichrist. Richard Donner's direction is taut. Players all are strong.","80","75005"

"15234","A moving, complex and dreamlike tale.","80","120255"
"15235","The final third shifts into high-adrenaline action mode with some thrilling set pieces as Michelle faces unexpected new threats, making the paradoxical conclusion satisfying on multiple levels as it delivers on the thriller setup while introducing surprising new developments.","80","1179933"
"15236","Though this movie waltzes to its own strange rhythm, del Toro hits every note.","80","2554274"
"15237","The 40-Year-Old-Virgin is a hit, I would warrant, because it’s truly dirty and truly romantic at the same time, a combination that's very hard to pull off.","80","405422"
"15238","A contemporary whodunnit that both respects and revises the subgenre. ... It’s such a rare pleasure to see a director so in love with a genre without slipping into Tarantinoesque fanboy indulgence, remembering his audience is bigger than himself and also that his film requires both head and heart.","80","8946378"
"15239","As well-meaning and ""sensitive"" as Awakenings is, it never rises much above the level of a grade-A tear-jerker. It achieves most of its effects by tenderizing raw material into something marshmallowy. [20 Dec 1990, p.1]","80","99077"
"15240","(Douglas) is a superb (and underused) comic actor, one who knows that the secret of being funny is never begging for a laugh.","80","185014"
"15241","The Post passes the trickiest tests of a historical drama: It makes us understand that decisions that have been validated by the lens of history were difficult ones to make in the moment, and it generates suspense over how all the pieces fell into place to make those decisions come to fruition.","80","6294822"
"15242","Keeps you hanging on every twist and turn of its wilder-than-fiction plot.","80","146309"
"15243","Here, the comedy breathes, and the illusion that it's not a factory-assembled product (which it most certainly is) is a nifty one. For a major studio blockbuster, the thing is darned chummy, and above all, that rare, modest thing, a good show.","80","97428"
"15244","If all three of the women’s lives had come across with equal weight and artistry, the film, which glides back and forth among them, might have approached the symphonic. But only the Streep section truly inspires the kind of awe and terror that the film as a whole strives for.","80","274558"

"15249","Philadelphia filmmaker Cheryl Dunye has such a light, easy touch both in front and in back of the camera that you're in danger of not noticing how skillful a craftsman she really is or how deftly she raises serious issues of race and sexual orientation in The Watermelon Woman.","80","118125"
"15250","A furiously paced, inventive and flat-out hilarious take on a tried-and-tested formula. An exemplary bromantic comedy that doesn't sacrifice heart in pursuit of laughs, maintaining plenty of the former and a superabundance of the latter.","80","1119646"
"15251","The stylistic fun Stone has in dramatizing this crime of passion thoroughly revitalizes the well-worked genre.","80","120399"
"15252","As a filmmaker, Baker is a graceful neorealist voyeur who thrives on improvisation, and his storytelling, in The Florida Project, is mostly just a series of anecdotes. But that turns out to be enough.","80","5649144"
"15253","There are so many colors to McKellen's performance, so many diverse emotions fleetingly play on his face, that resisting his art is out of the question. Better work by an actor will not be seen this year.","80","120684"
"15254","Graced with a clever script, a cast that will make you smile until you ache, and a snappy sense of pace, this summer '92 hit is the funniest by-the-numbers comedy in who knows how long.","80","105417"
"15255","George Nofi pulls off a relative rarity in his feature film debut by creating a genuinely romantic fantasy suspense thriller.","80","1385826"
"15256","It's a small film whose power is derived from its stripped-down scale.","80","185937"
"15257","A firepowered, blood-drenched action picture that doesn't let up.","80","95016"
"15258","From our current vantage point, the film's appeal has less to do with surrealism than nostalgia. It's a movie that potently evokes bygone attitudes and aesthetics -- a relic of the age of pre-digital effects, a product of both Cold War paranoia and midcentury techno-utopianism. [03 Jun 2007, p.E19]","80","60397"
"15259","But while rooted in British sensibilities, Bean is not to be confused with a Noel Coward comedy. Not every gag in Bean succeeds, but compared with most comedies, this one is a keeper.","80","118689"
"15260","The tremendous power of Aronofsky's filmmaking -- its omnivorous omnipotence, if that makes any sense -- has the curious effect of diluting its emotional impact.","80","180093"
"15261","A fun techno romp, mixing great bang for your buck with insights into the dangers of restricting civil liberties. Now, anyone for Shia killing blondes dressed as his dead mother?","80","1059786"
"15262","Baumbach pushes beyond sincerity in search of truth, drawing from such stylistic forebears as the French New Wave, Woody Allen and Andy Warhol's Factory films to capture a reality that has eluded him on his more polished dramedies.","80","2347569"
"15263","Thanks to a remarkable script by Bruce Joel Rubin and the directorial skills of Adrian Lyne, this works as both a highly effective stream-of-consciousness puzzle thriller offering the viewer not one but many ""solutions"" and an emotionally persuasive statement about the plight of many American vets who fought in Vietnam.","80","99871"
"15264","Sandler turns the joke around on his detractors and manages to lead a devilishly energetic vehicle that contains about as many laughs as his previous features combined.","80","185431"
"15265","Clever, original and terrifically witty.","80","385267"
"15266","As good an all-out, non-camp horror movie as we’ve had lately.","80","387564"
"15267","It works because of Anderson's ability to challenge viewer expectations. Instead of making his principal actors change, he manipulates the story and dialogue to match their characters. His exquisite art-house camera shots and sense of pacing set Sandler up to do his usual thing in an almost poetic manner.","80","272338"
"15268","If only modern American politics were remotely as entertaining.","80","443272"
"15269","Tense, powerful and considerably less crass than ""Crash,"" Elah may be jammed with ideas that don’t all connect, but Jones’ devastating performance makes this a compassionate and very human look at the Iraq conflict.","80","478134"
"15270","Rick Moranis is properly nerdish as the flower-shop attendant who keeps his carnivorous charge supplied with a steady stream of human plasma, and Ellen Greene makes a good scatterbrained innocent in the ersatz Broadway mold, but the best moments in this 1987 release belong to Dr. Steve Martin as a dentist with a professional yen for pain.","80","91419"
"15271","A blast of comic irreverence that serves as a starring vehicle for two stoner characters who had previously been relegated to the sidelines.","80","261392"
"15272","The Dark Knight Rises may be a hammy, portentous affair but Nolan directs it with aplomb. He takes these cod-heroic, costumed elements and whisks them into a tale of heavy-metal fury, full of pain and toil, surging uphill, across the flyovers, in search of a climax.","80","1345836"
"15273","Judd Apatow's instincts have rarely been sharper, wiser or more relatable than in This Is 40, an acutely perceptive, emotionally generous laffer about the joys and frustrations of marriage and middle age.","80","1758830"
"15274","While The Fault In Our Stars is more pastel watercolor than hard-edged drama, it’s still hugely warm and winning, thanks in large part to Boone’s unfussy, wistful direction.","80","2582846"
"15275","One of the best of Altman's early movies, using classic themes - the ill-fated love of gambler and whore, the gunman who dies by the gun, the contest between little man and big business - to produce a non-heroic Western.","80","67411"
"15276","Sometimes engrossing, sometimes exasperating romance. In these scenes, Cotillard shows she doesn't need the validation of Cannes or the Academy. Her strong, subtle performance is gloriously winning on its own.","80","2053425"
"15277","A sharply made, perfectly cast and unfailingly absorbing melodrama. But, like the director's adaptation of another publishing phenomenon, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, three years ago, it leaves you with a quietly lingering feeling of: “Is that all there is?”","80","2267998"
"15278","A terrific performance by Mary Elizabeth Winstead as a rock-bottom alcoholic is only one reason to appreciate Smashed, an affecting and immersive addiction drama about the unforeseen pitfalls along the road to recovery.","80","2063781"
"15279","While it's all grand opera, and driven by sweeping gestures and pompous, overwritten dialogue, it is prone to plain silliness - especially in granting us the big showdown at the close. But the sheer dynamism of the action, coupled with Hans Zimmer's lavish score and the forcefield of Crowe, still makes this a fiercesome competitor in the summer movie stakes.","80","172495"
"15280","[A] beautiful, humane and moving biopic.","80","810819"
"15281","This narrative directing debut by Sacha Gervasi remains absorbing and aptly droll despite a few dramatic ups and downs and, led by large performances by Anthony Hopkins and Helen Mirren.","80","975645"
"15282","It plays to the strengths of its performers, from screen novices to the comic vet of the cast, Leslie Mann, who may never have had this good a showcase.","80","2531344"
"15283","A brilliantly realized series of sucker punches, a philosophical howl disguised as a muscular guy movie.","80","137523"
"15284","Though the film stars a relaxed and capable Harrison Ford as everyone's favorite intrepid archaeologist and boasts supporting players ranging from Cate Blanchett as a superb villainess to Shia LaBeouf as the inevitable youngster, the real heroes of this film are director Steven Spielberg and the veritable army of superb technicians who turn the film's numerous stunts and special effects into trains that insist on running on time.","80","367882"
"15285","McDowell is as good as ever here – this time playing Cornelius – while Kim Hunter is hugely sympathetic as Zira.","80","67065"

"15288","Sidney Lumet's film tries very hard to be an original blend of realism, black farce and probing comment on the McLuhanatic Age that creates instant show biz out of what used to be called life. [29 Sep 1975, p.84]","80","72890"
"15289","Runs on wit and creativity.","80","120363"
"15290","A wrenching picture about South Africa that makes no expedient compromises with feel-good entertainment values, A Dry White Season displays riveting performances and visceral style.","80","97243"
"15291","But if you can get swept up in the story, the movie is imaginative and compelling.","80","110148"
"15292","Though The King of Comedy seems less substantial than past De Niro-Scorsese collaborations, it's a funny, stinging film in which there's much to enjoy. Miss Abbott, Mr. De Niro, Mr. Lewis and the unforgettably alarming Sandra Bernhard (as a fan even crazier than Rupert, and one who looks like an enraged ostrich) deliver fine performances, and the film's satirical edge can indeed be cutting.","80","85794"
"15293","Fortunately, Hicks's direction has an elegance and dignity that rescue Shine from the exploitative and give the film an acute, genuinely sensitive style.","80","117631"
"15294","This picture satisfies fully on entertainment terms without cheapening its real-world concerns.","80","2057392"
"15295","The pacing is spot-on, the set-pieces memorable and all the characters are allowed to shine, without it ever becoming The Johnny Depp Show.","80","1790809"
"15296","Body Heat is full of meaty characters and pungent performances...a film to be seen at a drive-in, on a heavy summer night, with someone you trust.","80","82089"
"15297","Feels fresh and satisfying. Maybe it's the presence of Jason Statham, the British action star who has a physicality like no other actor out there right now.","80","472399"
"15298","The picture throws off an aura of wistfulness, which may be Mann's acknowledgment that of course he can't re-create the past. The best he can do is to honor the idea of it, storybook-style, and to remind us that before there was gangsta, there were gangsters.","80","1152836"
"15299","As soon as Howard steps up to the mic, the movie crackles to life.","80","410097"
"15300","This Andy has ""Oscar"" written all over it.","80","125664"
"15301","Starring Ryan Gosling as a Hollywood stuntman/getaway driver, Drive takes the tired heist-gone-bad genre out for a spin, delivering fresh guilty-pleasure thrills in the process.","80","780504"
"15302","Woo has turned out a slick piece of business, filled with explosions and assorted acts of violence brought off with considerable movie-making skill.","80","115759"
"15303","Of course it's hokey and silly, but Reiner really knows how to skirt potential schmaltz and there is a political backbone to the piece which gives it reassuring depth.","80","112346"
"15304","The final effect, particularly the climactic ballroom sequence, is astonishing -- a haunting impression of the vast synchronicity of unbroken time that must surely stand as one of the great achievements in the development of the movie medium.","80","318034"
"15305","Funny peculiar and funny ha ha, with a spontaneity and energy that gather up a powerful emotional head of steam as it chugs along.","80","838221"
"15306","Tried hard to honor the spirit of the franchise, not exploit it, and take it to a new level and a surprising destination.","80","181852"
"15307","Tony Scott steers the movie like a rocket and it never slows down.","80","108399"
"15308","Has its flaws, but it's better, as well as darker, than the first. It's also longer, by nine minutes, but hold that protest to the Kidney Foundation; the time flies, albeit in fits and starts, like players on a Quidditch field.","80","295297"
"15309","Meyers’s drama depends mostly on what it doesn’t show you, and it works.","80","2291540"
"15310","Paul Thomas Anderson does gothic romance in prestige Brit picture style, eliciting a worthy final performance from Daniel Day-Lewis that’s admirably matched by newcomer Vicky Krieps.","80","5776858"
"15311","Ultimately, the thrill of Argo is in watching how the illusion-making of movies found such an unlikely application on the world political stage, where the stakes were literally life and death.","80","1024648"
"15312","Crash is still creepy, still menacing, still hypnotic, and it is still dedicated, in its freaky way, to the ideal of eroticism, to just drifting from erotic scene to erotic scene without much need for story. But Crash is no longer so contemporary. [4K re-release]","80","115964"
"15313","Teaming of Shirley MacLaine and Jack Nicholson at their best makes Terms of Endearment an enormously enjoyable offering for Christmas, adding bite and sparkle when sentiment and seamlessness threatens to sink other parts of the picture.","80","86425"
"15314","Ms. Kendrick — whether playing daffy, amorous, insightful or indignant — carries the movie. And her surprising shades of grit don’t hurt, either.","80","2091935"
"15315","Even when the movie sags and strains a bit in Act III, Clooney keeps it flying with old-fashioned movie-star allure. He's got it all: Cary Grant's looks and, inside, Bob Hope's snake-oil-salesman soul.","80","138524"
"15316","It’s an engrossing, forthright adventure.","80","3450958"
"15317","It's all thoroughly adorable, and with an overlay that's nearly as odd as Carell's accent.","80","1323594"
"15318","Molly’s Game isn’t the deepest movie you’ll see, but it’s both finely tuned and big-hearted. It’s a rouser.","80","4209788"
"15319","While the helmer’s myth-making approach makes for great Capra-esque entertainment, younger auds may find it terribly old-fashioned — and they’d be right to think so, although Spielberg would be the first to admit it was his intention to play things classical.","80","3682448"
"15320","Among the sunnier, funnier films of the year, thanks largely to the zest with which Faris embodies a mental vacuum.","80","852713"
"15321","Admittedly, The Jacket is not likely to be everyone's cup of tea, but filmmaker John Maybury has forged a mesmerizing mindblower.","80","366627"
"15322","In his first English language film, Quebeçois director Denis Villeneuve has produced a masterful thriller that is also an engrossing study of a smalltown America battered by recession, fear and the unrelenting elements.","80","1392214"
"15323","Inception, though, is no ""Avatar""--instead, it’s the movie that many wanted ""Avatar"" to be. In a roaringly fast first hour, we’re introduced to a new technology that allows for the bodily invasion of another person’s dreamworld.","80","1375666"
"15324","Some elements of the film are too melodramatic, but there's not a bad performance in it -- look at the cast and that's not surprising -- and Gosling is outstanding.","80","1124035"
"15325","The film thrums with an ongoing existential dread. And yet, tellingly, Cuaron's film contains a top-note of compassion that strays at times towards outright sentimentality.","80","1454468"
"15326","The movie's beating heart is the friendship between the women, who had found some sort of happiness by the show's 2004 finale. Now they're all at a personal crossroads and need one another more than ever.","80","1000774"
"15327","If [it] doesn't feel quite as revelatory as Keep the Lights On (2012) or the heartbreaking Love Is Strange (2014), it still impresses you with its quiet, confident maturity.","80","4919484"
"15328","It's formulaic, yet edgy. It's predictable, yet full of surprises. How far you get through this tall tale of a thriller before you give up and howl is a matter of personal taste.","80","119174"
"15329","It's the perfect moment for the ridiculous but riotously enjoyable revolutionary comic-book thriller V for Vendetta-which will doubtless outrage conservatives and unnerve fuddy-duddys but liberate the rest of us with its magisterial irresponsibility.","80","434409"
"15330","Positive figures--Furious, Tre, Brandi--are rendered perhaps too virtuous, and Singleton becomes a bit preachy in the closing scenes, but an overt ""message"" movie may be the only appropriate response to the ongoing social crisis addressed.","80","101507"
"15331","Seamlessly melding Marvel mythology with Western mythology, James Mangold has crafted an affectingly stripped-down stand-alone feature, one that draws its strength from Hugh Jackman’s nuanced turn as a reluctant, all but dissipated hero.","80","3315342"
"15332","White House Down aims to be a low-brow slab of mindless summer fun. Most of the time, it comes pretty close to hitting the bull’s eye.","80","2334879"
"15333","Rebel Without a Cause has such beautiful color photography that it seems almost impossible to conceive of the fact that they initially started filming it in black and white. Dean is every bit as tormented here as he was in East of Eden, but it’s more of an existential torment this time.","80","48545"
"15334","Drag Me to Hell has a tonic playfulness that’s unabashedly retro, an indulgent return to Mr. Raimi’s goofy, gooey roots.","80","1127180"
"15335","This excruciatingly violent, three-hour Viet Nam saga demolishes the moral and ideological cliches of an era: it shoves the audience into hell and leaves it stranded without a map.","80","77416"
"15336","A film that storms where most biopics respectfully tiptoe.","80","56241"
"15337","A startling debut full of emotional depth and political punch.","80","199725"
"15338","Mud poses as a mere adolescent adventure tale but explores a rich vein of grown-up concerns, exploring codes of honor, love and family too solid to be shaken by modernizing forces.","80","1935179"
"15339","Has Gordon Gekko gone soft? The answer is, sort of -- a development that takes some of the bite out of Oliver Stone's shrewdly opportunistic, glibly entertaining sequel, which offers another surface-skimming peek inside the power corridors of global finance.","80","1027718"
"15340","Serious, topical filmmaking of a very high order. It may not engage as immediately as a Bourne, but it sticks with you longer.","80","387131"
"15341","Long but consistently engaging biopic.","80","113987"
"15342","The simplicity of the seemingly impromptu story, set largely in Allen's beloved New York City, is part of Annie Hall's undeniable charm, along with Allen's flashbacks to childhood (with side-splitting Jonathan Munk as a young Woody) and constant asides to the camera, a device that sometimes has to carry the laughs.","80","75686"
"15343","Red Eye, which is exactly eighty-five minutes long, has been made with classical technique and bravura skill, and it's leaving moviegoers in a rare state of satisfaction.","80","421239"
"15344","Star Trek V: The Final Frontier is as much a spiritual odyssey as a space adventure, and it's all the richer for it. It has high adventure, nifty special effects and much good humor, but it also has a wonderful resonance to it. [9 June 1989]","80","98382"
"15345","Darabont follows King's book fairly closely, allowing the audience to steep itself in the setting and characters slowly, like reading a good novel.","80","120689"
"15346","Bearing all the Mann hallmarks, this is visually enthralling, relentlessly stylish crime drama. A little too languorous for its own good at times, but still vastly superior entertainment.","80","430357"
"15347","Few action films can claim such complexities without conceding the bang-bang stuff that brings in the big money.","80","110413"
"15348","An innovative genre blend that overcomes its bagginess thanks to sharp character comedy and a wildly appealing central dynamic.","80","6663582"
"15349","The film is marvelous fun on its own terms -- I laughed all the way through it.","80","243133"
"15350","Not since Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg teamed up in ""The Other Guys"" has an onscreen pairing proved as comically rewarding as the inspired partnership of Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum.","80","1232829"
"15351","A big, unruly bacchanal of a movie that huffs and puffs and nearly blows its own house down, but holds together by sheer virtue of its furious filmmaking energy and a Leonardo DiCaprio star turn so electric it could wake the dead.","80","993846"
"15352","Hugely satisfying entertainment that will attract a broad spectrum of audiences around the world. Zwick fully exploits the star power at his disposal, pairing off Cruise and Japanese star Ken Watanabe as two larger-than-life warriors.","80","325710"
"15353","It's eminently suitable for children, fully inhabiting their world and finding real laughs there without resorting to sentiment, condescension, or snarky in-jokes for the adults.","80","1196141"
"15354","A biographical drama steeped equally in grace and horror, it builds to a brutal finale that will stir deep emotion and inevitable unease. But the film is perhaps even more accomplished as a theological provocation, one that grapples fearlessly with the intense spiritual convictions that drove Turner to do what he had previously considered unthinkable.","80","4196450"
"15355","There’s an authenticity underpinning the portrayal of events in The Front Runner that lifts it above the less-than-groundbreaking set-up.","80","7074886"
"15356","With its exhilarating action sequences, Walt Disney Pictures' The Rescuers Down Under challenges the adventure films of Spielberg and Lucas and confirms the special power of animation to present extravagant fantasies on screen.","80","100477"
"15357","What follows is pulp made near-profound through director Jonathan Mostow’s sure-handed guidance.","80","986263"
"15358","If the zombie genre steadfastly refuses to die, we can be grateful to Shaun of the Dead for breathing fresh, diverting life into the form, with subtle visual humor and a smart, impish sense of fun.","80","365748"
"15359","You do sense, though, that the people behind MIB3 (mainly veteran producer Walter F. Parkes and script doctor David Koepp) were smart enough to let the audience grow up a bit, enough to get the Andy Warhol jokes and one brilliantly weird creation, a delicate alien who can see every outcome at once.","80","1409024"
"15360","Raimi has not lost his knack for stylish action, and a couple of the pieces -- particularly the concluding scene in the discount department store where Ash works in the present -- are audience-rousers. [19 Feb 1993]","80","106308"
"15361","It deserves to be seen on a hot Saturday afternoon in a theater (preferably an air-conditioned one) peopled with other people, the way many of us used to see movies as kids.","80","473075"
"15362","The film is creepy, violent and sometimes very clever.","80","85636"
"15363","A finely-acted, sensitively-written tale.","80","104036"
"15364","A phenomenal, heart-breaking performance from Jeff Bridges powers this simple but affecting redemption story.","80","1263670"
"15365","The start wobbles, but once boy and dragon connect, this becomes a thrilling flight.","80","892769"
"15366","The way the allegory works out is not exactly subtle or unexpected, but is strangely moving, despite the gruesomeness that has gone before. All in all, a treat.","80","1706620"
"15367","Yes, Glazer asks a lot of his audience. At times the movie feels like something you've walked in to the middle of, so you're thrown off balance. Yet it's hypnotic — you want to stick around to see what happens, and maybe just to figure out what the hell is going on.","80","1441395"
"15368","Larraín is as good at navigating the treacherous waters of internal White House politics as he is capturing the moments of intense, if numbed, private suffering.","80","1619029"
"15369","Under the suave direction of Jonathan Frakes, who also plays the Enterprise's second-in-command, the movie glides along with purpose and style.","80","117731"
"15370","Old-fashioned as that might sound, there's a fresh, insightful feel to this multigenerational love story.","80","1570728"
"15371","This holiday contender from John Hughes is too crass, too loud and too violent to be added blithely to Christmas viewing traditions. But it is funny.","80","99785"
"15372","If ever there was a movie equivalent to the one-night stand this is it - not necessarily something you'll remember next day but fast, furious and damn good fun while it lasts.","80","106697"
"15373","Luckily, with a dash of mischief, a dollop of whimsy, and, yes, a hearty spoonful of sugar, Mary Poppins Returns manages to feel less like a cynical cash-grab and more like a visit from an old friend — even if the reality of her reappearance doesn’t quite live up to your fuzzy memories of the good ol’ days.","80","5028340"
"15374","Despite the presence of several sublimely cracked actors and some of the most abrasive white-trash caricatures since ""Raising Arizona,"" Birch totally owns this movie.","80","162346"
"15375","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a multi-layered piece with such swathes of great dialogue that it will no doubt reward - if not demand - multiple viewings. It's also another item of evidence pointing toward a filmmaker getting into his stride.","80","5027774"
"15376","Perfectly played, simultaneously serious and light, endlessly inventive, this is a strong contender for the most original date movie of the year. (Terrific) stuff.","80","1022603"
"15377","Each and every one of the movie's 125 minutes is a moment of searing truth.","80","315733"
"15378","A tender, nostalgic and warm ‘family’ drama which also quietly seethes with the threat and tension of imminent danger. Labor Day shows a new side to Jason Reitman as a filmmaker, and we like it.","80","1967545"
"15379","Start lining up now, bring a bullwhip -- and maybe some d-Con. Indiana will do the rest.","80","97576"
"15380","This is delightfully bonkers; an eerie and edgy outpouring that makes Twin Peaks look like Moonlighting.","80","116922"
"15381","Still, in its own Saturday-morning-serial kind of way, Attack of the Clones is a commendable example of the sort of movie we once loved and then outgrew. Of course, if it was even better, we wouldn't feel as if we'd outgrown it.","80","121765"
"15382","Using simplicity as another form of deception, Mamet lays out a hand of three-card monte for the audience to see, then tricks it into guessing falsely. In this case, it's worth getting fooled out of a little cash.","80","360009"
"15383","The formula may be familiar, but the personalities are completely fresh, yielding a menagerie of loveable — if downright ugly — cartoon critters banding together to help these two incompatible roommates from ending up on the streets.","80","2709768"
"15384","And then, of course, there was the music, better music than any film had had for many years.","80","80455"
"15385","Like the TV show, The X-Files movie is stylish, scary, sardonically funny and at times just plain gross.","80","120902"
"15386","Brilliantly scripted and full of a virtual Who's Who of familiar faces, The Big Lebowski is yet another golden hunk of totally unique celluloid from the versatile Brothers Cohen.","80","118715"
"15387","Pawn Sacrifice sticks admirably close to the facts of that peculiar historical moment, and features a showboat performance from Tobey Maguire as the increasingly disturbed Fischer, along with a more composed one from Liev Schreiber as the taciturn Spassky.","80","1596345"
"15388","Director John Carpenter and producer Debra Hill, the team responsible for ""Halloween"" and ""The Fog,"" have come up with another B-movie thriller whose ambitions get exceeded by respectable results. [10 July 1981, p.17]","80","82340"

"15390","Think ""Napoleon Dynamite"" and ""Little Miss Sunshine."" In many ways, Win Win fits that mold, which should make it McCarthy's most broadly appealing movie to date.","80","1606392"
"15391","A triumphant return to the icky, otherworldly eerieness that graced such earlier Cronenberg works as ""Scanners,"" ""Videodrome"" and ""Dead Ringers.""","80","120907"
"15392","If you're willing to let go of your Hollywood-bred expectations for a movie of this type-spectacular action set pieces, constant pulse-pounding music, a killing every 15 minutes-The American is a great pleasure to watch, an astringent antidote to the loud, frantic action movies that have been clogging our veins all summer.","80","1440728"
"15393","There are scenes of complete brilliance, Walken is better than he's been in years, cute plot loops and grace notes.","80","1931533"
"15394","We must salute screenwriter Budd Schulberg (his speech for priest Karl Malden in the loading bay is still stirring). Add the acting/writing heroics a restrained score by Leonard Bernstein and a striking, charcoal look by cinematographer Boris Kaufman, and you have an elegiac portrait of labour relations that feels like a kick in the slats.","80","47296"
"15395","If ""Top Gun"" was a stylish bimbo of a movie, all cleavage, white teeth and aerodynamic flash, then Days of Thunder is its paradoxical twin -- a bimbo with brains.","80","99371"
"15396","A pulsing, wooshing, visceral experience that amounts to great fun and an entirely disposable movie.","80","120611"
"15397","Smith makes it look easy, but underneath the physical high jinks and slick veneer of I, Robot lies a performance of real discipline and intelligence.","80","343818"
"15398","Boasting the sort of shocking brutality and unnerving menace that has become Saulnier’s signature, Hold the Dark is also a strangely seductive film, and one that understands the difference between simple plot resolution and catharsis, leading us on a journey into Alaska’s frigid heart of darkness that poses more questions than it answers.","80","5057140"
"15399","Granted, Freundlich has the benefit of Bier’s screenplay contributions to guide him, but in his particular execution, the story feels grounded for a very different strategy from Bier’s: Rather than going out of his way to include recognizable human moments, he strips away anything excessive, allowing subtext to surface in the quiet spaces between dialogue.","80","7985692"
"15400","A rich, understated character drama that gleefully exposes the petty playground politics at the centre of one of the internet-era's most bitter court cases.","80","1285016"
"15401","Director Harlin's only large mistake is staging the several violent deaths too authentically. They momentarily mar the high-speed implausibility of a movie that, like his Die Hard 2, agreeably combines the edgy and the genial.","80","106582"
"15402","A hilarious and deftly convincing satire.","80","105151"
"15403","This exuberantly foul-mouthed and mean-spirited comedy goes somewhat soft in the final stretch but remains an often uproarious model of sharp scripting and spirited acting.","80","2170299"
"15404","What could have been a narrow, cultish little picture, a mere retro-trip, fans out into a broader study of longing and belonging. [4 Oct 1993, p.214]","80","106677"
"15405","It's not big and it's not clever, but it's very, very funny.","80","80487"
"15406","Like Wenders's other road movies, this is largely about the spaces between people and the words they speak—Antonioni updated and infused with German romanticism; the various means of indirection through which the hero communicates with his son (Hunter Carson) and wife (Nastassja Kinski) constitute a striking motif.","80","87884"
"15407","It’s impressive and enjoyable to behold how easily Smith and Lawrence slide back into these characters and actually make them more accessible and fun to be around than before.","80","1502397"
"15408","But Evil Dead 2's rampant inventiveness and manic energy have ensured that it will endure as a cult classic.","80","92991"
"15409","It is a finely constructed drama, avoiding stuffiness without slipping into camp territory and while diehard historians might disapprove, everyone else will be supremely entertained.","80","2328900"
"15410","Bitterly funny with perfect set-piece after perfect set-piece.","80","66026"
"15411","Nurse Betty is this year's ""Being John Malkovich""-an utter original with a little something to say and a way of saying it that manages to be at once delightful and bilious.","80","171580"
"15412","A lot of the other period details aren't too firmly anchored in time, but the film is so good-natured, so obviously aware of everything it's up to, even its own picturesque frauds, that I opt to go along with it. One forgives its unrelenting efforts to charm, if only because The Sting itself is a kind of con game, devoid of the poetic aspirations that weighed down ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.""","80","70735"
"15413","David Mamet’s harsh, hard-talking drama about shady, desperate real estate salesmen makes for an actors’ showcase with a surprisingly conventional whodunit backdrop in the movie version of Glengarry Glen Ross.","80","104348"
"15414","A likable romantic comedy with an engaging premise and strong cast.","80","151738"
"15415","Crackling with energy and fizzing with ideas, this fresh take on Frankenstein is a thrilling adaptation that reinvigorates a well-worn tale.","80","1976009"
"15416","Actually, it's a childhood ""A Clockwork Orange,"" a reverent realization of the late Stanley Kubrick's final obsession.","80","212720"
"15417","If this Popsicle of a movie melts long before it's over, the first half has more good laughs than all of “Sweethearts.”","80","250494"
"15418","Waves shudders with ambition and nervy style; it never quite relaxes out of its harrowing first hour but the longer it stretches out, the more humane it feels.","80","8652728"
"15419","It's these well-lived-with characters who make The Four Seasons a pleasure to watch, and the actors obviously relish their parts. [25 May 1981, p.74]","80","82405"
"15420","Hysterically hyperbolic and unpleasant if still witty dissection of family traumas.","80","757361"
"15421","The first 10 minutes of Dee Rees's funny, moving, nuanced, and impeccably acted first feature, in which coming of age and coming out are inseparable, sharply reveal the conflicts that 17-year-old Alike (Adepero Oduye) faces.","80","1233334"
"15422","Carroll purists and freshman English majors may be aghast at the change in story, but for those who watched ""Avatar"" and marveled at the images but were left wanting by the wooden acting and tired story, ""Alice"" is a treat.","80","1014759"
"15423","A delightfully obscene alternative to the usual Christmas tosh.","80","307987"
"15424","Whether horror fans are ready for high-notes or musical buffs will appreciate Dario Argento levels of gore is an open question, but this is a rich, demented experience.","80","408236"
"15425","Sexy, slap-happy links comedy.","80","117918"
"15426","First-time helmer Jan De Bont, the ace lenser of most of Paul Verhoeven's films as well as ""Die Hard"" and numerous other large-scale pix, handles the action with great nimbleness and dexterity; film can hardly be faulted for its visual presentation of very complex action.","80","111257"
"15427","There’s a delicate intimacy between the characters that feels raw and authentic and like Coogler, Caple Jr’s indie beginnings seem to steer him toward filling a big film with small moments.","80","6343314"
"15428","With its clever, whip-smart script and enthusiastic ensemble cast firing on all cylinders, crime comedy filmmakers John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein score big with Game Night.","80","2704998"
"15429","It pretty much keeps its pulse steady, its blood cold and its nerves tamped down -- which, combined with cinematographer Remi Adefarasin's architectural Hitchcockian flourishes, lends a queasy, cool air to the proceedings.","80","416320"
"15430","Haynes’s vision of two New Yorks, a half-century apart, is a marvel of nested detail, never overbearing, and interested in things rusted and forgotten rather than shiny and new.","80","5208216"
"15431","In a genuinely brave performance, Seth Rogen sheds his frat-boy comic styling and delivers an unflinching portrayal.","80","1197628"
"15432","The action in Terminator 2 is edited for maximum suspense, and much of it is mounted on such a grand scale that little in movie history comes close. (Scenes in last summer's Die Hard 2 did, but they lacked the finesse of the new film).","80","103064"
"15433","The film holds you, in a suffocating way. Polanski never lets the story tell itself. It's all over-deliberate, mauve, nightmarish; everyone is yellow-lacquered, and evil runs rampant. You don't care who is hurt, since everything is blighted. And yet the nastiness has a look, and a fascination.","80","71315"
"15434","It's not a film that's easy to love, but like a song you at first can't stand but then end up humming all day, it works its way past your defenses and curls in close.","80","466893"
"15435","Swedish director Mikael Hafstrom creates a compelling ride of a movie. Every beat of the film is weighted with significance, and our mounting dread becomes almost intolerable.","80","450385"
"15436","A solid genre film that offers the satisfactions of the familiar while deriving its resonance through its specific and telling references to the '60s.","80","165854"
"15437","A very smart and funny movie directed by Jason Reitman, who also shrewdly adapted the screenplay from Christopher Buckley's savagely satiric novel.","80","427944"
"15438","Utterly uneasy to watch but strikingly and confidently assembled, the film is a powerful aural and visual experience that doesn’t quite manage to sustain itself over the course of its running time, but is a remarkable — and remarkably intense — experience nonetheless.","80","3808342"
"15439","Fans of David Gordon Green, you may well leave feeling confused. Fans of daft laughs and James Franco, you're in for one of the funniest comedies of the year.","80","910936"
"15440","Misfit cameos, apparently random asides and an almost continuous onslaught of unsettling sex and violence mean there’s no mistaking David Lynch’s hand behind the camera -- but there’s enough of a narrative to make this work as a straightforward road movie, too.","80","100935"
"15441","Director Joe (Gremlins) Dante delivers some terrific spine-tingling chills on the way towards a disappointingly overblown climax.","80","1085779"
"15442","The idea is that the guys' adventure proves transformative, but Tucker's dramatic I've-seen-the-light speech is charged with just the right degree of glibness to leave one skeptical.","80","1220628"
"15443","Confident and brash, Lagaan may be high-concept New Bollywood, but it plays like well-crafted Old Hollywood.","80","169102"
"15444","May be a shade too serious and contemplative to completely enchant the thrill-seeking masses, while simultaneously seeming too mainstream-minded and genre-bound to be entirely embraced by highbrows.","80","181689"
"15445","Tender Mercies has a bleak handsomeness bordering on the arty, but it also has real delicacy and emotional power, both largely attributable to a fine performance by Robert Duvall.","80","86423"
"15446","Smashing for much of the way; as a piece of fantasy moviemaking, franchise-style, it beats the bejesus out of ""Harry Potter.""","80","120737"
"15447","For anyone who doesn't think an hour and a half is a long time to spend with a comic book, Heavy Metal is impressive. Though it owes some slight bit of its toughness and nihilism to Ralph Bakshi, this animated feature is off on its own track, combining science fiction, mysticism, sex, violence and rock music. Much of the time, these elements do what the film makers want them to, and make for a heady mix.","80","82509"
"15448","“A person’s a person, no matter how small,” Dr. Seuss once memorably counselled – and that’s as good a binding philosophy as any for Alexander Payne’s exhilaratingly odd new film.","80","1389072"
"15449","What’s onscreen is less a cerebral experience than a stirring and bittersweet love story, inflected with tasteful good humor, that can’t help but recall earlier disability dramas like “My Left Foot” and “The Diving Bell and the Butterfly.”","80","2980516"
"15450","Paul Thomas Anderson shows off the same sort of quirky smarts that Joel and Ethan Coen did in ""Blood Simple.""","80","119256"
"15451","Most crucially, Brosnan makes the grade as 007. He handles the action capably and gets the standard quips out in a commendably straightforward way that's wry but not dismissive.","80","113189"
"15452","Kirk & Co return to present-day San Francisco to save the whales in the most enjoyable film of the series so far, also returning to the simplistic morality-play format that gave the original TV series its strength.","80","92007"
"15453","Another of the film's positive aspects is its narrative style, reminiscent of Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon.","80","335563"
"15454","A richly nuanced American comedy, with two acting talents working at their absolute peak.","80","775529"
"15455","Brisk and involving with a streamlined forward propulsion, it's the kind of superhero movie we want if we have to have superhero movies at all.","80","290334"
"15456","A nutty, zany, wacky, unruly, spastically hilarious hodgepodge that hits at least twice as often as it misses—which is a big deal, since there are more gags per square foot of celluloid than in any film since Joe Dante's ""Gremlins 2: The New Batch"" (1990).","80","318155"
"15457","The film benefits from Pugh’s charismatic performance and writer-director Stephen Merchant’s cheery mixture of crowd-pleasing sentiment, wry laughs and genuine sweetness.","80","6513120"
"15458","With an actor only slightly more expressive than Ryan O'Neal in the lead, this sombre costume epic might have reached the level of tragedy; as it is, the film is langorous to a fault, but so visually delightful and keenly observed that its excesses demand forgiveness.","80","72684"
"15459","You'd need a heart of stone not to be won over by Wadjda, a rebel yell with a spoonful of sugar and a pungent sense of a Riyadh society split between the home, the madrasa and the shopping mall.","80","2258858"
"15460","Grounded by strong performances by newcomers Featherston and Sloat, who pretty much have the movie to themselves, Paranormal Activity, which demands to be seen in a crowded theater, is refreshingly blood-free.","80","1179904"
"15461","Made with all the awareness of hindsight, Shampoo offers a sharp sexual satire and a mature statement on both America and Hollywood in 1968.","80","73692"
"15462","This is a timeless thriller, a reminder of how stars who have been so average elsewhere can produce excellent — some career-best — work when given a decent script and a confident director.","80","104257"
"15463","Perhaps the best premise for thrills since ""Speed,"" only this time the bad guy’s on board and the battle of wits is more philosophical debate than pop quiz.","80","369339"
"15464","Coolly absorbing without being pulse-quickening.","80","373926"
"15465","Gattaca, New Zealander helmer Andrew Niccol's impressive feature debut, is an intelligent and timely sci-fi thriller that, with the exception of some illogical plot contrivances, is emotionally engaging almost up to the end.","80","119177"
"15466","This may have its occasional dull stretches, but in contrast to ""Saving Private Ryan"" it's the work of a grown-up with something to say about the meaning and consequences of war.","80","120863"
"15467","The Lost Boys is to horror movies what ''Late Night With David Letterman'' is to television; it laughs at the form it embraces, adds a rock-and-roll soundtrack and, if you share its serious-satiric attitude, manages to be very funny.","80","93437"
"15468","It holds the attention of the audience from brazen start to fantastic finish – well, not quite to the silly end, perhaps, but then we can’t have everything.","80","58150"
"15469","At barely 80 minutes, the film seems like a slight little adventure, but Fleischer fleshes out his twists and turns to make it feel like a fully-rendered story.","80","1622547"
"15470","It does what all great horror movies do: turn real-world anxieties into the stuff of nightmares.","80","5052448"
"15471","There’s no cutting away from the disturbing in Midsommar (in fact, the camera prefers to push into the worst of it); you will look at this, and you will see the violence that is life and death, the movie says.","80","8772262"
"15472","This may be the most truly disturbing movie to come along sinceLynch's Blue Velvet of 1986...But for those who are willing to go the distance with Lynch, the return trip to Twin Peaks is well worth the trouble. [31 Aug 1992]","80","105665"
"15473","Sweeping and powerful drama of the American frontier, Stagecoach displays potentialities that can easily drive it through as one of the surprise big grossers of the year. Without strong marquee names, picture nevertheless presents wide range of exploitation to attract, and will carry far through word-of-mouth after it gets rolling.","80","31971"
"15474","Simply stated, it is difficult not to be swept up by this charming picture.","80","93565"
"15475","A perversely fascinating movie--one that answers no questions, offers no hope and has little meaning. In a way this is perfect for what the film has to say about war, but you find yourself numbed and apathetic as the film progresses.","80","93058"
"15476","Passengers is as surprisingly traditional as it is undeniably effective. A timeless romance wedded to a space-age survival thriller, it may be a curious coupling but Tyldum’s Turing follow-up is a journey well worth taking.","80","1355644"
"15477","Mr. Clark's vision of these characters is so bleak and legitimately shocking that it makes almost any other portrait of American adolescence look like the picture of Dorian Gray...Kids is far too serious to be tarred as exploitation, and its extremism is both artful and devastatingly effective. Think of this not as cinema verite but as a new strain of post-apocalyptic science fiction, using hyperbole to magnify a kernel of terrible, undeniable truth.","80","113540"
"15478","Full of committed performances, particularly from Elba and the impressive young actor Abraham Attah, Beasts Of No Nation is a project of considerable integrity which makes for a consistently-engrossing, if over-long, viewing experience.","80","1365050"
"15479","Day of the Dead has a less startling setting, since most of it takes place underground. But it still affords Mr. Romero the opportunity for intermittent philosophy and satire, without compromising his reputation as the grisliest guy around.","80","88993"
"15480","In short, Bound is admittedly derivative, but it's such an amusing low-down entertainment it really doesn't matter.","80","115736"
"15481","It all adds up to a compelling, deftly executed film that thoughtfully examines the actions and motivations that draw people together, directing their uneasy relationships.","80","119822"
"15482","Beautifully done, I think, with a completely appropriate and consistent style.","80","67959"
"15483","At its best, which it frequently is, it's a lunatic ball, an extremely genial, witty example of what is becoming a movie genre all its own.","80","86856"
"15484","It’s easily the best movie of the summer so far. Sony has obviously given Raimi more freedom to run the show, and the results are very entertaining.","80","316654"
"15485","The best cheap thrill to come out of Hollywood in ages -- it's a shot of tonic for the current blockbuster bloat.","80","232500"
"15486","Don't you expect any hand-holding, either. Director David Yates throws us straight into Harry's waking nightmare, as he searches for a way to defeat Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) while keeping himself and his friends alive.","80","926084"
"15487","So intriguing are the driven, smart and compromised characters, and so infinite are the dramatic possibilities at the intersection of big business and politics, that a vastly expanded small-screen take built around these characters, and others like them, would be quite welcome..","80","4540710"
"15488","It's Kind of a Funny Story is kind of a perfect coming-of-age comedy, with its bittersweet fun set loose in the adult psych ward of a Brooklyn hospital where this clever case of teenage depression, identity and self-esteem is examined.","80","804497"
"15489","Occasionally heavy-handed and overdone -- and scarcely free from a self-congratulatory tone -- this latest spoof is nonetheless lots of fun, clever and fearless, and loaded with wicked lines and touches.","80","157503"
"15490","The movie of the season for sci-fi and horror fans.","80","134847"
"15491","Another year, another Mike Leigh gem.","80","1431181"
"15492","The Leisure Seeker is dry-eyed even at its most moving and a celebration of love even as it reaches its end.","80","3741632"
"15493","Merhige understands how exciting going to the edge of credibility can be without falling off, and he has the bravura talent and imagination needed to pull off the sheer, hurtling audacity of Suspect Zero.","80","324127"
"15494","Chris Hemsworth gives a breakout performance as fallen Norse god.","80","800369"
"15495","A sweet-natured, high-spirited comedy, that rare movie that plays effectively to all ages. Even rarer, it celebrates genuine sportsmanship, placing the emphasis back on how the game is played in the face of the winning-is-everything philosophy that permeates every aspect of contemporary life. [1 Oct 1993, p.F4]","80","106611"
"15496","The stylish irreverence of Trainspotting mimics that drug high and delivers its own potent kick.","80","117951"
"15497","Young Adult might be brushed off as curdled rom-com were it not for two things. The first is the depth of Theron's performance...The second, less predictable aspect is the utter absence of the corny rehabilitation found in ""Juno"" and Reitman's glib, downsizing dramedy ""Up in the Air.""","80","1625346"
"15498","Whiplash scrapes the far edge of crazy passion. It never apologizes.","80","2582802"
"15499","The production is as clean and effective as Red October herself; there's not one dial or glowing radar screen too many; the underwater hits and near-misses are clearly choreographed and the undersea intensity is captured perfectly by Jan De Bont's camera work. [2 Mar 1990, Calendar, p.F-1]","80","99810"
"15500","You wanna feel all right? This is the holiday movie that will do it.","80","58182"
"15501","A nightmarish triptych of loss, waste and grief that is nonetheless arranged with such visionary boldness that it dares us to look away.","80","6896536"
"15502","And while more than 30 writers worked on the screenplay and untold numbers labored to re-create the ambiance and effects that the animators once tossed off with a few squiggles of their pencils, The Flintstones doesn't feel overcalculated, over-produced or overthought.","80","109813"
"15503","If I seem cool, it might be because I came in hoping for the same level of blood-and-thunder as in the Evangelical scenes of ""There Will Be Blood,"" whereas The Master is a cerebral experience. But Anderson has gone about exploring fundamental tensions in the American character with more discipline than I once thought him capable.","80","1560747"
"15504","This showcase for the talents of Jim Carrey is adroitly directed, viscerally and visually dynamic and just plain fun.","80","110475"
"15505","Whew! It’s shocking - a horror film but extremely well done by producer Jerome Hellman and John Schlesinger, the British director who uncannily captures the feeling for tragedy in this locale, the forced gaiety of some who have sunk to the lower depths of despair and sympathy for the two disillusioned protagonists.","80","64665"
"15506","Silly, sophomoric, and slapped together, but would you want it any other way?","80","71853"
"15507","A stirring black-empowerment tale aimed squarely at white audiences, The Help personalizes the civil rights movement through the testimony of domestic servants working in Jackson, Miss., circa 1963.","80","1454029"
"15508","Back to the Future deserved a chance to come back, especially under the cheerful, enterprising, mathematically minded stewardship of Mr. Zemeckis and Mr. Gale. Their new film isn't an ordinary sequel. It's as if the earlier film had been squared.","80","96874"
"15509","This is real edge-of-your-seat stuff, in a throwback way - no booming special effects, just old-school timing and execution.","80","1226753"
"15510","A surprisingly good-natured comedy.","80","151804"
"15511","As much Tolkien's baby as Mignola's, this has more heart and humour than most fantasy films can dream of. Hellaciously good.","80","411477"
"15512","Adoring fans of the original will surely not be disappointed. Disney have cast their magic spell once again, creating a modern romantic fable with lavish visuals and wickedly entertaining performances.","80","2771200"
"15513","Alfonso Cuarón returns to his childhood for inspiration with the meticulously beautiful Roma, an autobiographical black and white thank you letter full of warmth and love.","80","6155172"
"15514","Comedy is used to undercut the most horribly tragic of moments...given the sadness all the more pathos and offering glimpses of hope in a narrative resistant to catharsis.","80","4034228"
"15515","Coppola tells the story with terrific gusto and insouciant wit, tying together images from the first scene and the last, so that the narrative satisfyingly snaps shut.","80","5592248"
"15516","A sharp-witted, visually layered, gorgeously designed, meticulously directed piece of formula pablum.","80","120382"
"15517","After a while, you adjust, or rather, you get tired of probing the slightly-off evidence of your eyes and the headache it produces. There’s a lot of fun to distract you.","80","1302006"
"15518","Alien 3 belongs to that branch of fantasy comics, best exemplified by the ""Road Warrior"" movies, in which the iron and space ages meet for dizzy results.","80","103644"
"15519","A feature film that's often astringent on the surface, yet deeply and memorably stirring.","80","491747"
"15520","While not to everyone's tastes, this is without doubt one of the most exhilarating films of 1994.","80","110074"
"15521","First Reformed doesn’t come off as pastiche, or a raking-up of old ideas – largely because Schrader and his cast commit to the project with sharpened and unblinking seriousness, even when the going gets mesmerically weird.","80","6053438"
"15522","If you thought the sweetness of The Straight Story was unprecedented in Lynchs work, look again at this earlier true-life tale of odd, everyday heroism.","80","80678"
"15523","An uproarious display of brilliance, nerve, dance, maudlin confessions, inside jokes and, especially, ego.","80","78754"
"15524","This is a warmer, less foreboding picture than ""Primer,"" not moving in any conventional sense, but suffused with emotion all the same.","80","2084989"
"15525","If you love the Coens, or follow folk music, or hold fast to this period of history and that patch of New York, then the film can hardly help striking a chord.","80","2042568"
"15526","If that all sounds like a lot of good, clean fun, a word of warning. In what seems to have become the genre's raison d'etre, the dialogue is so blue at times that you'll probably feel the heat of the blushing cheeks on either side of you, especially whenever Reilly's fast-talking savant of smut shows up.","80","1477837"

"15530","As before, much of the dialog neatly walks the line between true wit and silly (and sometimes inside) jokes.","80","82474"
"15531","If Saroo’s story seems out-of-this world, the team behind this film have risen to meet the challenge it sets. There may be a sense of inevitability about Saroo’s ultimate destination, but what counts here is the journey.","80","3741834"
"15532","If you get half of the jokes flung your way, and laugh at half of those you’re still in much better shape than the very best episode of Three’s Company. If you truly study this movie and love it all, you probably haven’t done much with your life, but at least you’re smiling.","80","80339"

"15534","Genuinely gripping, Demi makes an awesome femme fatale.","80","109635"
"15535","Scripted by Steve Tesich, it's Yates' best film since The Friends of Eddie Coyle and displays the kind of unsentimental optimism that went out of fashion with Hawks.","80","78902"
"15536","Based on Alice Hoffman's fanciful novel and directed with go-for-broke prettiness by Griffin Dunne, Practical Magic is nothing but a guilty pleasure.","80","120791"
"15537","This meticulously designed and directed debut feature from writer-director Jennifer Kent (expanded from her award-winning short, “Monster”) manages to deliver real, seat-grabbing jolts while also touching on more serious themes of loss, grief and other demons that can not be so easily vanquished.","80","2321549"
"15538","Yes, we've seen it all before. But The Relic proves that the hoariest cliches, when stirred together with enough money, shaken vigorously and artfully lighted, can still make the adrenaline surge.","80","120004"
"15539","Her Smell is a berserker infused a mad poetry. In her third film with Perry, following ""Listen Up,"" ""Phillip and Queen of the Earth,"" Moss takes a character who makes Courtney Love look like Mother Teresa and exposes the shards of humanity that once vitalized and defined her music. The effect is shattering.","80","7942742"
"15540","Wise and respectful of its audience, ""Cloudy"" thus never stops the fun.","80","844471"
"15541","Koepp does a masterful job of grounding his intimations of the supernatural in a totally persuasive down-to-earth context.","80","164181"
"15542","In purely cinematic terms, Buried, set in late 2006, is an ingenious exercise in sustained tension that would make Alfred Hitchcock turn over in his grave.","80","1462758"
"15543","As a film, Testament of Youth glimmers with sadness, but also the apprehension of sadness: we know not all of these boys are coming back.","80","1441953"
"15544","The movie feels like a Sunday drive with your own thoughts, where you get some good thinking done, even if you don’t come to any lasting conclusions.","80","2837574"
"15545","Cooper and Lawrence could so easily have stumbled over the logistical bumps and clichés strewn across Russell's defiantly dark script. Instead, they glide right over them, creating an edgy romantic dramedy that suits our anxious times.","80","1045658"
"15546","In any case, it works: Coco’s creators clearly had the perfect ending in mind before they’d nailed down all the other details, and though the movie drags in places, and features a few too many childish gags...the story’s sincere emotional resolution earns the sobs it’s sure to inspire.","80","2380307"
"15547","Interesting depiction with a pretty decent performance from Holden and supported by a credible cast.","80","46359"
"15548","Definitely lives up to its promise of being smashing, groovy, baby.","80","118655"
"15549","Keaton plays Kroc as a man both pathetic and singularly possessed, cannily resisting lovability at every turn, while delivering the internalized self-help speak of his sales pitches with chillingly glib precision.","80","4276820"
"15550","Saulnier’s ability to take a well-trodden road and fill it with grisly surprises is quite something.","80","4062536"
"15551","Solitary Man is funny and absorbing, and it features a lead performance by Michael Douglas that's both hugely entertaining in itself, and fascinating for the way it illuminates the actor's long, colorful career.","80","1294213"
"15552","A powerful Christian parable, painful but illuminating, about crime and redemption.","80","831884"
"15553","A superior, haunting thriller of abduction, deception and ethical dilemma with a sobering ending - a moral quandary that demands strong debate outside the cinema.","80","452623"

"15555","Easily one of the most dynamic cinematic portraits of that decaying, vibrant, impossible city ever made; it treats the city itself as a character.","80","1433810"
"15556","Though Living in Oblivion may sound like a one-joke movie, the pleasure of the endeavor is that it has no trouble holding your interest without feeling repetitive. Mark it down to the excellence of the acting, including the smallest roles, and the amusing and accurate way the ambience of bargain-basement filmmaking is captured.","80","113677"
"15557","At last Dreamworks has given us the stuff of nightmare.","80","298130"
"15558","Watching John Woo's The Killer may be like eating popcorn, but it's not just any old brand; it's escape-velocity popcorn, popcorn with a slurp of rocket fuel. Its story is a collision of exuberant pulp, samurai mythology and modern, urban noir.","80","97202"
"15559","Made with energetic flair and no small dose of violence, mercifully handled with discretion, Hostage exemplifies taut, confident filmmaking.","80","340163"

"15561","After its clichéd first scene - a solo LAPD officer battling a well-armed gang of thugs - Street Kings becomes an enjoyably tough, blood-splattered action drama that revolves around the one good cop at its center.","80","421073"
"15562","As beige as an old PC, but beneath the surface the blood pumps bright scarlet. An intelligent and emotionally charged spy drama.","80","1770734"
"15563","Bad Teacher is a worthy successor to the benchmark black comedy ""Bad Santa"" (without being at all the same).","80","1284575"
"15564","Daft as a badger sandwich and twice as funny, this is vintage Waititi, and the boldest, most outrageously fun film Marvel has yet produced.","80","3501632"
"15565","A fanboy's dream come true, a smart take on a smart comic that actually looks the part, with performances that make it worth watching for the rest of us, too.","80","446029"
"15566","The Producers is so effusively inappropriate and so damned funny it is one of the highest examples of low comedy.","80","63462"
"15567","A young Jennifer Jason Leigh is exceptional, and Judge Reinhold provides a solid central character that nearly everyone in the film relates to.","80","83929"
"15568","Streep and Eastwood's chemistry makes the film.","80","112579"
"15569","The film's real strength is its cast, from an Oscar-bound Mo'Nique to a notably deglammed Mariah Carey.","80","929632"
"15570","Playing a character rooted in his own background, and surrounded by the real-life members of his Minneapolis-based musical 'family,' rock star Prince makes an impressive feature film debut in Purple Rain, a rousing contemporary addition to the classic backstage musical genre.","80","87957"
"15571","Berg, who wrote and directed, is more interested in how men deal with battle than the ideals or the politics that put them there. What the movie achieves, with a gruesome energy and a remarkable reality, is a firefight.","80","1091191"
"15572","A spirited, irreverent and hugely fun comedy.","80","1981677"
"15573","Claudel turns out to be very good at the psychology of intimacy. An observant man, he has assembled a large (and, to us, unknown) cast of actors around his star, and he dramatizes her slow reawakening with an infinite number of small, sharply etched details.","80","1068649"
"15574","Once you commit to the lexicon – to the blunderbusses, the silver, the loops that close and the loops let run – you're in for a breathless ride. It's been a patchy summer for sci-fi, absent of anything that really sticks in the mind. Johnson's deep, distinctive film plays on repeat.","80","1276104"
"15575","The movie is so entertaining it hardly seems right to say it's susceptible to holes being picked in it, but it is.","80","82971"
"15576","It hasn’t anything as genuinely emotionally devastating as Up, or the subtlety and inspired subversion of Monsters Inc. and the Toy Stories which it certainly resembles at various stages. But it is certainly a terrifically likeable, ebullient and seductive piece of entertainment, taken at full-throttle.","80","2096673"
"15577","Directed by Lee Tamahori with his customary flash and glitter, Next lives from one brilliantly executed chase sequence to the next, which is more than enough reason to stay the course.","80","435705"
"15578","The movie’s story is conventional in shape, but it has passages of crazy exhilaration and brilliant invention.","80","1226229"
"15579","All of that combines to make Colombiana into a scandalous blend of action, sex and violence. My apologies in advance for having so much fun.","80","1657507"
"15580","The film stumbles a bit towards the end (some deeply rooted conflicts are implausibly resolved), but terrific performances from a large cast -- particularly Elizabeth Pena as Sam's childhood sweetheart -- smooth over the rough spots.","80","116905"
"15581","As intoxicating as the flower it's named for, and its characters, most of them as flawed and fascinating as the film itself, seem intoxicated by the overpowering scent.","80","175880"
"15582","It's an hilarious, touching reminder that, sometimes, ordinary folk have the world's most interesting lives.","80","305206"
"15583","The chief reason that we feel generous toward the film is Bullock herself. She tickles. All the others are good, especially Pullman and Gallagher, but she's the one we want to spend time with. [22 May 1995, Pg.28]","80","114924"
"15584","A breathless, exciting family movie with a couple of truly memorable sequences, and just enough in the way of story and character to keep the franchise going for another 20 years.","80","120915"
"15585","But it's essentially a tour de force for Pacino, and he sustains us through the slow passages by working with a closed-in intensity that turns each scene into a kind of mini-movie complete with its own ticking time bomb. [23Dec1992 Pg. 1]","80","105323"
"15586","A solid and satisfying commercial venture with more than enough pizazz to overcome occasional lapses in moment-to-moment plausibility.","80","120660"
"15587","John G. Avildsen is back in the Rocky ring with The Karate Kid. More precisely, it is a Rocky for kids. Morita is simply terrific, bringing the appropriate authority and wisdom to the part.","80","87538"
"15588","Full of surprising warmth and charm, unexpected plot turns and droll characters that bounce off each other in refreshing ways.","80","115734"
"15589","As before, Lee's acute observation distils humour from accuracy rather than caricature but his growth as a filmmaker is impressive.","80","97216"
"15590","The film's flamboyant portrait of Nino may be stereotypical, but Mr. Snipes makes it chilling.","80","102526"
"15591","One of those half-straight, half-spoof comic-book extravaganzas that don't ever work, and what's neat is that this one does--beautifully.","80","132347"
"15592","A poignant reflection on what it means to be alive and, visually, a true cinematic experience.","80","401383"
"15593","Sharp, very funny, surprisingly moving and rejoicing in great work from the entire cast, this sparkling little gem takes the family road movie to unhoped-for heights of hilarity and humanity.","80","449059"
"15594","Peckinpah's own control of the escalating frenzy is masterly; this is one of his coldest films, but a great thriller.","80","68638"
"15595","Kaminski, who is as good as any cinematographer working today, matches the chromatic tones of shots to their content in ways that can only be called exciting.","80","407304"
"15596","The movie crackles with the serio-comic tension of thin-skinned New Yorkers thrown together in a crisis.","80","454848"
"15597","A garishly macabre vision of a Britain exiting the war years and trying to come of age, it presents a time when society was ridding itself of the shackles of its Best-Of-British conventions, and forging a new path. Sadly though, with any coming of age tale there are those who are unable to grow at the same rate. Withnail is one of those, too happy to take all the pleasures, and never wake up to reality.","80","94336"
"15598","Soderbergh won't hit the Oscar jackpot with Ocean's Eleven, but he has come up with a stylish winner.","80","240772"
"15599","Not particularly funny, or even very sunny, but it is Charlie Kaufman’s first whole screenplay, and as wonderful as it is weird.","80","338013"
"15600","Though the sheer scope of the material overwhelms “Pariah” director Dee Rees at times, she finds shoots of optimism among the mire that couldn’t be more welcome at a moment when the country seems more divided than ever.","80","2396589"
"15601","For sheer urbane elegance coupled with technical mastery and lush, old-fashioned élan, no one working for the studios today comes close to the versatile Soderbergh.","80","349903"
"15602","Hawaiian waves crash over a high-calibre Hollywood prestige drama, sharp and sobering, with top-drawer work from Lancaster, Clift and Sinatra.","80","45793"
"15603","There's an amazing display of acting talent, even though director Lumet doesn't quite tie all the strands together.","80","74958"
"15604","Provocative, principled and richly detailed, this is compelling stuff. Emotionally it’s a little dry, but as brain-food, it’s absolutely invigorating.","80","433383"
"15605","The rainbow connection is a smooth, unbroken arch.","80","1204342"
"15606","He [Caton-Jones] has made the film all of a piece, making sure that the three lead performances complement rather than overwhelm each other. [9 Apr 1993, p.F1]","80","108330"
"15607","Cities engulfed by rolling walls of flame, sinister aquamarine power blasts turning beloved national monuments to toast, even the roiling clouds the spaceships appear out of, they are all disturbing, unsettling and completely convincing.","80","116629"
"15608","A spare, creepily atmospheric psychological thriller with a death grip on the psychological aspect.","80","482606"
"15609","The sparse story of the struggle of the two men with their obsessions, and with each other, skillfully creates a mood that is hard to shake after the ending credits. The car chases are breathtaking.","80","77474"
"15610","[An] engaging tearjerker.","80","94715"
"15611","It’s a slight film at times but one that builds to a crescendo of emotion.","80","8637428"
"15612","Slight but lively sequel. Aimed squarely at moppets with piddling attention spans.","80","243585"
"15613","They're all rather deliciously far-fetched stories but fun to watch. And the demented camera angles and fast pacing makes the tales far more unsettling than you might imagine.","80","68230"
"15614","It is all ridiculously enjoyable, because the smirking and the quips and the gadgets have been cut back - and the emotion and wholesome sado-masochism have been pumped up.","80","381061"
"15615","While this is unquestionably an issue film, it tackles its subject with intelligence and heart.","80","8267604"
"15616","This is - gasp! - a Hollywood movie actually daring to bare its teeth at silly American flag-waving.","80","115956"
"15617","The fitful development of the script aside, the movie is dominated entirely by Freeman and Tandy, who manage to retain individual star-quality while acknowledging the other's presence.","80","97239"
"15618","The big difference between Mr. Romero's film and Mr. Eisner's--which is so intelligent you fear the fanboys will scatter--is that Mr. Eisner never gives us the military's point of view. All we know is what David and Judy and Russell know, which for a long time isn't much. And The Crazies is all the scarier for it.","80","455407"
"15619","At times deeply insightful, at others wholly crass, Rolling Thunder is a fascinating curio, the meeting point between realism and exploitation.","80","76637"
"15620","Spicer has a deft touch with his story, and his cast marvelously fleshes out a bunch of people we care about even though, in most cases, we know we probably shouldn’t.","80","5962210"
"15621","Orson Welles' portrait of the friend, Harry Lime, is a study of corruption - evil, witty, unreachable.","80","41959"
"15622","A movie of shadows and half lights, the best approximation of the old black-and-white noir look anyone has yet managed on color stock.","80","119488"
"15623","[A] touching, insightful and, at the end of the day, extremely well-meaning film.","80","3062976"
"15624","Overlong at about 175 minutes (played without intermission), and occasionally confusing. While never so placid as to be boring, it is never so gripping as be superior screen drama.","80","68646"
"15625","Its generic attributes (and title) notwithstanding, Scott's film may be the sharpest of all the post-9/11 thrillers--and also the most purely entertaining--in the way it maps the vectors and currents of the modern intelligence-gathering game without losing us in its dense narrative thicket.","80","758774"
"15626","Arguably the best teen comedy since Clueless, it's easy to give this one an A. Well, A-.","80","1282140"
"15627","Tornatore may have hit a sticky wicket with his subsequent work, but he knew what he was doing here: warning us about the irrational lure of the filmed past, which is to say cinema itself, then ushering us grandly to our seats.","80","95765"
"15628","Spelling may not be Quentin Tarantino’s forte, but his grasp of language (both verbal and visual) is peerless.","80","361748"
"15629","There's a sense of beauty and dread that's cleverly injected into George Lucas' American Graffiti, a tone poem and ode to the music, cars and culture of the early '60s. On one level, the film is a staggeringly thoughtful slice of Americana – one night in the eyes of several young teens looking for love, adventure and fun. But on another level, there's a genuine sense of apprehension. The world is quickly catching up to our heroes, and soon they'll be flung head-first into Vietnam, the hippie movement, and a social revolution","80","69704"
"15630","Polanski, wisely, doesn't interpret or explain. He seems to have decided that in the face of such meticulously planned horror, the best one can do is get the details right.","80","253474"
"15631","The Aeronauts achieves impressive elevation as a bracing and sympathetic account of two early and very different aviators who together reached literal new heights in a perilous field of endeavor.","80","6141246"
"15632","Much will be said about Gray’s cinematic craft (as is often the case when a director works with cinematographer Darius Khondji) but beneath the slow roll down the river pierced by arrows from unseen, defensive natives, there’s a fascinating, mercurial screenplay that offers just enough to keep you journeying for more insight.","80","1212428"
"15633","Sentimental, overbearing, flag-waving--and a crowd-pleaser.","80","187393"
"15634","It's Bacon's astonishing performance that is a quiet, challenging and ultimately discomfortingly human voice.","80","361127"
"15635","Modern cynicism and efficient acting hold the potential mushiness at bay, and the pair's picaresque odyssey through the Kansas dustbowl, during which they vie for control over their increasingly bizarre partnership, is admirably served by Laszlo Kovacs' marvellous monochrome camerawork.","80","70510"
"15636","Never managing to look more hi-tech or further on from 1987 than, well, Hi-tech trainers, this Arnie vehicle still runs it's bloody course without dropping many gears. A brainless, breathless thrill.","80","93894"
"15637","Fresh, funny, exquisitely bittersweet tour de force.","80","211915"
"15638","The script also happens to be quite literate and laceratingly funny, and Damon -- no big surprise here -- turns out to be the perfect actor to deliver Will's zingers.","80","119217"
"15639","Full of astonishments, not the least of which are its ideas.","80","320661"
"15640","A funny and tender drawn-from-life love story.","80","5462602"
"15641","The result is a visual treasure that successfully blends deadpan quirkiness with a wry realism rarely seen in any film, let alone one for children.","80","432283"
"15642","This doesn't have the high style that made Taxi Driver or American Gigolo instant cultural icons - although Schrader shows more than a few traces of Scorsese as his camera creeps- perhaps because it's concerned with a chilly 90s that looks back with a sort of nostalgia on the cocaine-fuelled craziness of earlier years. But it does develop powerfully the themes of Schrader's earlier work and will not disappoint his fans.","80","102307"
"15643","No movie could capture all the alarming incidents and contradictions that make up the complete N.W.A. story. But in order to stress the group’s most righteous side, the movie downplays their youthful excesses as well as their flagrant sexism.","80","1398426"
"15644","Carrie is a modest but effective shock-suspense drama about a pubescent girl, her evangelical mother and cruel schoolmates. Stephen King's novel, adapted by Lawrence D. Cohen, combines in unusual fashion a lot of offbeat story angles.","80","74285"
"15645","Despite all the boobs, The Change-Up is very fair to its female characters-well, at least to Mann and Wilde, who both ring true, even if Wilde is almost too good to be true...It sounds like a trifling detail, but those details are sorely missing from most ""date movies,"" in which even the women laughing in the audience exit feeling like they're the butt of the joke.","80","1488555"
"15646","Four bombed-out astronauts journey endlessly through the galaxy, whiling away the time with jokes, sunlamp treatment, personal diaries on videotape, and games with their own pet alien. Sheer delight.","80","69945"
"15647","The film's mix of romance and reading matter is seductive in its own right, providing comfy book-lined settings and people who are what they read and write.","80","128853"
"15648","It's clever, vulgar and fully committed to making us howl with laughter. If only all sequels were this much fun.","80","289848"
"15649","To top it all off, no matter where you sit in the theater, no matter how far you arch back in your seat, there's no escaping the sensation that all the action on the screen is taking place about three feet from your face. I loved it.","80","295701"
"15650","At the heart of it all is an entrancing lead performance by the teenage Kilcher.","80","402399"
"15651","It’s quite a story, which Berlinger moves along with unrelenting energy.","80","2481498"
"15652","In the Loop is no precious show dog. It's a snarling, frothing little beastie straining at its leash.","80","1226774"
"15653","Cruise is at the top of his form, and Gooding makes a brilliant opponent.","80","116695"
"15654","The picture has a good shock or two up its sleeve before getting to Laurie's armored, booby-trapped home, and once it's there, it surprises us again.","80","1502407"
"15655","Smith makes it crackle, with various aggressive honesties and wit. [May 5, 1997}","80","118842"
"15656","Rough around the edges, it's humor decidedly sophomoric in parts. But that's part of its charm. [19 Jan 1995, p.A16(E)]","80","109445"
"15657","Forget the heavy stuff. This monkey shines.","80","133152"
"15658","Macy hasn’t had a role this good since Fargo, and demonstrates again his mastery of the droopy-eyed, apologetically desperate, borderline bitter shrug.","80","318374"
"15659","[Huston] brings a vital conviction to her scenes; they're scorchingly immediate, and her ability to get in sync with what Lily's feeling is what gives the movie weight. She may be the best we have.","80","99703"
"15660","Not one of Scorsese's greatest films; it doesn't use the camera to reveal the psychological and aesthetic dimensions of an entire world, as ""Mean Streets,"" ""Taxi Driver,"" ""Raging Bull,"" and ""Goodfellas"" did. But it's a viciously merry, violent, high-wattage entertainment, and speech is the most brazenly flamboyant element in it.","80","407887"
"15661","It may not scale the heights of Heat or The Insider, but this is riveting stuff and reconfirms Mann's status as a master of the medium.","80","248667"
"15662","The whole movie, of course, is a setting for its jewel, Catalina Sandino Moreno as Maria: With her clear, round eyes, long dark hair, and radiant transparency, she brings to mind two of the loveliest ingénues of the last quarter-century -- Meg Tilly and Jennifer Connelly.","80","390221"
"15663","2012 isn't a bad movie that, out of sheer boredom, you might snicker at once or twice; it's a two-and-a-half hour laugh riot that plays on our expectations of the genre by anticipating and exceeding them.","80","1190080"
"15664","Allen has infused it with wit, a superb cast and his usual ""the best direction is the least direction"" style.","80","91167"
"15665","All in all, Spielberg has come up with another rousing piece of entertainment.","80","87469"
"15666","Oblivion has the ability to haunt you visually and, with an unanticipated love story, even emotionally.","80","1483013"
"15667","Even when the pixels threaten to overwhelm, Gunn finds refuge in his main characters. There’s plenty to enjoy here.","80","3896198"
"15668","All Is True is sentimental, theatrical, likable – and unfashionable.","80","9206798"
"15669","Movie Marmite. Many will be perplexed. Donnie Darko fans should lap it up.","80","362478"
"15670","Roberts and Richard Gere costar in this bubbly scamper, which goes to the head like champagne -- the cheap, sweet kind that leaves you with a throbbing head. And yet this monstrously derivative romance is great giddy fun.","80","100405"
"15671","A literate, dialogue-driven treat delivered by a cast that truly savors the script's wicked wit.","80","180073"
"15672","You're going out with a touch of class: a slam-bang finale in 3-D -- make that Freddyvision; a gaggle of one-liners directed at the final crop of victims and a few in-jokes; some wonderfully bizarre dream sequences; and the possibility that while Freddy may be gone, some of his progeny may live on (we can say no more).","80","101917"
"15673","That Terry Gilliam managed to make Twelve Monkeys into a clever, complex, and poignant success is as astonishing as it is satisfying.","80","114746"
"15674","This may be Bullock's best performance. Ever.","80","878804"
"15675","Blunt’s performance has an edge of steel. She brings off a mix of confidence, bewilderment and vulnerability, which functions very well against the alpha male characters higher up the chain of command.","80","3397884"
"15676","Willfully empty but wildly entertaining, The Equalizer stands out from its peers like a wolf among lapdogs, as Fuqua and Washington bring out the best in each other for the benefit of the audience.","80","455944"
"15677","It might be a given that Pixar’s movies are visually spectacular, but The Good Dinosaur may be the studio’s most purely cinematic, the richness of the design and the emotional power of the widescreen compositions stirring deep, almost primal feelings about childhood, the loss of innocence and the untamed ferocity of the natural world.","80","1979388"
"15678","Dreyfuss' exemplary performance shows how selfishly Holland neglects his own family in favour of his pupils, and it's clear how conservative politics impinge even on music classes. A middle-brow melodrama which functions as the thinking person's Forrest Gump. Music to my ears.","80","113862"
"15679","As Oscar, Jordan at moments gives off vibes of a very young Denzel Washington in the way he combines gentleness and toughness; he effortlessly draws the viewer in toward him.","80","2334649"
"15680","A pleasurable throwback to the sort of gritty, low-tech international thriller that was a staple of the 1960s.","80","122690"
"15681","The Way Back is a somber sports drama more interested in exploring the plight of its hero than in just the big games.","80","8544498"
"15682","Like a good episode of ""Smallville"": You may feel a bit silly watching it if you're past high-school age, but you just might have a good time.","80","1464540"
"15683","J.C. Chandor's precocious writing-directing debut is fastidious, smart and more than a bit portentous as it probes the human costs of unchecked greed.","80","1615147"
"15684","Ivan Reitman directed, with great verve and unflagging finesse, from a terrifically funny script by Elizabeth Meriwether.","80","1411238"
"15685","The Coens' concern isn't emotional intensity but bravura camera moves and chic lighting of cinematographer Barry Sonnenfeld.","80","86979"
"15686","I laughed. And I laughed primarily over Heder's hilarious performance. You ain't seen nothing till you've seen Napoleon attack that tether ball.","80","374900"
"15687","It is an intricate and often brilliant drama, with restrained and intelligent performances; there is an elegantly patterned mosaic of detail, unexpected plot turns, suspenseful twists and revelations.","80","2404461"
"15688","Morose, shockingly violent yet strangely beautiful, Deliverance is a tale of what happens to civilized values when put to the test in a hostile wilderness environment.","80","68473"
"15689","It elicits so many laughs, in fact, that you have to wonder just what Judge did to piss off the suits at Fox so much that they would willingly torpedo one of the only genuinely hilarious movies to come out this year.","80","387808"
"15690","Not as groundbreaking as the original, nor as expansive as all the best sequels are. But with some excellent cast additions, and Miller on murky form, this still sizzles to the touch.","80","458481"
"15691","Director Jon Favreau's The Lion King is a worthwhile reimagining that relies on nostalgia over risk-taking.","80","6105098"
"15692","As with Platoon, Stone captures the horrific essence of an environment and transfers it to us without the need for prior knowledge. Dazzling filmmaking.","80","94291"

"15694","Doesn't go down smooth, but it doesn't promise to.","80","113627"
"15695","Though Law and Kidman spend much of the movie apart, Minghella and ace editor Walter Murch arrange their interweaving subplots like a running dialogue between two lovers, each compelled to survive on the thin hope that they'll be reunited.","80","159365"

"15697","The Coens have given us a hilarious, beautifully made, very enjoyable and rather disturbing anthology of stories from the old west, once planned for television but satisfyingly repurposed for the cinema: vignettes that switch with stunning force from picturesque sentimentality to grisly violence.","80","6412452"
"15698","Energetically lurid, gratuitously violent and a hell of a lot of fun, horror-satire Assassination Nation is a throwback to black-comedy teen flicks of yore, but with a bitingly timely feel.","80","6205872"
"15699","If it had lived up to its golden first five minutes, Up would have been the film of the decade. As it is, it remains the best animated flick of 2009, a funny, moving, beautifully made argument that dreamers can move mountains.","80","1049413"
"15700","Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are enormously funny in this farce.","80","396269"
"15701","MOST Americans are probably having a hard enough time trying to distinguish the good guys from the bad guys in Central America, and Oliver Stone's ""Salvador"" is careful not to help us take sides. Much to its credit, that's mainly what makes this political thriller so terrifying...It's not that there aren't any villains in this film -- based on the real-life account of photo-journalist Richard Boyle who co-wrote the screenplay with Stone -- but that there are so few good guys to turn to. [4 Apr 1986, p.29]","80","91886"
"15702","Sidney Lumet's direction, like David Mamet's patchy script (which adapts a Barry Reed novel), may not be quite good enough to justify the Rembrandt-like cinematography of Edward Pisoni and the brooding mood of self-importance, but it's good direction nonetheless; and there are plenty of supporting performances—by James Mason, Jack Warden, Milo O'Shea, Charlotte Rampling, and Lindsay Crouse, among others—to keep one distracted from Newman's dogged Oscar-pandering.","80","84855"

"15704","Two things make Eastwood's task easier for him: a superb cast and a cracking source novel. Dennis Lehane's book is one of the very best thrillers of recent years, richer in Boston detail and closer in character study than anything Eastwood manages to bring to the screen.","80","327056"

"15713","It is an intriguing confection of a movie, announcing its influences candidly, but exerting its originality too.","80","1800241"
"15714","Bringing Up Baby is constructed for maximum of laughs, with Ruggles and Catlett adding to the starring team’s zany antics. There is little rhyme or reason to most of the action, but it’s all highly palatable.","80","29947"
"15715","Particularly impressive is veteran cinematographer Dean Semler's inventive cinematography that manages to put the audience right in the middle of the races like never before.","80","1028576"

"15718","Arrival is a big, risky, showy movie which jumps up on its high-concept highwire and disdains a net. And yes, there are moments of silliness when it wobbles a little, but it provides you with spectacle and fervent romance.","80","2543164"
"15719","The trilogy ascends and soars with the two combatants and ends not with a whimper but with a blast of light. Thus the fabulous original film has found an honorable way to sign off. For those who didn't bother to join the early crowds, The Matrix Revolutions is a definite might see.","80","242653"
"15720","Even when the story mechanics feel more than a bit secondhand, the exquisite interplay of vibrant pastel hues and almost photorealist textures (smoothly but not crucially enhanced in 3D) makes the film a continual pleasure to behold.","80","1453405"
"15721","Ocean’s 8 is in many ways a mirror image of its predecessor, but it’s most delightful when it follows its own path toward girly transcendence.","80","5164214"
"15722","[McConaughey] delivers a twitchy, hostile performance on par with anything he's done since he escaped the rom com cul-de-sac.","80","790636"
"15723","Barney's Version is one of those rare films whose caricature of life undeniably illuminates. It's the vivid story of the topsy-turvy character so flawed you love him despite yourself.","80","1423894"
"15724","Though the story occasionally stretches credibility, the warmth and wit so reminiscent of the original Bridget Jones's Diary propels you along, being due in large part to the return of one woman: director Sharon Maguire. You feel her filthy, funny thumbprints pressed on almost every scene.","80","1473832"
"15725","Star Trek VI surprises us only by completely satisfying our expectations, by giving us exactly what we want from a ""Star Trek"" picture. It's not startling or revelatory, only witty, ebulliently good-natured and close to ideal.","80","102975"
"15726","A grisly extravaganza with an acute moral intelligence. The graphic special effects (which sometimes suggest a shotgun Jackson Pollock) are less upsetting than Romero's way of drawing the audience into the violence.","80","77402"
"15727","Top-flight muscleman entertainment that is not afraid to have a brain or two in its head.","80","100802"
"15728","An indie with real pedigree and smarts, Holofcener's comedy of manners is well-observered and well worth watching.","80","878835"
"15729","Like the bitter cold in which it's set, Affliction bites hard and true.","80","118564"
"15730","Whatever the virtues of The Queen--and it certainly has them--it simply would not exist without Mirren.","80","436697"
"15731","It might be a tad light when matched against the wittiest mysteries, but for all intents and purposes, The Girl On The Train is a tightly-wound Hitchcockian ride wrought with tension. Elements of voyeurism, self-loathing and murderous intent mix together in a volatile cocktail stirred gently by director Tate Taylor, who doesn’t dilute a single ingredient.","80","3631112"
"15732","The movie is not only a better version of the book, it's a work unto itself.","80","119314"
"15733","Turns out to be a thoroughly entertaining if eccentric piece of business, wacky and amusing in a cheerfully preposterous way. [28 September 1994, Calendar, p.F-1]","80","109707"
"15734","The keenly focused intelligence and low-boil intensity that James Vanderbilt demonstrated in his screenplay for “Zodiac” are on impressive display in Truth.","80","3859076"
"15735","I'd like to hear from some women about the sole scene I didn't buy--Bello getting angry, then super-turned-on when she learns about her calm Tom's tough-guy origins--but otherwise, A History of Violence is a remarkably convincing examination of heroism, hero worship, and the seductive allure of villainy.","80","399146"
"15736","One of the things that makes Signs such a refreshing summer movie is that it goes against almost all the grains of contemporary Hollywood razzle-dazzle filmmaking -- as did “The Sixth Sense.”","80","286106"
"15737","Unlike Burton, Schumacher doesn't let his stylistic and thematic fascinations run away with him; he keeps one hand on the wheel at all times. The result isn't as emotionally daring and visually outrageous as Burton at his best, but it's better paced and more consistently entertaining from one sequence to the next.","80","112462"
"15738","There’s slapstick and silliness to entertain small children and nefarious plots for the adult audience to untangle, making this a far more handsome prospect than any of its characters could imagine.","80","787474"
"15739","What he (Scott) does superbly is establish a raw, compelling reality that transcends his movie's banal premises and predictable conclusion. That permits Moore to play, and us to feel, authentic pain, isola- tion and courage--shocking stuff to find in an action movie these days. [25 August 1997, p. 72]","80","119173"
"15740","Zandvliet’s script and direction avoid milking an innately loaded situation for excess melodrama or pathos, sticking to a discreet economy of approach that accumulates considerable power.","80","3841424"
"15741","If you're game, ""Parnassus"" is a richly rewarding experience. If not, it comes off like pretentious nonsense.","80","1054606"
"15742","Writer-director Allan Moyle's story about a shy high school student who galvanizes an Arizona suburb with a rebellious pirate radio show has rambunctious energy and defiant attitude.","80","100436"
"15743","A magisterial film, but not quite a great one.","80","89881"
"15744","It is less a true-life thriller than a kind of justice procedural – and a sharp, scouring work of moral seriousness from Greengrass.","80","7280898"
"15745","Ghastly yet wonderful at the same time.","80","187738"
"15746","Emotionally On Golden Pond is no less valid for being something of a cliche. Anyway, the characters are so strong that the piece does not play as a cliché. Hepburn, for example may have a less chewy part than has Fonda, but the briskness of her manner, her well-justified image as a no-nonsense individualist who is nevertheless a good sport, serve her wonderfully. There is a vivifying touch of tension between an actress who was a liberated woman before the movement was born and her role as traditional wife and mother.","80","82846"
"15747","At once exhausting and astonishing, this no-holds-barred adaptation of British junkie-turned-pugilist Billy Moore’s Thai prison memoir is a big, bleeding feat of extreme cinema, given elevating human dimension by rising star Joe Cole’s ferociously physical lead performance.","80","4080956"
"15748","A funny, heartfelt look at families, relationships and the lies that prop them up as much as tear them down.","80","1174730"
"15749","It is eccentric, sad and stirring to the core. Oh yes – and incredibly funny, too.","80","3385524"
"15750","Bryan Cranston creates a potent sense of Trumbo as a reasonable man, full of charm, eloquence and principle and he is surrounded by a string of performances to savour.","80","3203606"
"15751","Even those familiar with King’s 2013 follow-up of the same name, more of an absorbing dark fantasy than a horror novel, won’t be prepared for the alchemy of elements cooked up here.","80","5606664"
"15752","Though somewhat overplayed and coy about its destination, the film packs a helluva wallop.","80","107302"
"15753","A raffishly ironic and insinuating movie--and probably the most sheerly enjoyable film of the year so far.","80","399295"
"15754","So ingeniously constructed that these meta-noir ingredients feel dizzyingly enjoyable, never hackneyed. In fact, the overheated melodrama of Identity is crucial to its method -- and the key, in some ways, to its narrative secrets.","80","309698"
"15755","Bob rests entirely on Murray's shoulders. But he more than takes the weight.","80","103241"
"15756","This is a captivating experience.","80","109830"
"15757","A cracking conspiracy thriller that's well-cast, slyly satirical and -- as a solid, glossy, contemporised remix of a classic -- rings enough creepy changes to surprise.","80","368008"
"15758","It’s a smart gen-gap tale with loveable characters.","80","4501244"
"15759","It's like a chick flick for men--and the women who love them, sniff-sniff.","80","186151"
"15760","Like a swoony lost chapter from ""Paris, je t'aime"" agreeably extended to feature length.","80","1605783"
"15761","The joy comes not from the will-they-won't-they romance between the two leads, but from the sharply written humour from the pen of writer Nora Ephron.","80","98635"
"15762","Denzel Washington is aces as a commercial airline pilot who pulls off a miraculous mid-air stunt while flying with a 0.24 blood alcohol concentration, only to face his demons on the ground.","80","1907668"
"15763","Whereas the jokes in the “Grown Ups” series feel reactionary and bullying, the family-friendly Hotel Transylvania gags (in the script by Sandler and Robert Smigel) instead come off as clever and humane, even when they’re making fun of helicopter moms and lawsuit-sensitive summer camps.","80","2510894"
"15764","There's no doubt that Kill Bill is an epic, and no doubt of the skill that's often apparent. But what it leaves us with is awesomely trivial.","80","378194"
"15765","An awesomely, stiflingly professional piece of work, with a fleet, superficial visual style, perfectly placed climaxes, and a screenplay (by Douglas Day Stewart) that doesn't waste a single character or situation - everything is functional, and nothing but functional.","80","84434"
"15766","Probably the most consistently entertaining of the Bond packages up to the time - not as startling as parts of ""Goldfinger"" but much superior to ""Thunderball.""","80","62512"
"15767","Michelle Pfeiffer and Treat Williams give such magnetic performances that they elevate the film way above its middlebrow sensibility and proclivity for neat resolutions.","80","120646"
"15768","Thornton has written himself the role of a lifetime, yet he plays Karl with neither condescension nor saintliness.","80","117666"
"15769","Before Midnight counts on our previous investment to keep us riveted. We are. And we want them back in spirit on that train to Vienna as much as they do. What’s next — After Sunrise?","80","2209418"
"15770","Enough wild-card energy to keep it bright and surprising.","80","119229"
"15771","This is a crazy, dishevelled, often hilarious film, in which lightning flashes of wit and insight crackle periodically across a plane of tedium.","80","69049"
"15772","Mistress America eventually travels down roads of broken trust and acceptance of reality, but please don’t let those heavy themes suggest this movie is anything other than pure delight. The primacy of the joke rules the day.","80","2872462"
"15773","Hal Ashby directs Being There at an unruffled, elegant pace, the better to let Mr. Sellers's double-edged mannerisms make their full impression upon the audience.","80","78841"
"15774","Takes its absurd premise and keeps itself narrowly focused, pushing its heroic cast through obstacle after obstacle.","80","118571"
"15775","The movie is a piece of junk...However, it's also immensely likable and hysterically, irreverently funny.","80","113749"
"15776","Campion has created another resonant paean to love’s pain and joy, and gives new life to John Keats, too often now associated with dusty school books.","80","810784"
"15777","Although it may initially seem like a fairly wispy story of family dynamics and romantic uncertainty, there’s a subtle depth to the proceedings that creeps up on you in resonant ways.","80","8019694"
"15778","Beautifully executed, loaded with sharp observational moments, and never cheats either its characters or its audience by descending into raunchy teen-movie cliché. This is a delicately balanced and often very funny holiday alternative suitable for pretty much the entire family.","80","1727388"
"15779","Above all, the movie's funny and wicked fun.","80","371246"
"15780","Sometimes, a movie just has a magic about it, something that makes you look past implausibility and plot holes and whatever other shortcomings it may have and leaves you feeling good just for having seen it.","80","2179116"
"15781","A crime-flick love story as Pop-conscious as Wright's earlier work but unironic about its romantic core, it will delight the director's fans but requires no film-geek certification.","80","3890160"
"15782","Strikingly shot, edited and scored, with convincing and vivid performances from a youthful cast, the picture loses its footing in the final stretch but should still take high rank among U.S. debuts of its ilk this year","80","5112578"
"15783","Action-packed, gorgeous, and faithfully whimsical: Hergé thought Spielberg the only director capable of filming Tintin. He was onto something.","80","983193"
"15784","A spectacularly gung-ho sci-fi epic that delivers two hours of good, nasty fun.","80","120201"
"15785","Ferrara hasn't merely remade Body Snatchers; he has reimagined and reinvigorated it, using the best of special-effects talent and cool directorial skill to turn out a splendidly creepy and unsettling piece of genre filmmaking that knows how to scare you and isn't afraid to try. [04 Feb 1994, p.F1]","80","106452"
"15786","The much-publicized decision to go ""younger and sexier"" with the casting--a move that turns out to pay off handsomely, enhancing and enriching the material.","80","293508"
"15787","That sense of one small, private world shattering within the larger and even more unstable one around it is the essence of Michael Winterbottom's unmooring, bleakly beautiful film version of A Mighty Heart.","80","829459"
"15788","Designed and destined to win no awards, Machete is expert, cartoon-violent, lighthearted fun. Just the thing to send Junior back to school in a good mood.","80","985694"
"15789","The script may have rubbery legs, but the action is rock-hard. The surprise is the lightness of touch: treat as a comedy for best results.","80","418279"
"15790","300 is a feast for the senses (well, two of them anyway) and an impressive technical achievement. More than that, it's a hell of a lot of fun.","80","416449"
"15791","A genuine work of the popular imagination. It's the first true populist science-fiction film, a blend of the most startling, far-out special effects with the most ordinary human material of the American Heartland. [21 Nov 1977, p.88]","80","75860"
"15792","It's a handsome and skillful retelling of a legend that imaginatively draws on conventions of both the western and the gangster movie to create an energetic yet thoughtful contemporary action-adventure.","80","244000"
"15793","It may be too slow for some tastes, but Babel remains emotionally bruising but compulsive viewing.","80","449467"
"15794","A fun, breezy roadtrip across the Western landscape.","80","103074"
"15795","Clearly the work of an ambitious writer/director who can see himself inheriting the mantle of Rod Serling ... it offers twists and ironies and false endings galore — along with more laughs than the comedian-turned-auteur dared to include in his debut film. ... It packs a punch.","80","6857112"
"15796","A sharp-edged, sweet-centred, warm-hearted coming-of-age movie that’s always just that little bit smarter than you think it is.","80","467406"
"15797","The movie is expert piffle for grownups, directed with great energy by John McTiernan and written with verve by Leslie Dixon and Kurt Wimmer.","80","155267"
"15798","For the eternal adolescents of the '80s, ""Warrior"" is even more primal fun than its predecessor. Miller has perfected the popup Spielberg style and laced it with speed. [31 May 1982, p.67]","80","82694"
"15799","Bogdanovichs perfect recreation of the sense of time and place, and his ability to mix wit with poignancy that make this such a charming, timeless film.","80","67328"
"15800","In all, this is a movie that is partial to youth as a state of being. The grownups seem finished, as frozen in their lifetime roles as creatures out of myth or the Bible. But Oliver and Jordana have the freedom to go anywhere, do anything, become anything. Submarine is an exhilarating surprise.","80","1440292"
"15801","Perhaps it is slightly labored. Perhaps it does have the air of an initially brilliant inspiration that has not worked out as easily as it seemed it should. Still and all, Mr. Rose's nimble writing and Alexander Mackendrick's directing skill have managed to assure The Ladykillers of a distinct and fetching comic quality.","80","48281"
"15802","Expanding enormously on the fantasy elements of his earlier films, Carpenter has turned in a full-scale thriller of the supernatural, as a sinister fog bank comes rolling in off the sea to take revenge on the smug little town of Antonio Bay.","80","80749"
"15803","Revenge is sweet and Ritter gets his due in any number of silly and embarrassing situations which he handles with nearly perfect comic timing.","80","98343"
"15804","What's missing, then? There's no fiery central performance in the mix (the horse doesn't count), and once Emily Watson's hardscrabble mom is rotated out of the action, you yearn for an anchor.","80","1568911"
"15805","I loved Downhill for precisely what it meant to be—a character-driven comedy working its way through a painful and real conflict.","80","4558376"
"15806","Starting from a single key insight into human behavior — the natural compulsion to compare oneself to others — White has spun a funny, empathetic and surprisingly grounded comedy that itself defies obvious comparisons.","80","5884230"
"15807","Pretty much rocks.","80","360486"
"15808","Jaunty and entertaining.","80","1486190"
"15809","It’s a film with love at its root, both familial and romantic, and Jenkins fills so much of it with a radiating warmth.","80","7125860"
"15810","Far and away the best of the Star Wars prequels (tough chore, that) and also holds its own with the hallowed films of the original trilogy.","80","121766"
"15811","It might be Charlie Kaufman lite, but this is a great date movie for the discerning -- smart, ingenious and heartwarming.","80","420223"
"15812","The cast is uniformly outstanding, a pleasure to watch. It's a more toned-down role for the often-fiery McAvoy, and it suits him.","80","968264"
"15813","It’s Hauser who carries the film in a rare and unlikely role, that of a presumed loser in life (the man did die just a few years later, at 44) who suffered very unwanted attention — but who, when he needed to, found a way to rise to the occasion.","80","3513548"
"15814","As classy a film as could be made from Stieg Larsson's sordid page-turner, David Fincher's much-anticipated return to serial-killer territory is a fastidiously grim pulp entertainment that plays like a first-class train ride through progressively bleaker circles of hell.","80","1568346"
"15815","Even in the film’s less successful moments, I admired the loose shagginess of it all.","80","6000478"
"15816","As hilarious as it is touching and tasteful at the same time, Tootsie will offend no one and uplift anyone who watches it.","80","84805"
"15817","In the end, the most interesting aspect of this quiet, sometimes frustrating, sometimes thrilling film is the way it teases out the intricate power structures that flourish even in as godforsaken (and lovely) a place as the Ozarks.","80","1399683"
"15818","Top it off with a cameo by the real-life Phil Kaufman, and you've got a rock'n'roll road movie like no other. Wherever he is, Gram should get a kick out of it.","80","338075"
"15819","A near-irresistible Friday-night-out monster picture in the tradition of Lake Placid or Tremors, with a boozy Irish charm that makes it a distinctive addition to the catalogue of alien invasions.","80","1525366"
"15820","One of this film's greatest accomplishments is its making an audience believe that the Corleones and their various partners in crime have been entirely in character during the intervening decades, but have simply neglected to turn up on screen.","80","99674"
"15821","A somber, absorbing thriller that treads familiar psycho serial killer terrain with style. Elegantly made and comparatively restrained in cramming sick and grisly stuff down the audience's throat.","80","364045"
"15822","A fun, heart-warming adventure.","80","57115"
"15823","Ledger is a charismatic, conflicted hero who internalizes his character's shame and anguish to powerful effect. Wes Bentley is similarly strong as Ledger's best friend turned romantic rival, and Kapur makes the most of Africa's breathtaking desert, crafting a gorgeous spectacle that's at once stately and hyper-real.","80","240510"
"15824","There is no denying that the environmental message is heavy-handed.","80","1482459"
"15825","Made may look like a Wong Kar-Wai movie -- the cinematographer, Chris Doyle, has brought to the film the dark, rich romanticism of the movies he's shot for the Hong Kong prodigy -- but the sensibility is Woody Allen, only sweeter.","80","227005"
"15826","Think of The Nice Guys as candy noir: all the key ingredients from mysteries such as Chinatown and The Long Goodbye poured into a tall glass, then topped up with sugar syrup, a spritz of club soda, a sprig of mint and an ironic paper parasol.","80","3799694"
"15827","It's both funny and enlightening, a nuanced yet strikingly bold look at how teens see themselves, not how adults would like to see them. Parents: Take note. Teens: Relax, you'll figure it out.","80","4729990"
"15828","A severe and eerily beautiful German-language drama.","80","1149362"
"15829","A beautifully off-center movie.","80","128445"
"15830","Dryly clever.","80","119654"
"15831","Immensely likable.","80","147800"
"15832","Grand fantasy, in which Brendan Fraser and stylish design and energetic special effects play off one another for maximum fun.","80","166276"
"15833","A political thriller with more plausibility -- and yes, more thrills -- than most.","80","133952"
"15834","Whatever its ultimate position on the greatest hits list, Monsters, Inc. is supple and technologically sophisticated entertainment.","80","198781"
"15835","Played by Ron Perlman, he's the most magnetic action hero I've come across in a long while.","80","167190"
"15836","This campy extravaganza has it all - heroes, villains, beautiful women and high stakes. Laughably bad and fantastically good all at once, this is a guilty pleasure that everyone can enjoy.","80","80745"
"15837","Who says remakes are always inferior to the original film? And who says the western is dead? Especially when a movie is as entertaining as this one, you begin to think this formerly beloved genre is due for a revival.","80","381849"
"15838","The strongest magnet in this psychedelic morass is Johnny Depp who, as the story's antic, disgusting and seductive spirit guide, is impossible to look away from.","80","120669"
"15839","The film rips right along and never relinquishes its grip.","80","1535109"
"15840","You could also say the picture lacks a coherent plot and complex characterization, but those are irrelevant to the genre. The movie is like a superior athlete who gets tongue-tied in a post-game interview but on the field is poetry in motion.","80","429493"
"15841","Krasinki's soft-sell script, lets the movie's ideas get absorbed without grandstanding or pretension. Its issues go down with a smile and common sense, which turns out to be exactly the right formula.","80","2091473"
"15842","Guaranteed to offend a lot of folks across the political and belief spectrum, but consistently funny and horribly to the point. A sit-com spin-off is probably not on the cards, though.","80","1341167"
"15843","A film for anyone who’s ever climbed trees, grazed knees or basked in the comfort of a parent’s sympathy as they’ve pulled you off the ground crying. It’ll make your inner child run wild.","80","386117"
"15844","From a filmmaking point of view, this is a work that the old Hollywood moguls themselves would have been proud to present.","80","397535"
"15845","So long as Casino stays focused on the excesses -- of language, of violence, of ambition -- in the life-styles of the rich and infamous, it remains a smart, knowing, if often repetitive, spectacle.","80","112641"
"15846","Two decades after dinosaurs ruled the Earth’s cinemas, are we still capable of putting our phones away for two hours and being honestly amazed by them, without a glaze of cynicism or irony to keep us stuck? Trevorrow, his cast and crew would clearly like to think so. And in light of their efforts, you’d have to grinningly agree.","80","369610"
"15847","Producer Gene Roddenberry and director Robert Wise have corralled an enormous technical crew, and the result is state-of-the-art screen magic.","80","79945"
"15848","At its best Ferris Bueller is a free-spirited romp, a devil-may-care respite from grueling dailiness.","80","91042"
"15849","Unforgiven... never quite fulfills the expectations it so carefully sets up. It doesn't exactly deny them, but the bloody confrontations that end the film appear to be purposely muted, more effective theoretically than dramatically.","80","105695"
"15850","The pace never slows, the jokes never miss and the stunts never disappoint in this macho-dream of an actioner.","80","93409"
"15851","The Firm and The Pelican Brief, both of last year, were solid entertainment. Now along comes the movie version of The Client - the best of the Grisham film trilogy.","80","109446"
"15852","Turning the pious cliches of World War II melodrama on their heads, Boorman has made his most dizzyingly funny movie, an anarchic celebration of family. The warmth that exudes from these turbulent recollections isn't a sentimental heat but a joyful one: Boorman's eyes see the foibles and betrayals of adult life, the casual savagery of children, and forgive all. It's an idyll set amidst urban rubble. [19 Oct 1987, p.84]","80","93209"
"15853","The setup isn't exactly what you'd call plausible, but the follow-through is consistent and clever.","80","94737"
"15854","The Descendants is gentle, witty, audience-friendly entertainment for grown-ups, with a great performance by one of our biggest screen stars.","80","1033575"
"15855","Extremely enjoyable. Although it’s a little tonally unsure, whenever Hanks and Hoffman are on screen, any misgivings are forgiven.","80","472062"
"15856","Heathers gave me the creeps but it also made me laugh. This bizarre variation on that Hollywood staple, the teen movie, is one weird original. [30 Mar 1989 p.A12(E)]","80","97493"
"15857","There's little doubt that Kazan has written a sly, amusing portrait of male self-absorption and artistic tyranny.","80","1839492"
"15858","The incredible special effects, which make lush cherry blossoms as vivid as the intense battle scenes, are balanced by Disney's tradition of care and painstaking detail in developing and animating its characters.","80","120762"
"15859","Nicole Kidman -- continuing the string of remarkable performances that have followed ""Eyes Wide Shut"" -- finds plenty of fodder in the long-delayed Birthday Girl. A grimy thriller with a wicked streak of humor.","80","188453"
"15860","This accomplished debut feature avoids most of the usual pitfalls, channeling its outrage into a tense, focused piece of storytelling with a powerful sense of empathy.","80","896872"
"15861","A fast and furious feature film that starts at a gallop and never stops to catch its breath. [9 Aug 1993, p.57]","80","106977"
"15862","With composure so out of fashion these days in the public square, Steven Soderbergh's adamantly restrained The Informant! arrives like a cleansing tonic.","80","1130080"
"15863","Only Tarantino could come up with such a wild cross-cultural mash, a smorgasbord of ingredients stemming from spaghetti Westerns, German legend, historical slavery, modern rap music, proto-Ku Klux Klan fashion, an assembly of '60s and '70s character actors and a leading couple meant to be the distant forebears of blaxploitation hero John Shaft and make it not only digestible but actually pretty delicious.","80","1853728"
"15864","From the visceral plunges of the first person mind clip sequences (including a terrifying, controversy courting rape sequence) to the overwhelming finale this is a, literally, stunning event. Some directors can, thank God, still make you experience films.","80","114558"
"15865","Romantic and preposterous all at once, it's actually a funny, endearing fable about courage, love and faith...So endearing that the flatness about its last few minutes manages not to sink the picture. [9 March 1990, p.C1]","80","99892"
"15866","It's hard to do justice to Hawkins's acting, because you never actually see it: Her Rita simply is.","80","1371155"
"15867","Structurally, Predator is a classic behind-enemy-lines/buddy movies. Nothing much new, just well done.","80","93773"
"15868","Breezy and easy to swallow. Its maker, Steven Spielberg, hasn't had so much fun in two decades.","80","264464"
"15869","The first hour of this lean, mean, 95-minute scream machine is so tasty that it redeems the predictable conclusion.","80","463854"
"15870","Demanding, even confusing at times, this is required viewing that requires your full attention.","80","365737"
"15871","Leigh has been giving actors their tongues for decades, and of all his films, Happy-Go-Lucky is the easiest, the least labored.","80","1045670"
"15872","This isn't just a thrill ride; it's a rocket into the thrilling past, when directors could scare you with how much emotion they packed into a movie.","80","119094"
"15873","At once entirely frank and downright cuddly in the way it deals with the seldom-visited subject of the sex lives of people with disabilities, this well-acted and constructed film will, at the very least, turn the spotlight on this unusual topic.","80","1866249"
"15874","Van Sant casts a gently hypnotic spell that is not easily forgotten.","80","102494"
"15875","Restores our belief in the power of movies to transform reality, even temporarily. So what if it's not perfect? It's magic.","80","101889"
"15876","What matters is that the movie's a blast, right up until its protracted climax.","80","209163"
"15877","Ultimately, Den of Thieves falls short of its goal, but it gets points for aiming high; there are worse things than trying to be the next Michael Mann when few others would dare try, especially if they lack the enthusiasm oozing out of every frame of your imitation.","80","1259528"
"15878","Skyscraper is a tribute to duct tape, and to Dwayne Johnson’s enduring appeal. The movie is great, outlandish fun because the star makes it so; he’s a soft soul in an action-hard body.","80","5758778"
"15879","Though there isn’t a single word of dialogue in the film’s 80-minute running time, the big questions it asks, about ambition, acceptance and the beauty of companionship, ring loud in every heart-melting frame.","80","3666024"
"15880","The prequels this ain’t. We can all breathe again.","80","2488496"
"15881","A modestly scaled and highly pleasurable sequel to Wan’s low-budget 2011 smash that should have genre fans begging for thirds.","80","2226417"
"15882","Well written, well made, well acted, St. Elmo's Fire is a quintessential film about the strange middleground between youth and adulthood.","80","90060"
"15883","Engrossing western which inspired a huge genre revivial.","80","90022"
"15884","It's also quite energetic -- there isn't a boring shot anywhere, and writer-director Schnabel is clearly enjoying himself as he plays with expressionist sound, neo-Eisensteinian edits, and all sorts of other filmic ideas.","80","115632"
"15885","Solid family fare with plenty of yocks...For the most part, helmer Jeremiah Chechik makes an adept debut, injecting plenty of energy and spirit.","80","97958"
"15886","On balance, this is a meaty, strongly realized dramatic work of considerable accomplishment.","80","1120985"
"15887","A crusty jewel of a performance by Brendan Gleeson goes a long way toward enlivening an otherwise routine tale of murder, blackmail, drug trafficking and rural police corruption in The Guard.","80","1540133"
"15888","This is a film which breathes life, as well as alcohol fumes, into history. Like its central character, Darkest Hour has “mobilised the English language and sent it into battle.”","80","4555426"
"15889","Between this cast and the conviction Jarecki brings to the table, the film feels incredibly accomplished for a first feature.","80","1764183"
"15890","The characters are much less finely tuned and the climax is a botch, but the French-financed film is often a riot, and the sensibility is all there.","80","219822"
"15891","What matters is the stunts and the spirit, and this latest set of exotic exploits of an indomitable hero (Kurt Russell) and a spunky heroine (Kim Cattrall) gives good value.","80","90728"
"15892","In the Apatow manner, Segel mines a mother lode of painful personal memories for his breakup gags, and the vanity of entertainment people proves to be another rich vein.","80","800039"
"15893","Relentlessly funny satire.","80","120202"
"15894","Breathe is a valentine, but it's a valentine that is quite moving.","80","5716464"
"15895","The powerhouse of the film is Tim Curry's cross-dressing alien, Frank N. Furter, who would never reach these kinds of gloriously demented heights again.","80","73629"
"15896","Easily one of the funniest comedies of the year and one you wouldn’t mind seeing again and again.","80","829482"
"15897","Paramount's most lucrative long-running franchise (nine films in nineteen years) shows little wear and tear in this installment, perhaps the most colorful and relaxed of the series.","80","120844"
"15898","Like its hero, Ender’s Game relies on brains more than brute force. An absorbing portrait of Lord Of The Flies-style morality housed in imaginative sci-fi casing.","80","1731141"
"15899","A movie with an unflinchingly tough heart.","80","1532503"
"15900","This surprising collaboration between director Clint Eastwood and ""Milk"" screenwriter Dustin Lance Black tackles its trickiest challenges with plausibility and good sense, while serving up a simmeringly caustic view of its controversial subject's behavior, public and private.","80","1616195"
"15901","All ye searching for Primal Fear redux, abandon hope. The character-driven drama he (Curran) offers viewers instead is something far more complex, cracked and unique for an American movie boasting big-name stars: an unblinking glare into the abyss.","80","1423995"
"15902","Despite mostly unprofessional acting, near nonexistent production values, homemade special effects, and cheap grainy black-and-white film stock, the film is a triumph.","80","63350"
"15903","Visually Megamind is immaculately sleek and gracefully enhanced by 3-D. The score by Hans Zimmer and Lorne Balfe is refreshingly subtle for an action comedy.","80","1001526"
"15904","Directed by, and starring, Don Cheadle, it's more about truth than facts. Did this all happen just the way it's laid out? Definitely not. But if the notes are wrong, the themes are right.","80","790770"
"15905","Narnia, brightly lit and kid-friendly, has an appealingly old-fashioned feel to it. Adamson, codirector of ""Shrek,"" wisely doesn't try to hip-ify the tale, leaving its curious blend of medieval pageantry, Christian fable and children's bedtime story intact.","80","363771"
"15906","Direction by Ken Russell has energy to spare, with appropriate match-up of his baroque visual style to special effects intensive material.","80","80360"
"15907","An entertaining tangle of pop aesthetic and comic book myth that occasionally bogs down, but manages to be ingratiating for all its defects.","80","119116"
"15908","An utterly bizarre, weirdly compelling story of manimal love that stakes out its own brazen path somewhere between “The Fly” and “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.”","80","3099498"
"15909","A big-bang demolition derby, J.J. Abrams's much-anticipated, greatly enjoyable Super 8 seems bound for box-office glory.","80","1650062"
"15910","Cameron isn't as concerned with scares or atmosphere, the staples of traditional horror films, as he is with setting up difficult situations for his characters to get out of, leaving audiences deliciously on edge.","80","90605"
"15911","With A+ voice talent provided by Meg Ryan (Anastasia) and John Cusack (Dimitri), Fox has a winner on its hands.","80","118617"
"15912","It’s Thompson as the heroically unbiddable Travers who makes the most of it; her bravura performance effectively dominates the film.","80","2140373"
"15913","Stunningly animated, cleverly scripted, and genuinely humorous.","80","382932"
"15914","Novitiate sure-handedly takes us inside the world of belief with care, concern and a piercing, discerning eye.","80","4513316"
"15915","As with Jordan Peele’s Get Out, or Coogler’s 2015 Rocky spin-off Creed, Black Panther isn’t a novelty, but a fresh perspective on a well-worn format. Not to get all Rosa Parks about it, but the film walks into the multiplex like it’s insane that it hasn’t been allowed in there all along. And it is.","80","1825683"
"15916","Anything that inspires that many whoops, gasps and groans with only two actors and a few choice words has earned its place at the summertime box office trough.","80","381681"
"15917","Cruise was born to play company man, and the role is an opportunity to sum up his old roles and transcend them with his most potently emotional work.","80","106918"
"15918","Painful, funny and beautifully acted, by Jeff Daniels particularly, who gives a career-best performance.","80","367089"
"15919","Not as divine as Ang Lee's ""Sense and Sensibility,"" but engagingly comparable to the Gwyneth Paltrow-starring Emma and vastly superior to Mansfield Park.","80","414387"
"15920","Succeeds best as a witty, knowing commentary on the genre itself. References to lycanthropic lore, literature and cinema abound; gags are plentiful; and the whole thing casts a pleasingly skeptical glance at various social fashions and fads of the times.","80","82533"
"15921","This fourth iteration of a series that first burst upon the world in 1988 turns out to be terrific entertainment, and startlingly shrewd in the bargain, a combination of minimalist performances -- interestingly minimalist -- and maximalist stunts that make you laugh, as you gape, at their thunderous extravagance.","80","337978"
"15922","If you are asking an audience to listen to one man talking for an hour and a half, you had better make sure he is worth listening to, and minute-by-minute, Hardy has you spellbound.","80","2692904"
"15923","Working Girl is enjoyable even when it isn't credible, which is most of the time. The film, like its heroine, has a genius for getting by on pure charm.","80","96463"
"15924","The barbs of wit, delivered throughout, are like the retractable daggers used in stage productions of ""Macbeth"" or ""Julius Caesar"": they gleam enticingly, they plunge home to the hilt, but they leave no trace of a wound.","80","1504320"
"15925","Though acid is dropped, groupies are bartered like poker chips and rock-star egos flare like fireworks, what comes through is the relative innocence of that era.","80","181875"
"15926","If you're a novice, this is a plucky introduction to Whedon's world and the most fun sci-fi of the year. If you're a devotee, this is the magnificent return you've been praying for.","80","379786"
"15927","Lanthimos has broadened his scope and has created a marvellously bleak, bizarre comedy.","80","3464902"
"15928","American History X is a crash course on how to make a message movie that resonates with crackling power.","80","120586"
"15929","With more than enough witty, well-observed details, it's a little charmer.","80","97322"
"15930","Gervais and Robinson take what might have been a cute concept comedy and elevate it to delicious heights.","80","1058017"
"15931","Lopez slinks through Hustlers with a deceptive ease, as in control of the film as her character is of her situation. It’s the sort of role that only a true movie star could pull off, so much of it reliant on a rare, intoxicating magnetism.","80","5503686"
"15932","Handsomely done and beautifully acted, just slightly wanting in a screenplay that leaves questions unanswered about what's behind these unhappy people. And it's ultra-depressing...","80","959337"
"15933","It's that smile playing on Rosemary's lips, suggesting that her maternal instinct and the conspirators' hold on this vapid baby doll have prevailed, that provides the biggest chill.","80","63522"
"15934","No matter what comes next from Marvel Studios, this Avengers is a gargantuan love letter to the equally enormous mythology that Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko and the rest of their collaborators built — and to the generations of readers and moviegoers who truly believe in it.","80","4154796"
"15935","Washington creates an indelibly charming and terrifying character whose volatile blend of dedication and horrible expediency keeps us off balance.","80","139654"
"15936","Anyone who has ever worked in an office will be able to identify with the antics in Nine to Five. Although it can probably be argued that Patricia Resnick and director Colin Higgins' script [from a story by Resnick] at times borders on the inane, the bottom line is that this picture is a lot of fun.","80","80319"
"15937","Dean Parisot's direction of the funny, affectionately satirical script by David Howard and Robert Gordon is crisp and assured.","80","177789"
"15938","The Bling Ring traces an intriguing feedback loop of which it is knowingly a part: a movie that affords its subjects the very immortality they so aggressively sought.","80","2132285"
"15939","Wall-E is an improbable delight, a G-rated crowd-pleaser.","80","910970"
"15940","If you're a martial arts/action movie fan in particular, much of the action in the film will leave you very satisfied. There's a prison escape sequence that is jaw-droppingly cool.","80","441773"
"15941","Highly entertaining, erotic science-fiction thriller that takes Mr. Crowe into Steven Spielberg territory.","80","259711"
"15942","At the top of his game, Carpenter and his cohorts boldly tap into the twin strains of paranoia gripping the present-day American society, suggesting that we face one or the other of two of our worst nightmares coming true. [09 Aug 1996, p.F1]","80","116225"
"15943","Delivers the goods, if the goods you're in the market for happen to be a clever romance concerning William Shakespeare that's unlikely to cause anyone to reassess their notions of Shakespeare, romance, or enjoyment.","80","138097"
"15944","Her film reaches the audience-friendly highs of a studio comedy while retaining an indie sensibility, both in its visuals and its tone, and coupled with the script’s rooted awareness of the moment we’re now in, it feels fresh, a film that will be rewatched and quoted, held on a pedestal by those who understand its necessity.","80","1489887"
"15945","Without its commitment to an idea of salvation, Pulp Fiction would be little more than a terrific parlor trick; with it, it's something far richer and more haunting.","80","110912"
"15946","A lot of very good actors...do honest, probing work in a context where, typically, less will do.","80","113277"
"15947","Bean has built a bonfire of contradictions and the ensuing conflagration illuminates a bit of the world.","80","247199"
"15948","The film sits somewhere between the bogus virtue of Kramer's The Defiant Ones and the poetry of Laughton's Night of the Hunter, combining racial intolerance with the nightmares of childhood, born out of Kennedy's stand on civil rights and Martin Luther King's marching.","80","56592"
"15949","Like a perfect cocktail mixes the sour with the sweet and the bright with the boozy, Focus combines seamless, superbly-crafted filmmaking with the fizz and fun created by its leads.","80","2381941"
"15950","Superb direction from Terence Fisher and a crisp, clean script by Jimmy Sangster are complemented by a rapturous score from James Bernard. [27 Oct 2013, p.6]","80","51554"
"15951","American Animals is not like other criminal stories and the differences make it one of the summer's freshest, most entertaining films.","80","6212478"
"15952","Douglas and Turner make a great double act in this exuberantly directed adventure movie with a great start turn from the always enjoyable De Vito. Good stuff.","80","88011"
"15953","Lady Bird doesn’t exist as a twee indie movie construct, it feels thrillingly real and deeply personal, every single beat ringing true.","80","4925292"
"15954","Francis Coppola's Apocalypse Now lives up to its grand title, disclosing not only the various faces of war but also the contradictions between excitement and boredom, terror and pity, brutality and beauty. Its epiphanies would do credit to Federico Fellini, who is indirectly quoted at one point.","80","78788"
"15955","A dramedy laying out the dueling coaching philosophies of guys who doubtless meant a great deal to fans, but of whom I'd been blissfully unaware for decades -- is enormously engaging. Enormously.","80","1226271"
"15956","Despite a notable but effective change in story emphasis, Jaws 2 is a worthy successor in horror, suspense and terror to its 1975 smash progenitor.","80","77766"
"15957","This is Capra at his best, very funny and very light, with a minimum of populist posturing.","80","25316"
"15958","If you're returning for more Donnie, you'll still have tears in your eyes come the sublime Mad World conclusion. If it's your first viewing, you should still be wowed by an astounding masterpiece. But this is undoubtedly the lesser of the two cuts, and since you have the choice, you should stick with version one.","80","246578"
"15959","Grant does have charm, wit and intelligence, displayed through subtlety of inflection, timing and an ability to convey unspoken thoughts between utterances. That's quite a good deal. [April 4, 1994]","80","109831"
"15960","There's a new bogeyman in town, and he makes all other pretenders to the terror throne look like a bunch of cuddly Disney characters.","80","103919"
"15961","The filmmakers’ handling of the surprises has a narrative deftness and visual cleverness that is legitimately unbalancing. It also adds a blast of dark comedy to the proceedings.","80","6169694"
"15962","What’s best about the film is how Cedar and Gere have dreamed up a character who’s equally desperate and preternaturally ingratiating.","80","4191702"
"15963","Though it’s a good movie in and of itself, The Little Mermaid is even more fascinating as a Rosetta Stone of Disney history, representing the classic animation techniques that the studio revived for this film, the cheap shortcuts that had prevailed for much of the previous two decades, and the sophisticated modern storytelling that soon became the standard.","80","97757"
"15964","As repellent a figure as many may still find Gibson, I have to report he’s absolutely hit Hacksaw Ridge out of the park.","80","2119532"
"15965","The film is a whirl of pure pleasure that just keeps whirling: Sondheim doesn’t write show-stoppers but show-surgers, and from the moment the glorious opening number whips up, introducing the central players, the film cartwheels onwards until it lands at its unexpected but quite beautiful happy-ever-after.","80","2180411"
"15966","It's a no-holds-barred account of the sadistic fourth estater played cunningly by Burt Lancaster.","80","51036"
"15967","It's a tale told with considerable warmth and humour, some spiffing explosions and a multiple-hanky act of self-sacrifice to round things off.","80","84726"
"15968","If ""No Country For Old Men"" was vintage port, Burn After Reading is a shot of tequila: eye watering and hard to swallow, but the after-effect is terrific.","80","887883"
"15969","Faithful to his title, Andrey Zvyagintsev (Leviathan) deivers a cruel, desolate, unforgiving image of Russia’s new middle class, ruled by selfishness, greed, frustration, envy, anger and anxiety in Loveless.","80","6304162"
"15970","For a supposed mainstream movie, Kubrick’s The Shining isn’t very audience friendly. Half the time you have to guess what the hell is going on, and if you're not familiar with Kubrick's narrative style you’ll be completely lost.","80","81505"
"15971","If the film isn’t quite as inventive as the game-changing horror that was Cabin in the Woods (which boasted Joss Whedon as co-scripter), it’s infused with affection and craft.","80","6628394"
"15972","It would be near-impossible to love Louisa May Alcott’s Little Women more than Greta Gerwig does.","80","3281548"
"15973","Baz Luhrmann takes the audience on a unique ride through one of the Bard's best-known texts, illuminating the story, occasionally subjugating the language but always delivering a vision that is bold, brassy, hugely inventive and accessible and, in a strange way, just right.","80","117509"
"15974","A cliffhanger with no real ending. When the lights come up, think of it as the start of a six-month intermission. For better and worse, Reloaded leaves you hungry for more.","80","234215"
"15975","The film is full of relevant insights into the kinds of compromises, trade-offs, and combinations of skills and personalities that produce media, and the personal stories are deftly integrated.","80","92699"
"15976","Well-made fictions like Fatal Attraction prosper because they seem more persuasive than fact.","80","93010"
"15977","Overall, a solid piece of film that not only entertains but also educates.","80","140352"
"15978","The style of the film, lush and traditional, is nothing special, but the takeaway, a daily struggle for dignity, is impossibly moving.","80","453562"
"15979","Mopey, draggy, and absurdly self-important, the movie nonetheless twangs at some resonant affective chord. This viewer, at least, was catapulted back to that moment of adolescence when being mopey, draggy, and absurdly self-important felt like a passionate act of liberation.","80","1259571"
"15980","Only one filmmaking team should be allowed to make sequels: The Naked Gun people. In Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult, they reach maximum velocity immediately. Naked 3 sets such a great pace at the beginning, it can't possibly keep up. Inevitably, the movie has its slower sections, coming almost to a halt in a slapstick finale at the Oscars. But wherever you are in the story, there's always something funny coming at you.","80","110622"
"15981","As a gallery of the grotesque, however, the cinematic equivalent of a Joe Coleman painting or Adam Parfrey publication, The Salton Sea is a blast.","80","235737"
"15982","Roger Corman could only dream of producing a movie this stupefyingly gory and loaded with exposed flesh, making the updated Piranha that most unlikely of remakes-an improvement.","80","464154"
"15983","Good, gory fun.","80","106449"
"15984","Jack O’Connell’s, wiry, indefatigable Zamperini holds your attention without effort.","80","1809398"
"15985","It is not as exciting as Star Wars itself, which had the advantage of novelty. But it is better and more satisfying than The Empire Strikes Back, which suffered from a hectic, muddled pace, together with the classic problems of being the second act in a three-act play.","80","86190"
"15986","The movie’s equal-opportunity irreverence makes for a welcome addition to the bachelor-party genre, so often aimed at the frat-boy crowds.","80","3564472"
"15987","By far the best Twilight film to date, Slade should satisfy the fan base while opening up the series to more sceptical viewers…","80","1325004"
"15988","In Farrell and Kidman, he has found two performers who are utterly willing to go the whole hog and their performances are brilliant deadpans.","80","5715874"
"15989","Goes a long way in bringing sexy back to a soggy genre, benefiting greatly from the presence of its likable leads.","80","1632708"
"15990","The Spy Who Shagged Me is impossible-to-resist summer fun that left me feeling, dare I say, randy for more? Oh, behave.","80","145660"
"15991","The characters are so vivid that the suspense never lags. Crowe is best in buttoned-down roles like this one, and he holds the husband's fear and resolve in balance.","80","1458175"
"15992","It's an expertly made, intentionally minor movie, though when Monroe, doping herself with everything available, lies in bed, confused and hapless, there are depressing intimations of the end to come.","80","1655420"
"15993","One of the most chillingly effective visions of the world’s end ever put on screen -- and a heart-rending study of parenthood, to boot.","80","898367"
"15994","The Maltese Falcon is really a triumph of casting and wonderfully suggestive character detail; the visual style, with its exaggerated vertical compositions, is striking but not particularly expressive, and its thematics are limited to intimations of absurdism (which, when they exploded in Beat the Devil, turned out to be fairly punk). But who can argue with Bogart's glower or Mary Astor in her ratty fur?","80","33870"
"15995","The movie delivers its share of shudders, along with fabulous arias of anger, wrath and disgust from both actors as the power dynamic bounces back and forth.","80","7984734"
"15996","U.N.C.L.E. has enough style and smarts to make it an amusingly louche summer movie: a cultivated mix of action and wit, suits and cities, that feels refreshingly analogue in a digital world.","80","1638355"
"15997","Mesmerizing dark fable, which also contains moments of comedy and action that don't disrupt its oddly earnest tone","80","217869"
"15998","This gritty sci-fi is undeservedly neglected and underrated.","80","82869"
"15999","This melancholy romance is the first Almodovar feature I’ve ever really liked, an expertly fashioned melodrama that steers mercifully clear of his usual puckishness and star-mongering.","80","913425"
"16000","Magnificent romantic-gothic corn, full of Alfred Hitchcock's humor and inventiveness.","80","32976"
"16001","What begins as a spirited but safely familiar pastiche of John Hughes and Wes Anderson is compelled to become its own thing, Gomez-Rejon’s film embracing the most tired tropes of stereotypical YA weepies so that it can kiss them goodbye.","80","2582496"
"16002","The Last of the Mohicans isn't a classic, but it's one of the most exciting action pictures to come along in recent memory.","80","104691"
"16003","The exploitation title may not do it any favors, but this biopic based on the incredible life journey of Sam Childers is gripping, inspirational and well told.","80","1586752"
"16004","If it doesn't ultimately engage your heart as it might, Anna Karenina is period drama at its most exciting, intoxicating and modern. Spellbinding.","80","1781769"
"16005","A genuinely engrossing film.","80","765443"
"16006","With a superb lead turn by rising star Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Rian Johnson’s debut is a smart, original neo-noir that works as an ingenious mindgame as well as a slick Hollywood calling card.","80","393109"
"16007","Emily Blunt shines as the tough-minded British queen in this lush, and even sexy, period romance","80","962736"
"16008","The film’s real ferocity is saved for the ideologues of terror.","80","4882376"
"16009","Their monumentally stupid and childish observations burst like water balloons over the heads of everyone they encounter; the movie plays like a dumbed-down ""Animal House,"" and its idiocy is irresistible.","80","115641"
"16010","With In Bruges, the British gangster movie gets a Croydon facelift. It may not be new, but it’s a wonderfully fresh take on a familiar genre: fucked-up, far-out and very, very funny.","80","780536"
"16011","An exceptionally touching and provocative love story. [15 January 1999, Calendar, p. F-4]","80","132512"
"16012","Ultimately, My Best Friend's Wedding works for some very old-fashioned reasons: It skillfully engages us in the story and its characters. And, for no additional cost, it has something to say about how we live, act, commit and relate.","80","119738"
"16013","Aquaman is worth seeing if only for its original visuals and the grand vision from director James Wan. As a whole, it is a bit of a mess and ends up being an exhausting experience that would’ve benefited from some judicious editing.","80","1477834"
"16014","The fact that they could all lay down their weapons and finish the deal heightens Wheatley’s generally irreverent approach, all of which serves to remind that guns don’t kill people; insecure, overcompensating idiots do.","80","4158096"
"16015","This was controversial at the time and that put alot of people off, believing that the film was probably all hype, but this is a respectful and complex work of fiction around the concepts of the biblical character and his life.","80","95497"
"16016","Unlike the thick directness in Maud’s work, the movie about her is almost pointillist in detailing the tiny steps that make up an enduring marriage.","80","3721954"
"16017","Alfred Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train is an expertly made thriller with fluid camera work, dark humor and enough cliff-hanging build up to keep you biting your nails until there's nothing left. Easily one of Hitch's most underrated films.","80","44079"
"16018","Wind River can be thrilling and it owns the ability to surprise and shock throughout.","80","5362988"
"16019","The result is both sober and inspiring: an urban progress report taking into account a plethora of government services, scutinized by Wiseman’s patient but unblinking eye.","80","12094720"
"16020","Brutal, bloody, terrifying, astonishing... And so tense it'll leave you aching. The most significant Brit chiller since ""28 Days Later.""","80","435625"
"16021","Triple Frontier is a solid, engrossing genre item with designs on being something more. It doesn’t quite get there but it does well enough along the way to make the journey worth taking.","80","1488606"
"16022","From Russia with Love is a preposterous, skillful slab of hardhitting, sexy hokum. After a slowish start, it is directed by Terence Young at zingy pace.","80","57076"
"16023","Best of all, filmmaker Bennett Miller (Capote) uses this brainiac sports movie to remind viewers that money is neither the measure of a man nor the ultimate assessment of quality; it's a myopic metric based on past accomplishments rather than future potential. After all, success isn't always about the home runs so much as just getting on base - again, and again, and again.","80","1210166"
"16024","Jarmusch's eye for blighted landscape (he films in a grainy black and white) is hilariously sharp, and he sends his performers on their zomboid rounds with a keen sense of rhythm and interplay.","80","88184"
"16025","From the outrageously frightening opening--in which a beautiful young woman skinny-dipping in the moonlight is devoured by the unseen shark--to the claustrophobic climax aboard Quint's fishing boat, Spielberg has us in his grip and rarely lets go.","80","73195"
"16026","The pleasure of Edge of Tomorrow is that it’s not an action movie first and foremost, but rather a cheeky little puzzle picture in expensive-looking blockbuster drag.","80","1631867"
"16027","George Clooney dazzles and Jeff Bridges shines in a scattershot but often hilarious military farce.","80","1234548"
"16028","Though passionate, doesn't pity or flatter the rank and file.","80","265086"
"16029","Once again seizing control of the medium, Nolan attempts to alter the fabric of reality, or at least blow the roof off the multiplexes. Big, bold, baffling and bonkers.","80","6723592"
"16030","An exciting, intellectually stimulating science-fiction thriller which also connects emotionally. Everyone involved earns a promotion to the premiership.","80","945513"
"16031","A fast-paced, character-driven heist movie that combines robberies with romance and solidifies Affleck's reputation as an actor with a genuine gift for directing.","80","840361"
"16032","The sheer dynamism and energy of the movie are compelling, even when the character drama isn’t.","81","1677720"
"16033","Much of Guadagnino’s Suspiria feels beholden to nothing, indulgent and overwrought, existing only for itself. Art should never have to justify its own existence, but also: Why does this exist? What motivations conceived this film that seems to want very little—to maybe even dislike—the movie on which it’s based? And yet, it’s unforgettable.","81","1034415"
"16034","The film packs in so much material that it's bound to have dead ends and weak spots, but its confidence in its provocations is compelling.","81","3958780"
"16035","Has such perfect pitch in small matters that, as it builds, it proves no less capable in tackling bigger issues--and what begin as chuckles become deep belly laughs.","81","117802"
"16036","Director Steve McQueen's eye is better than his sense of pacing in the nevertheless devastating drama 12 Years a Slave, featuring a standout performance from Serenity's Chiwetel Ejiofor.","81","2024544"
"16037","The weight of graphic, grotesque violence hangs over the entire movie. But the daring emotional violence lingers longer, well after the lights go down on the final shot.","81","3315342"
"16038","Even if that’s the film’s real raison d’être—much of the screentime is given to aerial training, aerial romance, aerial battles—the result is fun and thrilling, and plenty of snappy jokes and sight gags will keep audiences of all ages entertained.","81","892769"
"16039","This is a film about the wilds — internal and external — and Saulnier shoots both the natural and the human side of the story with his usual sharp instincts for startling and engaging images.","81","5057140"
"16040","Like a particularly bad trip, Midsommar bristles with the subcutaneous need to escape, with the dread that one is trapped. In this community in the middle of nowhere, in this strange culture, in this life, in your body and its existential pain: Aster imprisons us so that when the release comes, it’s as if one’s insides are emptying cataclysmically. In the moment, it’s an assault. It’s astounding.","81","8772262"
"16041","The Founder’s biggest strength is that it doesn’t lose the story or the characters in the larger metaphor about the gap between creation and exploitation.","81","4276820"
"16042","The performances are uniformly fantastic, but I was most impressed by Wright Joseph and Nyong’o, both delivering distinct and completely unique work. Nyong’o gives a master class in acting in dual roles and is almost unrecognizable as her doppelgänger persona.","81","6857112"
"16043","Living up to the legacy of Die Hard is a tall order, and Skyscraper never reaches those heights. But it's a gigantic and silly blockbuster matinee of a movie, with likable performances, absurd action sequences, and a heck of a lot of duct tape.","81","5758778"
"16044","Bad Times at the El Royale is vibrant motion picture, in a way few films are nowadays. One might even call it indulgent, although “decadent” is probably more accurate.","81","6628394"
"16045","Bustling with manic energy, I, Tonya attempts to cobble together a variety of perspectives — including that of the filmmakers — to create a portrait of, and perhaps rejoinder to, history’s assessment of the record-breaking athlete as little more than a ’90s tabloid footnote.","82","5580036"
"16046","While her debut as a screenwriter and leading lady doesn’t quite reach the outrageous heights of her TV work, Trainwreck remains hilarious and provocative, heralding what we can only hope will be a pot-stirring new voice on the big screen.","82","3152624"
"16047","Anderson has abandoned a bit of his whimsical nature for the later portions of the film, but the film’s first half hour presents one of his most darling settings yet, until, of course, it all crumbles into murder, mayhem and bad renovations.","82","2278388"
"16048","It'll probably remind you of Jurassic Park mixed with Cloverfield, plus a dash of Aliens and a pinch of Buffy's ""Hush,"" but between its unique approach and gleeful desire to shock you, you can't really be mad at it.","82","6644200"
"16049","Using Barbakow’s direction and Andy Siara’s script as filters, Palm Springs presents viewers with a blend of soft science fiction, raucous punchlines, and human drama, the last of these encompassing self-loathing, grief, love and high anxiety.","82","9484998"
"16050","Upgrade is an intense sci-fi action thriller with big ideas, incredible action and a remarkable lead performance.","82","6499752"
"16051","Bullock’s performance is brilliant — she takes all these internalized fears and crafts a character who has already disconnected from emotion. Throughout the films, she challenges what “maternal” means in circumstances this dire.","82","2737304"
"16052","Victoria & Abdul is worth seeing for Dench’s magisterial performance and for Frears’s light but sure directorial touch. Just don’t mistake it for actual history.","82","5816682"
"16053","A smart, sometimes pissingly funny romantic comedy that is also oddly unmoving and predictable in spots.","82","125439"
"16054","This is certainly the best studio movie of the new year to date, and Douglas might even be remembered at next year's Oscars.","82","185014"
"16055","This is a film that’s proudly impertinent but also deeply morally serious. And even if Three Billboards doesn’t always hold together, that’s appropriate for its anxious characters who are, themselves, a little unsteady.","82","5027774"
"16056","The blood-slicked, vividly drawn film universe John Wick illustrates is such a generous slice of pulp that, even if not original, per se, it exudes a confidence rarely seen these days, surefire franchises be damned.","82","2911666"
"16057","Though this menu is clearly by design, the result is both a meal that feels less than the sum of its parts and individual courses that themselves feel somehow undercooked. I found myself simultaneously wanting both more and less.","82","6412452"
"16058","Best of all are the car chases, which Wright choreographs with the same blend of wit and technical finesse he brought to the pool-cue, “Don’t Stop Me Now” zombie rumble in Shaun of the Dead.","82","3890160"
"16059","Black Panther might be the first MCU film that could claim to most clearly be an expression of a particular director’s voice.","82","1825683"
"16060","Jolie can’t decide whether she wants to be a poet or a field reporter, and the combination results in an important story that’s frequently, breathtakingly beautiful but ultimately more admirable than affecting.","82","4882376"
"16061","It captures the excitement of a breaking star, it generates a raw and unsettling emotional power and it honors the aesthetic of hip-hop in way that's never quite been done on film before.","83","298203"
"16062","The French are very much the villains of the saga and, naturally, have always hated the movie (it was banned in Paris until 1971); and it remains controversial in other quarters as well because it seems to embrace, even celebrate, terrorism as a political tool.","83","58946"
"16063","Tragic news for anyone who’s sick of superhero movies: Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse completely reinvigorates the genre, reaffirms why it’s resonating with a diverse modern audience that’s desperate to fight the power, and reiterates to us how these hyper-popular spandex myths are able to reinvent themselves on the fly whenever things get stale.","83","4633694"
"16064","Mortensen, who reportedly put on thirty pounds for the role, starts out playing Tony like a big lug but as the road trip ensues he brings all sorts of subtle shadings to the role. He even comes to appreciate Doc’s artistry. In Tony’s eyes, he’s right up there with Liberace.","83","6966692"
"16065","Witty, observational, and hilarious, Maggie’s Plan is the kind of richly complex dramedy that proves to be the rare picture that serves both halves of that genre description fully, equally, and satisfyingly.","83","3471098"
"16066","The chemical energy between Bullock and Reynolds is fresh and irresistible.","83","1041829"
"16067","Director Peter Landesman, who also helmed last year’s political thriller ""Kill the Messenger"", doesn’t color much outside the lines of conventional drama. But his straightforward telling actually serves the strong cast and taut script — and a story that would be deemed too outrageous to believe if it wasn’t true.","83","3322364"
"16068","Even when that story drags, Moonrise Kingdom could be appreciated on mute.","83","1748122"
"16069","A smart, eminently watchable thriller, taut and stylish, and Plummer is remarkably good in it.","83","5294550"
"16070","Best of all is the bad guy. Javier Bardem was always a tantalizing choice to play a Bond villain, and his Silva is a terrific creation, and certainly the most memorable villain in the series in decades.","83","1074638"
"16071","Nobody is better at capturing the crushing banality of everyday life than Judge.","83","1225822"
"16072","This movie has everything up its sleeve and presto chango at its core, ending in defiance to the plot's established logic before viewers realize they've been had.","83","1670345"
"16073","By rocketing ahead 200 years from the previous film and jiggering the story cleverly (with a script by Toy Story coscreenwriter Joss Whedon as late-'90s wiseacreish as Alien3 was early-'90s portentous) to create a Ripley reconstructed through a mix of human and alien DNA, Alien Resurrection power-kicks the whole definition of the Horrifying Other into a fresh, deep, exhilaratingly thoughtful, millennium-sensitive direction. [5 Dec 1997, p. 47]","83","118583"
"16074","Finally, a horror film that doesn't turn on the gore machine nor confuse dread with decibels. One of the most convincing members of the cast is the gloriously creaky old house that sets up the spooky action. [23 July 1999, p.03]","83","171363"
"16075","Feels like a lost film from the '60s in the very best way: unstructured and intrepid and free. As a result, it's sometimes a little indulgent and overlong. But, like its hero, it's never less than sincere in its search for truth and beauty, even as it stares death in the eye.","83","758758"
"16076","The first film that comes close to capturing the Bohemian flair and everyman accents of Generation X life while remaining a first-rate piece of entertainment. Stiller and his knowing screenwriter Helen Childress fashioned a wise, very funny film that brightens the slow early going of 1994. [18 Feb 1994, p.6]","83","110950"
"16077","There's something inherently funny about the romantic predicament of Harry and Ron and Hermione. As if it wasn't bad enough having to deal with the Dark Lord and the Death Eaters and all the rest, now they have to square off against... raging hormones.","83","417741"
"16078","This is a film that is quietly confident. Everything's well-composed. Everything's put together right. There's a very sure hand on the wheel here, and at this point, I'm sold on Rupert Wyatt as a guy who can tell a story with a certain kind of intelligence, both towards his subject and towards his audience.","83","2039393"
"16079","The moody tone and carefully balanced drama turn a grubby premise into something unexpectedly elegant.","83","476964"
"16080","Bale's live-wire performance typifies the many major and minor elements that elevate The Fighter from the deeply conventional sports movie it might have been into the endearingly offbeat sports movie it turns out to be.","83","964517"
"16081","Land of the Dead is huge. It's Romero doing what he does best: using zombies to create a lowbrow social parable. It shows up junk like ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" for the brainless pap it is. And it's got something that even the best previous ""Dead"" films have lacked: good acting.","83","418819"
"16082","It’s not a flawless movie, but there’s real magic in it, and that’s more important, and no less rare, than perfection.","83","4302938"
"16083","It's a psychological thriller that actually thrills.","83","167404"
"16084","The film moves with strange, creepy energy and is populated by characters who delicately walk a line between charm and grotesquerie. It's a treat.","83","1228987"
"16085","The Duchess of Langeais is a romantic dance of death.","83","781435"
"16086","At its core, it's an exploration of the demands and obligations of brotherly love, staged with honesty, originality and a surprising spark of intelligence.","83","498399"
"16087","Honoring the literary ground beneath it, spotted yellow lizards and all, the movie Holes is easy to dig.","83","311289"
"16088","For much of its going, Up in the Air moves with the same refreshing pace and attitude that marked Reitman's ""Thank You for Smoking"" and ""Juno"" -- with the added frisson that the subject matter is so torn-from-the-headlines that it feels, in a good way, like reality TV.","83","1193138"
"16089","Something particularly clean shines in this American fairy tale, a quality of simplicity that's almost as hard to achieve in such movies as a middle-aged man's boyhood dreams.","83","265662"
"16090","Lurid and voluptuous pulp fun, with a sensationalistic fairy-tale allure. You can't take it too seriously, but you can't tear your eyes away from it, either.","83","947798"
"16091","As Cecil, Whitaker is mesmerizing. The actor seems to shrink into his imposing frame, summoning a performance of quiet, bottled-up force.","83","1327773"
"16092","It’s fascinating to watch Mitchell grasp for a bigger picture with the wild ambition of his scruffy protagonist.","83","5691670"
"16093","The film is anchored by yet another hypnotically complex Cumberbatch performance. He's turning greatness into a habit.","83","2084970"
"16094","Amour is nevertheless the work of a filmmaker who isn't afraid to ask the big questions about human nature, and coming out of Amour it seems the director has hope for us yet.","83","1602620"
"16095","Its script is sharp, its dialogue is acerbic, its stars could hardly be better and, in its more sparkling moments, it exudes some of the flavor and charm of the later Hepburn-Tracy comedies.","83","337741"
"16096","Through it all, Vicky Cristina Barcelona remains unaccountably romantic, a confirmation that love, elusive and painful as it can be, is still worth pursuing.","83","497465"
"16097","The Coens get their cake and eat it, too: The lavish period details, paired with marvelous song-and-dance routines, work on their own terms while a firm self-awareness looms over every scene. It's a tricky balance indicative of directors who know exactly what they're going for: An old-fashioned homage to classic Hollywood and a send-up of the very same thing.","83","475290"
"16098","It's a lesson that African-American culture offers more inspiring stories than Hollywood has chosen to tell.","83","4846340"
"16099","Robbie, for her part, has never been better. Making the most of her first leading role since Z for Zachariah, she does a brilliant job of skating along the thin line that runs between glory and the gutter. Sympathetic but not too sympathetic, her performance is all that allows the film to maintain its tenuous hold over its queasy tragicomedy.","83","5580036"
"16100","Brigsby Bear offers a touching and daringly unconventional reminder of how no approach to filmmaking is inherently bad with the right mind at the helm.","83","5805752"
"16101","Wells purists may balk, and Pal’s then state-of-the-art effects do look cheesy by today’s Industrial Light & Magic standards, but The Time Machine retains an appealing Victorian charm. Taylor, the Mel Gibson of the ’60s, is a pleasure to watch.","83","54387"
"16102","At its heart, The Martian is an unapologetically stirring celebration of our ability, as a species, to solve even the most daunting problems via rational thought, step by step by step. It’s basically ""Human Ingenuity: The Movie.""","83","3659388"
"16103","A puzzle of a highly rarefied order. At times it's enthrallingly clever and subtle; at others it's borderline incomprehensible.","83","1340800"
"16104","The movie misfires: It's numbingly cold and soulless, and the zeitgeist stays far beyond its reach. But it's so visually striking you almost don't notice, its relentlessly somber mood has a certain masochistic appeal and, while hardly a career-redefining performance, Hanks is as winning as ever.","83","257044"
"16105","Moon doesn't arrive with a train of ballyhoo, but its quiet charms easily drowns out the clatter of bigger, dumber pictures.","83","1182345"
"16106","Beneath all of his bad-boy shtick, Apatow’s always been a pretty conventional moralist. But Schumer gives their raunchy rom-com enough of her signature spikiness to prevent it from ever feeling predictable.","83","3152624"
"16107","Despite a few places where the air of déjà vu is a bit too thick, it's a class act, with a textured script, one of the series' more stunning title sequences.","83","143145"
"16108","A spellbinding action-drama, skillfully built upon a scary corporate conspiracy, chock-full of enjoyable downbeat performances.","83","465538"
"16109","The meat of Suburbicon is certainly Grade-A, but no expense has been spared on the trimmings either. Even the briefest supporting players are fully formed and often quite memorable.","83","491175"
"16110","Like ""All The President’s Men,"" it’s a muckraker movie that celebrates the power of the press by actually showing journalists doing their job, pen and notebook in hand.","83","1895587"
"16111","It doesn't break ground like ""Seven"" or ""Fight Club""; it's not a thrill ride like ""Panic Room."" But it's a mature, thoughtful and full-bodied movie that compensates for the demands it makes with the rewards of craftsmanship, rigor, skill and art.","83","443706"
"16112","The Prestige isn't art, but it reaps a lot of fun out of the question, How did they do that?","83","482571"
"16113","Enough Said is another tremendously well crafted, intelligent dramedy about people, with complicated lives, who make bad decisions trying to do the right thing.","83","2390361"
"16114","If the screenplay’s sense of scale can begin to feel limited by an overfamiliarity in environment, it’s suddenly made expansive with the realization of how much these places are extensions of these five people’s lives and personalities.","83","4385888"

"16116","Another thinking-person's thriller from director Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland, also co-pilots on ""28 Days Later.""","83","448134"
"16117","It’s an aesthetically addicting experience that capitalizes on these seasonal feelings, offering an unlikely escape with the press of a button.","83","107688"
"16118","What makes Sing Street such a joyously entertaining film (besides the songs) is that it thinks the best of its characters, and it presents them the way they’d like to think of themselves.","83","3544112"
"16119","it’s consistently funny and inventive.","83","102510"
"16120","Steinfeld’s performance and the script from Kelly Fremon Craig have created a young woman who feels entirely familiar, while never feeling like a retread of the other teenagers who have walked the cinematic high school halls before her.","83","1878870"

"16124","Graeme and Clive, representatives of a nation of nonbelievers in UFOs and big dinner portions, come to the psychic capital of a country that wants to believe, and they're transformed. In Paul, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost do likewise, in celebration of what the Spielbergian cosmos is all about.","83","1092026"
"16125","I wish that the Mexican drug cartel subplot was not so overwrought and Oliver Stone-ish, and the decision to shoot much of the film ""Cops""-style is also problematic. But the film puts you right inside an everyday inferno and, to its credit, doesn't turn down the heat.","83","1855199"
"16126","It's bleak, credulity straining and often stomach-turning, but it definitely works as a heart-tugging character study, and Rourke's performance as the has-been title character is golden.","83","1125849"

"16131","Big, wonderfully oddball, sometimes confounding and beautiful, Inherent Vice supplies good dosages of stoner giggles. But its doobage is potent and reflects some heavy ideas you’ll need to unpack and meditate on for a long while.","83","1791528"

"16135","Somehow the filmmakers found lightheartedness and – gasp – laughs in a story of political intrigue at the top of the notoriously buttoned-up Catholic Church.","83","8404614"
"16136","Chronicle becomes what ""Hancock"" wanted to be - a dark superhero story with firm footing in the everyday. Perhaps now the found-footage gimmick has been fully exploited; let us never speak of it again.","83","1706593"
"16137","Brad Pitt gives one of his best performances as Sgt. Don “Wardaddy” Collier, a tank commander with a passion for killing Nazis.","83","2713180"
"16138","Overall, Noah represents a respectful take on an old story by filmmakers who pose a pertinent question. The Creator promises never again to wipe humanity off the face of the Earth, signing that covenant with the cheering image of a rainbow. Does that mean he won’t let us wipe ourselves out millennia later, if we’re hell-bent on doing so?","83","1959490"
"16139","Colette is ultimately a feminist tale, but never one that wallows in self-pity or seriousness. It is also carried along lightly by a script with a streak of wit.","83","5437928"
"16140","As entertaining as it is a viable, political message destined to make viewers rethink their stance on war.","83","120188"
"16141","Only the combined talents of both Blanchett and Mara can make the film's powerfully realized finale work.","83","2402927"
"16142","Engaging characters, an unforced pro-girl agenda and amusing songs make this at least the equal to last year’s “Brave.”","83","2294629"
"16143","The film is a gem, especially for anyone yearning for a superhero film that gleefully torches the familiar “good versus evil” formula and introduces far more sinister sensibilities.","83","7752126"
"16144","What They Had is an indie drama of a familiar cut, delivered so well that you’ll forgive its smaller inconsistencies.","83","6662736"
"16145","Despite its sharp feminist sting, Big Eyes never loses its light touch. Maybe the lesson here is that Burton should venture out of his dark, creepy comfort zone more often.","83","1126590"
"16146","Tom Hooper, who directed ""The King's Speech,"" is not great with action and big set pieces, but he gets the job done. What makes Les Misérables work are the up-close moments when he can focus on performance and song.","83","1707386"
"16147","The disarming comedic tone -- silly and novel in its lack of cynicism -- is driven by the fearless, cheerful unself-consciousness of Will Ferrell, a big man last seen streaking (all too unself-consciously) through ''Old School.''","83","319343"
"16148","PP2 sometimes feels less like a movie than a two-hour episode of Glee ghostwritten by Amy Schumer; jokes fly like they’re being shot from T-shirt guns at a gonzo pep rally, and not all of them stick the landing.","83","2848292"
"16149","Velvet Buzzsaw may not be visionary, but it’s a ton of fun.","83","7043012"
"16150","It still stands up as a solid little poker movie, setting up the template for many imitators to come.","83","59037"
"16151","In the parlance of the kids today, the movie totally goes there.","83","884328"
"16152","the film isn't always successful at justifying its heft, repeating the central father-daughter tension innumerable times before the pair finally start to make some progress. It's only thanks to the two actors' extraordinary authenticity that the film continues to work as long as it does.","83","4048272"
"16153","The resulting adrenaline-packed vehicle delivers a multi-directional sugar rush. It moves so quickly that the bells and whistles blur together.","83","993842"
"16154","That it's based on a true spying case seems almost incidental. The heart of the picture is the human drama.","83","401997"
"16155","The Breakfast Club meets Rear Window. The result should satisfy dating crowds from high school to night school.","83","486822"
"16156","Fans of Kwan’s books will not be disappointed by Chu’s adaptation, as “Crazy Rich Asians” lovingly brings to life some of the novel’s standout scenes, even as Chiarelli and Lim’s screenplay snips away subplots that detract from Rachel’s journey.","83","3104988"
"16157","As the relationship between Theodore and Samantha evolves, it hews too closely to the expected arc of a romantic drama. In a desire to show how such a pairing could produce the same joys, sorrows, jealousies and insecurities as a human-to-human one, the movie edges close to parody, which it doesn't want to be.","83","1798709"
"16158","The script is well-structured, refined, and satisfying, and the direction is sure-handed. Not to mention, it's refreshing to have lesser-seen romances and different kinds of friendships on screen. Emotional and entertaining, I’ll See You In My Dreams is a sweet and sensitive tale.","83","3236120"
"16159","Sam Elliott, Marcia Gay Harden, and Judy Greer supply sharp cameos, but this is Tomlin’s movie, and she obliges with a spiky, refreshingly unvarnished performance.","83","4270516"
"16160","Melding the anxiety of the unknown and the fear of who we truly are in our core, all that we try and compartmentalize emotionally as human beings, Gray crafts a movie that is deeply personal, thought-provoking, and thrilling.","83","2935510"
"16161","An underrated entry in the horror subgenre, generating consistent unease through long, ominous pans—up and down staircases, through hallways—that assume the perspective of its searching-for-peace specter.","83","80516"
"16162","The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected) isn’t the wittiest or most exciting movie that Noah Baumbach has ever made, but it might just be the most humane.","83","5536736"
"16163","Positioned somewhere between sitcom and piercing human drama, The Kids Are All Right, is both overtly familiar and cutting edge.","83","842926"
"16164","On their own, each segment of Room is tense and emotional. But they’re even better placed back-to-back.","83","3170832"
"16165","Let’s just say the film — scripted by Bader’s nephew Daniel Stiepelman with the Justice’s blessing — successfully splits the difference between capturing Ginsburg as a contemporary folk hero and as a fiercely ambitious intellectual competing for footing in an era when mixing a killer martini was the very height of wifely prestige. No one will mistake it for a documentary.","83","4669788"
"16166","Roberts, in her most forceful dramatic performance, allows us to take in every moment through fresh, impassioned eyes.","83","195685"
"16167","This film thankfully isn’t a dramatic piece gunning for awards glory, but rather a heartwarming adventure through the emotional landscape of a child unsure how to live. It is very sentimental, but that’s kind of the point.","83","3416532"
"16168","Episodic and, at times, overwrought. And occasionally its deliberate opacity becomes too cloudy. But the things that shine through are remarkable. War is indeed Hell, it tells us, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing if you're filled with demons.","83","887912"
"16169","The Purge manages to be smart, scary, and subversive.","83","2184339"
"16170","As good as Willis is, he's no match for Mos Def.","83","450232"
"16171","As fraught with drama as this powder keg of heightened circumstances may be, make no mistake, The Wife is more than an actor’s showcase. The film itself is superb, a ticking time-bomb of simmering tension which benefits from the audience knowing as little as possible in advance.","83","3750872"
"16172","It's the kind of story that can look pedestrian on paper, but when brought to life this skillfully, proves to be genuinely inspiring.","83","1278379"
"16173","The movie's perfectly understated, warts-and-all sense of time and place will send any suburban Gen Xer in the audience flashing right back to their less-cautious days, when mix tapes did heavy lifting as calling cards.","83","1659337"
"16174","A lot of good actors have gone to work for the Coens and ended up looking like puppets, but Hanks is too clever for that. He knows that he's playing a concoction rather than a human being.","83","335245"
"16175","It's an absorbing, progressively unsettling and ultimately very inspiring biographical reflection that, in the interest of creating its subject's internal landscape, plays some chilling tricks on its audience.","83","268978"
"16176","Hill’s story suggests equal parts “Freaks and Geeks,” “Kids,” and the adolescent-focused narratives of British director Shane Meadows, but Hill cribs from these precedents with a confidence that injects this lively snapshot of skateboarding reprobates with fresh confidence.","83","5613484"
"16177","With Elysium, Blomkamp has made good on the promise of ""District 9"" and proven that working on a bigger canvas doesn't mean compromising on smarts or aspirations to deliver tentpole sized stories with a thoughtful backbone.","83","1535108"
"16178","Tampa Bay wears fringe nihilism well, including wet-fever dreams of trigger-happy angels floating on cannabis clouds and dusted with cocaine like beignets waiting to be licked clean. Or drug gangstas sporting cornrows and gold-grill teeth, living large and thinking three-ways. Film as a fetish tool, that's what Spring Breakers is all about, y'all.","83","2101441"
"16179","If you accept that Rambo is not the same kind of movie as First Blood and watch it on its own merits, it’s a badass action movie.","83","89880"
"16180","As off-kilter affecting as we found its nostalgia for a world of charm and dash that really only ever existed in the movies, and as terrific as almost all of the performances are, as a whole package it fell just slightly short of the promise of its parts.","83","2278388"
"16181","Powell and Loy's light, witty, unflappable characterizations became the unwavering backbone of a terrific series.","83","25878"
"16182","It's a beautiful and understated performance, one that hums with a richer, quieter music than Smith has mustered before.","83","454921"
"16183","It's smashing fun, nonetheless, made with razor wit and continual invention and far, far fresher than not only Hollywood buddy-cop movies but also Hollywood's own spoofs of them.","83","425112"
"16184","The difference between Lights Out and any other mainstream horror movie is that it actually uses the dark as the center of its plot, organically drawing out the majority of its jump scares in the process.","83","4786282"
"16185","It’s part raw and ugly character study, part ensemble comedy, but it’s that first element that is so striking, bold and unnerving, while the latter element is sometimes amusing, but familiar.","83","2334873"
"16186","Much has been made about the fact that the world's most popular fictional children are growing up and straight into that horror-filled no man's land of the human life span, puberty.","83","304141"
"16187","The clock is always ticking in 1917, and even as MacKay is offering a heartbreaking study in restrained emotion, he’s still at least moving towards the end goal of his terrible task. There’s no time to pause, even for great beauty, a lesson that even 1917 is often loathe to honor.","83","8579674"
"16188","It's as if we were watching one of those buddy-buddy bromances told, this time, from the perspective of the woman who is normally on the sidelines of the men's attentions and affections. It's a welcome angle.","83","1405365"
"16189","van Dormael’s vivid visual sense and genuine curiosity about the nature of love and life, time and death, make it well worth surrendering to his imagination for a while.","83","485947"
"16190","Kevin Kline is sweetly befuddled as a good man caught between worlds, and Sigourney Weaver, as a hard, sexy adulteress, makes her wit sting.","83","119349"
"16191","Animal Kingdom joins in the tradition of brutally unsentimental Australian crime dramas like ""The Boys,"" in which the stakes are low, except to the people staring down the barrel of a gun.","83","1313092"
"16192","Vox Lux is a powerful, haunting film in part because Portman is a powerful, haunting presence — you can’t turn away from her, even if you occasionally want to.","83","5960374"
"16193","How to Train Your Dragon 2 is how to make a sequel, when it gets its head out of the clouds.","83","1646971"
"16194","The film is full of panache, from its sexy French score to its glistening gin martinis, and it weaponizes style, using it to keep audiences off balance as the mystery unfolds.","83","7040874"
"16195","Effortless fun: It plays like a giddy horror movie with its laughs wrapped in couture gowns.","83","458352"
"16196","The symbolic power of what happened there — one small step, one giant leap for womankind — is still the movie’s truest ace.","83","4622512"
"16197","Blessed with some firm hands on the terror tiller and a winning cast, Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark is a handsome, and deliciously horrible, horror movie.","83","3387520"
"16198","Above all, Last Flag Flying illustrates a fascinating link between Ashby and Linklater, two filmmakers from different eras who both explore American society’s capacity to alienate the same people contributing to its identity. That gloomy proposition finds a fresh tone in Linklater’s hands, where angry, disillusioned people still manage to find room to laugh.","83","6018306"
"16199","Then the carnage comes, and when it does, it delivers on all promises and more, with a parade of gushing wounds, demonic howls, and oceans of gore which approach the line of good taste, toe it, then gleefully dance across. [22 Sept 2010]","83","83907"
"16200","Notorious makes the death of Biggie Smalls look like a tragic mistake, instead of the outgrowth of a culture devoted to selling the fantasy of who's the biggest man.","83","472198"
"16201","It’s material primed for mushiness, yet Eastwood shrewdly marries sentimentality to both self-deprecating humor (including a late bullhorn gag) and darker, more desolate undercurrents.","83","107808"
"16202","The Frighteners is also that rare horror film that actually gets better as it proceeds; this scare machine has a heart and a brain.","83","116365"
"16203","In this quiet, absorbing, shades-of-gray drama, a kind of thriller meditation on the schism in Northern Ireland, we get the story of not one but two powerfully opposing heroes.","83","118972"
"16204","The Sandlot lays down life’s little lessons with the feathery touch of a sacrifice bunt. During the ball-retreiving scenes, as the gang learns to work as a team off the field, the movie never loses its quick pace or its sense of fun. Old baseball wisdom: The best teams win with strong fundamentals. So do the best movies.","83","108037"
"16205","The Last Boy Scout is a guilty pleasure by any standard, but I’ve seen plenty of guilt-free movies lately that aren’t this much fun.","83","102266"
"16206","Fortunately, directing duo Kevin Kolsch and Dennis Widmyer get everything absolutely right in their bone-chillingly effective new remake.","83","837563"
"16207","Motherless Brooklyn is the sort of risk-taking effort that deserves kudos whether it works or not. As it happens, this lengthy film-noir labour of love by writer, director and star Edward Norton, is well worth the ride.","83","385887"
"16208","It's a film full of clever moments that may at first seem cheeky but come to feel inspired, with a third act (which only a churl would describe) that rises to a dizzyingly heightened level of metaphysics and mayhem.","83","1259521"
"16209","As an exercise in classical scare tactics, delivered through an escalating series of primo setpieces, The Conjuring is often supremely effective.","83","1457767"
"16210","There are more compelling stories to be found in the comic book world, and there are more expressive directors than Jon Favreau. But on the bases of wit, verve, spirit and whiz-bangery, it's pretty tough to find fault with.","83","371746"
"16211","Prometheus is an unquestionable good time, one of the best big-screen science fiction accomplishments since 'Avatar.'","83","1446714"
"16212","It runs too long and drags a bunch in its final third, but make no mistake: This is Spielberg’s biggest crowdpleaser in years, a CGI ride that wields the technology with an eye for payoff.","83","1677720"
"16213","All Is Lost is a taut, superbly crafted addition to the survival story genre.","83","2017038"
"16214","In its best sequences, Ramsay puts her duress in dazzlingly visual terms, collapsing the past and present in an associative rush of red-streaked images and piercingly vivid moments out of time.","83","1242460"
"16215","Chaganty and co-writer Sev Ohanian deliver wonders on both the technical and narrative ends of Search, but editors Will Merrick and Nick Johnson do an astounding job as well.","83","7668870"
"16216","Lopez, for all her Latina-siren voluptuousness, has always projected a contained coolness, and this is the first movie in which it fully works for her.","83","120780"
"16217","The brilliance of Michael Mann's Manhunter is that it appreciates that the true nexus of humanity is our shared closeness.","83","91474"
"16218","Utilizing the pure physicality of a cast you can count on one hand, the movie maintains a minimalist dread throughout, with every footstep or sudden move carrying the potential for instant death.","83","6644200"
"16219","It's certainly a crowd-pleaser...and something close to a triumph, if not an unqualified one.","83","2431286"
"16220","How is Invictus as a sports movie? Let's just say that its lump-in-the-throat climax is predictable, but that doesn't mean it's less than earned.","83","1057500"
"16221","For the record, it's truly puzzling that this film has been rated PG-13; it's much stronger than that. The monsters of ""Beowulf"" have haunted human imagination for more than a millennium; the ones in this film will easily provoke a few nightmares.","83","442933"
"16222","Is it a great movie? Maybe not. But it is a great step forward in moviemaking. Shrug it off if that makes you feel better, but starting today you live in a post-Avatar movie world.","83","499549"
"16223","Director Matthew Vaughn has provided an imperfect but still wickedly hilarious take on Mark Millar's deconstruction of superhero mythos.","83","1250777"
"16224","Somehow the movie works like a clock. Its scenes and sensibility are all more than familiar, but it exudes a kind of nostalgic spy-movie charm and, at the same time, is so fresh and free of the usual thriller nonsense that it all seems to be happening for the first time.","83","258463"
"16225","It is a film of surfaces, admittedly, but one made by perhaps our era’s best director of surfaces.","83","1034415"
"16226","Kong is brilliant in many, many places. But it overwhelms its own best qualities with its sheer, punishing size. It is, literally, too much of a good thing.","83","360717"
"16227","Watching skinny-armed little Will pretend to be the spawn of Sly Stallone in a series of botched feats of derring-do is a treat, as is much of this film.","83","845046"

"16229","The ""Citizen Kane"" of rat movies makes for a terrific overhaul in this wonderfully entertaining and, yes, touching take on that terribly confused man/child named Willard.","83","310357"
"16230","In terms of storytelling, The Avengers is for the most part a highly functional, banged-together vehicle that runs on synthetic franchise fuel. Yet the grand finale of CGI action, set in the streets of New York, is - in every sense - smashing.","83","848228"
"16231","Israel, as noted by her own writing, had a caustic wit that works with McCarthy’s comedic talents. She also brings a depth of emotion to Israel that comes to a head in a wonderfully composed scene with Grant at the end of the film.","83","4595882"
"16232","Singer deftly crafts a sleek, unusually tight film that balances comic-book adventure, pulp opera and the fear of being different.","83","120903"

"16236","A Dangerous Method is a movie believing the most formidable sex organ really is the brain.","83","1571222"
"16237","Hell, this thing is so mainstream it feels like the start of a franchise. And yet, that mass appeal is a huge part of what makes this funny and righteously furious American film so powerful.","83","7349662"
"16238","Ang Lee's film of the Jane Austen novel slavishly follows the gospel according to Merchant Ivory, swooning over characters declaiming modestly while surrounded by topiary.","83","114388"
"16239","The triumph of a film like Upgrade, an unapologetic B-movie, is that it aims low and exceeds expectations.","83","6499752"
"16240","Leaner than ""Harry Potter's"" adventures, meaner than the ""Twilight"" saga, The Hunger Games lives up to its source if not entirely the hype.","83","1392170"
"16241","The big-screen reissue offers a rare chance to admire the marvelous production details.","83","86879"
"16242","Ritchie concocts a crime-jungle demimonde that's organically linked to the real world, and it's a damn fun one to visit.","83","1032755"
"16243","Shoot the Moon doesn't reach the eccentric emotional heights of John Cassavetes's A Woman Under the Influence, perhaps the best family drama ever made. But flaws and all, it towers over most of the kiddie movies that have dominated the cinema scene for too long. It will be taken very seriously for a very long time. [28 Jan 1982, p.18]","83","84675"
"16244","It's about time that another Scream flick came along to gouge the new cliches out of their sockets. Scream 4 does it in grandly Guignol style.","83","1262416"
"16245","Burton's id explodes onto the screen with a plethora of demonic mutated critters.","83","1142977"
"16246","Alas, while the verbiage bubbles, the plot slogs. You feel that there's a big pile of deleted scenes waiting to appear on the DVD -- and that a good bit of what's here should have joined it. Funny is good, but it requires sharp if it's to rise to true greatness.","83","478311"
"16247","Melissa Leo is startlingly good...You feel like you're watching a life, not a performance.","83","978759"
"16248","Vanessa Redgrave, as the adult Briony, appears at the very end in a monologue that rounds out the film with heartbreaking force.","83","783233"
"16249","For its sheer visual gusto alone, Coraline is a wonder.","83","327597"
"16250","The casting clicks; the visuals have leaped right out of Dave Gibbons' original panels; the action is brutal, stylish and well-staged, and -- with most of the major characters, themes and symbolism are retained in an abbreviated form -- the 2 1/2-hour film makes an enjoyably esoteric Cliff's Notes version of the book.","83","409459"
"16251","What rescues the film from melodrama is that Legrand drew on extensive interviews with psychologists, emergency police personnel, female victims, and batterers. The bone-deep chill of real, observed experience cuts through this film and gives it a verity that at times reminded me of Frederick Wiseman’s harrowing documentary “Domestic Violence.”","83","6002232"
"16252","It’s almost unbelievable that something this narratively arty is being released as a mainstream horror movie, but the filmmaking ranks as some of Aronofsky’s most skillful.","83","5109784"
"16253","The longer it goes on, the more you're swept up into the jet stream of good feeling.","83","1084950"
"16254","Like Lyne's other heavy-breathers, this one has glossy production values, a relentlessly somber mood and its share of sexual gymnastics. But it's atypical and unique in the way it builds a volcano waiting to erupt with nail-biting anticipation and sympathy for all three characters.","83","250797"
"16255","The movie's as casual as its lead characters' approach to changing history; it's also lewdly and frequently laugh-out-loud hilarious -- especially if you wasted any of your youth watching a certain brand of '80s comedy schlock on HBO at 2 a.m.","83","1231587"
"16256","As in their previous comedies, Pegg and Frost play men who refuse to stop acting like boys. But these pint-swilling Peter Pans also know how to work the heart and the brain for belly laughs.","83","1213663"
"16257","Because make no mistake: The Dark Knight is many things, some of them deliriously fun, some of them deeply impressive, and some of them puzzling and frustrating. But most of all it is dark.","83","468569"
"16258","Despite the cat-and-mouse games between cop and criminal, this is less a battle of wills than one man's battle for his own soul. Nolan bravely treads where few American films dare to delve -- into the world of ambivalence and ambiguity -- and emerges with a compelling portrait.","83","278504"
"16259","Some of the effects remain nicely repulsive; Freddy himself comes across as a genuinely nasty piece of work, far removed from his later incarnation.","83","87800"
"16260","Queen & Slim is a traditional road movie with decidedly untraditional inclinations, a romance framed against stark realities. But it’s equally a political act, a film whose very existence demands questions about the ways stories like it are typically told, from whose perspective, and perhaps most valuably of all, for what audience.","83","8722346"
"16261","Philip Messina's claustrophobic sets and Cliff Martinez's elegantly creepy score add to the film's distinction and work off Clooney's performance and Soderbergh's staging to create an hypnotic spell and suggest a cosmos full of spiritual possibility.","83","307479"
"16262","In the scheme of Almodóvar’s rich catalogue, Pain is probably too small, too sad, and too obtuse to really recommend as any kind of starting point. For longtime fans, though, it’s a gift; the kind of quiet glory worth waiting a few decades for.","83","8291806"
"16263","Even as it delivers an emotional wallop, not every moment of ""Calvary"" goes down smoothly, as comedic scenes transition somewhat abruptly to tragic moments and the final reveal never reaches the heights of its Hitchockian inspirations.","83","2234003"
"16264","Johansson, fittingly, is the focus. In her face, as in the faces of Vermeer's handful of captivating subjects, the viewer intuits whole stories and worlds.","83","335119"
"16265","This may not be his signature work, but it’s Murray at the top of his game in the type of role audiences want to see him in.","83","2170593"
"16266","For this master of mindfuckery, Synecdoche, New York probably qualifies as a magnum opus, since it essentially multiplies ""Adaptation"" by an exponential factor and thus grows into a snarling, ungainly beast of self-reflexive absurdities.","83","383028"
"16267","Writer-director Ari Aster’s first feature culls from a tradition of slick, elegant genre filmmaking, making up what it lacks in originality with an impressive volume of atmospheric dread.","83","7784604"
"16268","Rush is a pretty thrilling piece of pop entertainment. It's excitingly assembled and moves like a bullet, highly engaging and nerve-wracking when it needs to be and light on its feet elsewhere.","83","1979320"
"16269","A stylish B horror movie about giant insects in the catacombs of Manhattan, it's by turns queasy, gross, terrifying, and -- never underestimate this one -- enthusiastically dumb. It's everything you want in a big-bug thriller.","83","119675"
"16270","Creed proceeds to hit the same beats as six Rocky movies preceding it, all the way to the Big Fight. But there's a difference here. This is the first Rocky movie Stallone didn't write, enabling Coogler and co-writer Aaron Covington to bring new perspective and respect.","83","3076658"
"16271","The plot doesn’t always make sense, but it doesn’t need to, so thoroughly does it convey a sense that everybody is in on something, and there is no escape.","83","71970"
"16272","It's eye candy that detonates.","83","120755"
"16273","The Death Of Stalin is a grim reminder that we are never too far away from history turning back on progress. It’s not an easy lesson to reconcile, but Iannucci at least has us laughing for a good while before delivering his devastating blow.","83","4686844"
"16274","It’s simply a very well done movie that features Maggie Smith’s best work in years (and, yes, she’s better here than any of her years on “Downton Abbey”).","83","3722070"
"16275","The movie has a real kick to it. As Paul and Annie attempt to outsmart each other, Misery gets nastier and nastier. It turns into a psychotic cat-and-mouse game, and there are some genuine shocks.","83","100157"
"16276","An unexpectedly alert teen-scream disaster chiller.","83","195714"
"16277","Even with these minor complaints, it’s hard to deny that It is anything but a triumph. The craftsmanship is impeccable, the performances incredibly strong..., and the fidelity to the source material, in spirit more than specificity, is admirable and appreciated. Had the story given even more time to breathe, it would have been one of the greatest Stephen King adaptations ever. As it stands, it’s simply a very good one.","83","1396484"
"16278","The conclusion of Bill & Ted Face the Music is pure corn, and by that point, they’ve earned it. It’s a film that’s somehow both offhand and meticulous, shaggy yet crisp, and the apparent joy of its creation is infectious. I laughed through a lot of it, and smiled through the rest. What a treat this movie is.","83","1086064"
"16279","For two hours it's a fun head trip.","83","1219289"
"16280","In amongst Joker’s fire and blood and chaos and its blackest of blackhearted laughter, there is the sense of a grotesque, green-haired genie being let out of a bottle, and whether it wreaks havoc or not, we’re not going to be able to put it back in.","83","7286456"
"16281","It's a beautifully shot, beautifully acted piece of fluff.","83","1655442"
"16282","As uneven as it can be at times in its last fifteen minutes, Marielle Heller has crafted a super promising debut that evokes the idea of unlocking the secret world of teenage girls and letting us live inside the special little jewel box if ever so briefly.","83","3172532"
"16283","Ficarra and Requa are more comfortable being bad: The nastier the film gets, the better it is.","83","1045772"
"16284","Boy Erased finds its best stuff when it matches the unabashed earnestness of Jared, and of Hedges’ performance. The film isn’t so much preaching to the converted as begging the ones who aren’t yet to finally come over and stand on the right side of history.","83","7008872"
"16285","Director John Madden and an ensemble of polished actors in their second primes make this a constant amusement and a nice alternative at the movies.","83","1412386"
"16286","It's a fascinating look into what Spielberg truly loves, but it's not so much a masterpiece as a nice milestone. [2002 re-release]","83","83866"
"16287","Many will find the subject matter disturbing, but it's clearly one of the holiday season's richest and most daring movie entries.","83","124315"
"16288","Turner cuts a hilarious swath across the screen in a courageously over-the-top performance that perfectly fits Waters' twisted vision. [15 Apr 1994, p.6]","83","111127"
"16289","It's basically the perfect summer movie, because it's designed to be.","83","2872732"
"16290","Martha Marcy May Marlene leaves a viewer hanging, quite literally, lost in an enveloping fog of mood without resolution. Olsen, meanwhile, definitely marks her arrival.","83","1441326"
"16291","Bleak, brutal and unrelentingly nihilist, and with only sporadic flashes of the blackest, most mordant humor to lighten the load, it feels parched, like the story has simply boiled away in the desert heat and all that’s left are its desiccated bones. In a good way.","83","2345737"
"16292","The Fifth Estate is flawed (it grips the brain but not the heart), yet it feverishly exposes the tenor of whistle-blowing in the brave new world, with the Internet as a billboard for anyone out to spill secrets. Call it the anti-social network.","83","1837703"
"16293","Effervescent in style, conveying a substantive message without ever devolving into saccharine preachiness.","83","1490017"
"16294","It's made with deftly unsettling genre flair.","83","265349"
"16295","District 9 fuses science fiction mayhem and biting social commentary as well as any film since ""Starship Troopers."" It’s the rare alien invasion story that has the aliens running scared.","83","1136608"
"16296","In its finer moments, however, Lee translates the book's wondrous prose into grand visual conceits meant for the big screen. Posited as a story that ""will make you believe in god,"" instead it has the power to confirm one's faith in the cinematic experience.","83","454876"
"16297","It's not so much a sequel or even a remake for a new generation of moviegoers as it's a retranslation for the old one: an irresistible statement that ""Yo, life ain't over till it's over.""","83","479143"
"16298","A lush, ambitious, strikingly outsized play on Charles Perrault’s Little Red Riding Hood that makes explicit the dangers of a budding young woman straying from the path.","83","87075"
"16299","Balancing homage with creativity, the picture is tight, stylishly filmed, clever and, importantly, scary.","83","263488"
"16300","The overall cheekiness of the film far outweighs its preachy moments. For the most part, it's a brisk, funny and engaging movie that does genuinely exciting things with little bits of string and wire and such.","83","1623288"
"16301","What makes this coming-of-age film special is that it’s at once harsh and humanist: a perceptive, realistic comedy about tweenage life that’s also rich in compassion, that scarcest of junior-high commodities.","83","7014006"
"16302","Malick clings to the promise of grace: His vision of the afterlife is a dreamy beach, enhanced by an excellent playlist of fine classical music, and promising the peace that surpasses all understanding. Plus a beautiful sky.","83","478304"
"16303","No matter its conceptual intentions, It Follows never ventures too far from visceral horror. Mitchell populates a number of scenes with well-timed jump scares as the being frequently bursts out of the shadows or appears in unexpected forms, while the score provides a screaming punctuation mark.","83","3235888"
"16304","Harold and Kumar share a quality the overgrown adolescents in films like this are never allowed to possess: They're witty, focused, and highly aware. They make having a brain look hip.","83","366551"
"16305","Effective both as Superman and as the bumbling Clark Kent, Christopher Reeve still seems ideal for the part, if for no other reason than his ability to summon up a convincing sense of intensity when charged with saving the world.","83","78346"
"16306","If nothing else, this memorable effort eloquently displays Hushpuppy's fragile understanding of her world, where the only certainty is that nothing lasts forever. That makes ""Beasts"" into a gigantic triumph even when it falls apart.","83","2125435"
"16307","Sneaks up on you. At first, it plays like it might be another in a long line of dullish legal thrillers. But then, in its modest, grown-up way, it keeps getting better and better.","83","488120"
"16308","A swankily austere piece of jeepers-creepers sci-fi.","83","289043"
"16309","Once the lady in question is overturned by a freak tidal wave the tone shifts from unintentionally comedic to undeniably exciting as renegade priest Gene Hackman leads a motley band of souls (including Ernest Borgnine, Shelley Winters, and Roddy McDowall) on their upside down quest to escape from a watery grave.","83","69113"
"16310","Kaufman and fellow director Duke Johnson strike the right balance here, deftly mixing spiritual crisis and despondency with moments of painful awkwardness and biting hilarity.","83","2401878"
"16311","The Big Short ends up an energetic, absorbing version of these events, marked deeply by its director’s uniquely surreal vision.","83","1596363"
"16312","Despite the hot-button pedophilic story hook (I'm surprised Jeff and Hayley didn't meet on MySpace.com), Hard Candy ultimately beats with the heart of a stagier, more complicated psychological revenge picture along the lines of Roman Polanski's ""Death and the Maiden.""","83","424136"
"16313","Miller's global harmonizing never feels preachy -- he's too busy cramming Happy Feet with enough entertainment for three movies.","83","366548"
"16314","There are multiple reasons why Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure is such an entertaining movie even now, but the biggest is that Matheson, Solomon, and director Stephen Herek found the perfect Bill and Ted in Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves, two young actors with just the right boyish energy.","83","96928"
"16315","Lee, as he did in ''Malcolm X'' and ''Clockers,'' makes his hero's dread palpable, and though 25th Hour lacks the glittering brilliance of those films, I was held by the toughness and pity of Lee's gaze.","83","307901"
"16316","The flourishes don't answer the question most on Potterites' minds -- who lives, who dies? -- but they briefly stupefy.","83","373889"
"16317","From a distance The Spectacular Now is mere soap opera, but it is one of those films that grow more fascinating upon inspection.","83","1714206"
"16318","What's bleakly hilarious about the whole movie is that Bekmambetov directs the nonaction scenes just as hyperbolically.","83","493464"
"16319","There's a Gordon Gekko vibe to Shannon's reptilian, charismatic villain. Like Oliver Stone's ""Wall Street,"" 99 Homes understands that people don't sell their souls because they're inherently evil — they do it because being rich is cool.","83","2891174"
"16320","Hannibal lacks the rounded emotional elegance of ''The Silence of the Lambs'' (that was a great film; this one is merely good).","83","212985"
"16321","The middle school dialect takes a backseat to the ingenuity on hand. It’s quite clear that the masterminds behind Sausage Party really thought this one out, examining this world long enough to have the most fun in it.","83","1700841"
"16322","A grandly entertaining historical drama.","83","824758"
"16323","Berg doesn't let up on the tension, even when the action is bloodless.","83","431197"
"16324","Though it occasionally dips too deep into a well of redneck humor, Slither cleverly exploits the nervous laughter that fills a theater whenever a horror movie gets too frightening to bear.","83","439815"
"16325","Unlike its obvious influence, the 1999 Japanese shocker ""Audition,"" The Human Centipede has no real-world echoes. It's an only-in-the-movies sick goof.","83","1467304"
"16326","Intimate, soul-baring, and winning, The End Of The Tour is a special, lovely little gem.","83","3416744"
"16327","A shimmering example of what Hollywood sci-fi can achieve when the aim is high, Annihilation is a gripping, mystifying adventure and proof that a transportive experience is more rewarding than a story with clean-cut resolutions.","83","2798920"
"16328","In its own superannuated preppy way, Stillman's comic universe is as singular as Woody Allen's.","83","1667307"
"16329","You know you're in the hands of a true filmmaker when you feel invited, at every turn, to share his sense of entrancement. I got that feeling in just about every frame of American Beauty.","83","169547"
"16330","Like Kubrick, Field doesn't make any moral judgments about his characters, and his film remains stubbornly enigmatic. It can be read as a high-class revenge thriller, an ode to the futility of vengeance or almost anything in between.","83","247425"
"16331","Biller explores female fantasy in the most diabolical of ways imaginable and gender politics are dissected with a brutal honesty that could infuriate some feminists with its observations.","83","3908142"
"16332","From laugh to laugh — and there are many — you might question the target of the jokes, but that’s often because The Disaster Artist rarely works on one level: There’s meta humor, self-referential gags, and human reverence paid to the earnest pursuit of a Hollywood dream. Such are the layered joys of this exuberant — if surprisingly conventional — buddy comedy about the making of the worst movie of all time.","83","3521126"
"16333","Jarhead isn't overtly political, yet by evoking the almost surreal futility of men whose lust for victory through action is dashed, at every turn, by the tactics, terrain, and morality of the war they're in, it sets up a powerfully resonant echo of the one we're in today.","83","418763"
"16334","Richly frightening film.","83","258000"
"16335","Best approached with little to no advance information or expectations, which is the same way the film's characters experience their lives.","83","1334260"
"16336","While the storytelling grows frustratingly elliptical, Lelio so desperate to constrain the drama that he resorts to removing helpful pieces of it, the scenes that remain are succinct and evocative.","83","5639354"
"16337","The fairy-tale-like 3 Godfathers casts Wayne as one of a trio of outlaws charged with caring for a baby, and discovering responsibility and perhaps his soul (the two go hand-in-hand for Ford) in the process.","83","40064"
"16338","Flat-out one of the more exciting and original gut-busters that Hollywood has produced in many a month. It's virtually all action, but the action is never mindless and it is full of marvelous surprises every step of the way.","83","443274"
"16339","Cianfrance is the real deal, and anyone who can persuade talented Hollywood stars to enact nonironic, intelligent, ambitious drama should be encouraged, especially when the result is something like this.","83","1817273"
"16340","Flawed though it may be, it's frequently an unaffected pleasure, in no small part because of Depp but also because of a raffish air that's a welcome respite from the heavy going of ""The Matrix Reloaded,"" ""The Hulk"" and other behemoths.","83","325980"
"16341","Rises above the over-tired gross-out comedy genre partly because of its meta celebrities-parodying-themselves trick, but it mostly stands out because it's genuinely funny.","83","1245492"
"16342","Gross-outs and gotchas are fun, but they wouldn’t amount to much if Covenant wasn’t so thoroughly well-crafted.","83","2316204"
"16343","It’s an offbeat, fun, and frequently very funny film, lifted out of disposability by some wonderfully rich production design, music cuts and photography, and by the cherishable performances of the leads.","83","1714915"
"16344","It’s a minor-key tale by any measure: a May-December romance played out in the fading shadow of Old Hollywood glamour. But it also has the benefit of a thoughtful script, sensitive direction, and leads gifted enough to breathe fresh air into nearly every moment.","83","5711148"
"16345","As epic, grandiose, and emotionally appealing as the previous pictures, The Hobbit doesn't stray far from the mold, but it's a thrilling ride that's one of the most enjoyable, exciting and engaging tentpoles of the year.","83","903624"
"16346","It’s the stirring chemistry between Joaquin Phoenix and John C. Reilly as committed siblings that transforms these lively, violent circumstances into a sweet and intimate journey designed to catch acolytes of the genre off-guard.","83","4971344"
"16347","Cloud Atlas is certainly out to be a ''visionary'' mindbender, but the film's secret is that it's a nimbly entertaining and light-on-its-feet Hollywood contraption, with the actors cast in multiple roles as if playing a game of dress-up.","83","1371111"
"16348","Honey Boy may center on the impressive portrayals of three talented actors, but it’s the woman behind the camera that makes it soar. You simply can’t wait to see what she does next.","83","8151874"
"16349","While We're Young is a clear-eyed satire of intergenerational tension that derives much of its comedy from a series of moments in which its mid-forties couple attempt to mesh with a younger crowder.","83","1791682"
"16350","This film is a goddamned blast. To merely call it the strongest entrant in the DC Entertainment Universe so far is to call Jaws the strongest entrant in the shark movie canon. Say what you will about Clark Kent, Bruce Wayne, and Deep Blue Sea, but Wonder Woman is in another class altogether.","83","451279"
"16351","The only scenes that felt ""actorly"" come when the pair drunkenly crash an ex-girlfriend's wedding party. Otherwise, The Messenger has a verisimilitude rare in films tackling this subject matter.","83","790712"
"16352","Suburbia has the attitude and exploitation kicks of other films about youth rebellion, including more than a few Cormans, but Spheeris’ fidelity to the real L.A. scene—including performances by non-actors and musicians like Flea, who appears with a pet rat—compensates for some contrivances in the writing.","83","86589"
"16353","There are a couple hiccups that prevent the movie from elevating to the classic status of your Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fictions.","83","3460252"
"16354","This impressive film feels more like a display, if an often dazzling one, than a genuine experience.","83","765429"
"16355","Like the creatures in the films, and many of Cronenberg's other films themselves, Shivers is disturbing on an almost biological level.","83","73705"
"16356","It's the rest of the movie, especially a grin-inducing final third, which makes ""Apes"" rise above the level of a typical sci-fi rehash.","83","1318514"
"16357","A subliminal commentary on the science of human behavior through a supernatural lens, “Overlord” manages to satisfy expectations of pure escapism even as it digs deeper, and it’s a welcome alternative to so many movies that don’t even try.","83","4530422"
"16358","It's hard to explain exactly why Clint Eastwood's Letters From Iwo Jima is so much better than its companion World War II film ""Flags Of Our Fathers,"" except to say that Flags tries too hard to emphasize the ironies of selling a war, while Letters deals with the ins and outs of the war itself.","83","498380"
"16359","Shadow brings heart and spectacle together, and the result is a bombastic martial arts wuxia replete with duels of breath-taking beauty that will please longtime Zhang acolytes and newbies alike.","83","6864046"

"16361","While at times too over-the-top and operatic for its own good, those same flawed ingredients echo the rough edges that define the movie's iconic subject.","83","2080374"
"16362","For Michael Keaton, Birdman is some kind of gift from the movie gods, a license to have his cake and messily devour it too.","83","2562232"
"16363","They have been true to a classic source, using Adams' language and finding just the right actors, sets and costumes to flesh out his vision. Only the most persnickety cultist won't appreciate the effort.","83","371724"
"16364","Gripping action and vulnerable heroes writ large. It boldly goes somewhere different and makes it hard to leave the film not hoping for a return voyage soon.","83","796366"
"16365","Grounded in lively performances by Chris Pine and Ben Foster as a pair of bank-robbing brothers, with a capable assist from a no-nonsense Jeff Bridges as the sheriff on their tail, Hell or High Water tries nothing new but delivers a fun ride.","83","2582782"
"16366","For now, the franchise has enough zip and humor to be worthwhile.","83","1690953"
"16367","This movie, saddle sores and all, is a lot of fun.","83","409847"
"16368","The film never loses its strong sense of character, but those characters deserve a bit more love than they’re afforded. Still, Lynskey and Wood see it through.","83","5710514"
"16369","It's long, like life, but like life it continually fascinates.","83","421715"
"16370","Before it traps Ralston, 127 Hours gives us ample evidence of his energy, zest and boyish charm and wit.","83","1542344"
"16371","Brainy and exciting at the same time, Interstellar invalidates the need for mindless Hollywood product. No matter its shortcomings, the movie achieves an impressive balancing act. It turns the mysteries of the universe into a cinematic playground, but for every profound or visually arresting moment, it also encourages you to to think.","83","816692"
"16372","Built around Firth’s fine work, A Single Man is a handsome film that, like its slender source novel, is stylish, quiet and sure.","83","1315981"
"16373","The charm of The Meddler isn't the kind that benefits from big pushes forward in narrative or massive plot movements, but it revels in heart-warming humor, vibrant characters and what's clearly a deep affection for its story.","83","4501454"
"16374","Fair Game gets you riled up all over again at a deeply unpatriotic abuse of power.","83","977855"
"16375","It is almost preposterous how little ""plot"" there is in the film...What it has in spades is attitude, and right up until the moment the film began, I was afraid It was going to be so juvenile and filthy that I would end up annoyed by it. Instead, from the very beginning of the opening credits, it is clear that director Tim Miller and screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick have crafted something deeply silly that isn't remotely interested in playing by the conventional rules of what we've come to think of as ""the superhero genre.""","83","1431045"
"16376","The film's surface is made up of familiar '60s romantic-comedy elements, from Hepburn's haute wardrobe to the Henry Mancini score to the breezy interaction between the stars. They banter, bicker, and make up with witty repartee. It's what movie love is supposed to look like, which makes it all the more heartbreaking to know that it's destined to sour.","83","62407"
"16377","Raimi does everything extravagantly and swiftly in Darkman. Instead of deriving from a particular comic book, he seems to be creating one -- or creating a film series. Or a TV series. Or two of the three. [24 Aug. 1990, p.R11]","83","99365"
"16378","Enter The Void is a trance-like experience, feeding the shimmering neon of Tokyo at night into a spectacular hallucinogenic head-trip.","83","1191111"
"16379","The generosity and gorgeousness with which Aussie writer-director Stephan Elliott (and costume designers Lizzy Gardiner and Tim Chappel) turn this most unlikely road picture into something arresting - if a tad sentimental - in its naive vision of a perfectly tolerant world.","83","109045"
"16380","The film is a minor Christmas miracle: It succeeds on its own terms, despite the gossip hounds' best blood-sniffing efforts, and dares to be an entertainment rather than a statement.","83","985699"

"16385","10 Cloverfield Lane superbly shuffles what we know (and don't) and what the characters are experiencing.","83","1179933"
"16386","This is a film of tactile decadence, such a rich sensory experience that it's almost suffocating.","83","2554274"
"16387","A silly, stabby, supremely clever whodunnit that only really suffers from having too little room for each of its talented players to fully register in the film’s limited run time.","83","8946378"
"16388","A terrific movie about middle-age malaise and a comedy of unusual wit and drollness.","83","185014"
"16389","If you look at The Post next to something like All the President’s Men, you see the difference between having a story passively explained to you and actively helping to untangle it. That’s a small quibble with an urgent and impeccably acted film. But it’s also the difference between a very good movie and a great one.","83","6294822"

"16391","Kidman's Virginia Woolf is already controversial -- Yet there's something fierce, noble and deeply affecting in her work that mirrors Woolf's prose style, and her turbulent presence is the soul of the movie.","83","274558"
"16392","Writer-director Jeff Nichols re-teams with his ""Shotgun Stories"" star Michael Shannon for his second feature, Take Shelter, which has a similar setting, but a different mood. Nichols is still concerned with family legacies, and the ways people in smaller communities relate to each other, but Take Shelter is slower and smoother, deliberately developing a mood of creeping dread.","83","1675192"
"16393","The cast is a pitch-perfect assemblage of pretty young things, but James Van Der Beek, as a slit-eyed dorm stud, proves that he can be an actor of cruel force.","83","292644"
"16394","Waititi’s witty script and colorful supporting role as Adolf Hitler are the obvious comedic highlights of Jojo Rabbit. But the film only works because it manages to nail its balance of tones.","83","2584384"
"16395","U-Turn is an overdue event, a chance for Stone to apply his hypnotic acid-trip-of-the-soul wizardry to something sexy and lowdown.","83","120399"

"16397","Loose, limber and driven by a fierce energy and staccato/pause rhythm we haven't seen previously from this filmmaker, Noah Baumbach's sublime Frances Ha is a fresh and vivacious near-reinvention of the director/writer's comedic milieu.","83","2347569"
"16398","A smart, savvy and satisfying Hollywood comedy.","83","385267"
"16399","The filmmakers piece it together with almost clockwork perfection and deliver it with masterful misdirection, creating the most ingenious, eccentric and brazenly jaundiced psycho-thriller to come along in years.","83","387564"

"16403","The Fault in Our Stars wins points for being more complex and stylish than most similar films feel they need to be. Most movies with this target audience are maudlin and manipulative, but Boone's film never feels like it's trying too hard to win our tears—or our laughter.","83","2582846"
"16404","While its main characters are tough-minded, Rust and Bone is itself pure heart.","83","2053425"
"16405","In spite of the out-of-place pregnancy subplot, Smashed is a film of pummeling intensity and bruised emotions.","83","2063781"
"16406","It's a perfect summation of why he was the ultimate filmmaker.","83","975645"
"16407","Blockers doesn’t pull off the impossible so much as it turns the tables on a common formula, finding something fresh, empowering, and hilarious in that time-old story of a group of friends making a pact to lose their V-card on prom night.","83","2531344"
"16408","Despite the merry duo of Ford and Connery, The Last Crusade offered a familiar pursuit of the Holy Grail. The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull makes a better move: It goes back to the future. Once again, the Indiana Jones series is the rare franchise that treasures knowledge and embraces the unknown.","83","367882"

"16414","Among Gosling's many star-making qualities is his nuanced mastery, since ""The Believer,"" of a facial expression of infinitely adaptable, imperturbable, sustained calm that can read as chilling or ardent, hard or soft, as the role demands.","83","780504"
"16415","It was only with the advent of digital technology that the notion of an entire film done in a single take became possible. Mike Figgis got there first with ''Time Code,'' and now the Russian director Alexander Sokurov has brought off a comparably startling feat with Russian Ark.","83","318034"
"16416","This is familiar psychological as well as stylistic territory for Anderson after ""Rushmore"" and ""The Royal Tenenbaums."" But there's a startling new maturity in Darjeeling, a compassion for the larger world that busts the confines of the filmmaker's miniaturist instincts.","83","838221"
"16417","With him (Schwarzenegger), we return to a franchise we never knew we missed, surprisingly grateful for the star's generosity -- and evident pleasure -- in strapping on the old sunglasses and blasting adversaries to hell.","83","181852"
"16418","You never forget you're watching a derivative, machine-tooled entertainment; the fun is in how the machine keeps spinning off course.","83","108399"
"16419","And among the things this ''HP'' does very well indeed is deepen the darker, more frightening atmosphere for audiences of all ages already familiar with the intricacies of the ''Potter'' landscape. (This is as it should be: Harry's story is supposed to get darker.)","83","295297"
"16420","Equally a slick political thriller, intelligent period piece and sly Hollywood satire, Ben Affleck's Argo maintains a careful balance between commentary and entertainment value.","83","1024648"
"16421","A work of gentle, continual hilarity that feels far more ordinary than other Coen works and yet has every bit of the originality and exactness that makes the brothers' best films so wonderful.","83","138524"
"16422","With War for the Planet of the Apes, technological wizardry and first-rate storytelling combine into a bracing action-adventure that concludes the best science fiction trilogy since the original trio of “Star Wars” movies.","83","3450958"
"16423","Molly’s Game is a successful crime drama, but it’s also a film that acknowledges the presence of both good and bad luck in the pursuit of excellence. Most importantly, it allows failure to exist as a living and breathing entity, rather than a tragic ending or a fate simply suffered by the morally impure. And that is what you might call exceptional.","83","4209788"
"16424","Bridge of Spies is like Capra with a dash of le Carré.","83","3682448"
"16425","Before all else, Villneuve's grim chronicle of the fallout when two young girls vanish in a small town succeeds at crafting one powerfully suspenseful moment after another.","83","1392214"
"16426","A sensory and intellectual overload from start to finish, a brawny, brainy summer movie that may infuriate as many viewers as it enraptures.","83","1375666"
"16427","The title suggests a dramatic Shakespearean twist, but Clooney's aims are much simpler. As he builds to a western showdown divorced from political specificity, the Manchurian-like manipulation turns Ides of March into an allegorical monster movie in which everyone's competing for the role of the monster and most people can't see it.","83","1124035"
"16428","If nothing else, Gravity makes the case for throwing immense resources at true visionaries; the blockbuster craftsman as adventurer, Cuarón expertly blends the epic with the intimate. For every stunning 3-D setpiece involving a dangerous hailstorm of metallic debris, there’s a moment of small tenderness.","83","1454468"
"16429","A movie that taps directly back into the show's primal appeal, which is the sweet, sad, saucy delight of sharing these women's company.","83","1000774"
"16430","The beauty of Little Men — and of the director’s work in general — is that it displays a rare understanding of how the world works.","83","4919484"
"16431","An intensely exciting puzzle-gimmick thriller, the kind of movie that lets you know from the start that it's slyly aware of its own absurdity.","83","119174"
"16432","The Wachowski Brothers once again they prove themselves our reigning masters of murk.","83","434409"

"16438","""Money Never Sleeps"" doesn't get inside the sociopathology of the money culture. In a sense, it is a product, an expression, of that culture. Maybe that's why it's so disagreeably agreeable.","83","1027718"
"16439","Anthony Hopkins is a great actor and he gives a resourceful, inventive, compelling performance that holds our attention over three hours. It never convinces us that he is Nixon: he doesn't look much like him, and he misses entirely that incredible shiftiness in his public manner. But it somehow works. [20 Dec 1995, p.C1]","83","113987"
"16440","With so much going for it, it's sad that Red Eye goes into such a third-act tailspin and cliched slasher-flick finale.","83","421239"
"16441","Right away in Miami Vice you know you're waist-deep in movieland.","83","430357"
"16442","Isn't content to stick to the genre conventions it sets up. Instead, it sprawls and mutates into one of the Coens' elaborate gizmoid yarns.","83","243133"
"16443","This movie embraces everything that should make it lousy, calling out itself for aping the source's bad ideas then flipping the script with meta precision.","83","1232829"
"16444","As an sensory experience, 'WOWS' is mostly a terrifically visceral one, a full throttle fast and furious bacchanalia of drug-fueled madness. But as a scathing indictment of American rapacity, it isn't particularly deep or resonant beyond the exterior.","83","993846"
"16445","In his first role since turning 40, Cruise displays a likable new maturity, and an unexpected willingness to look weak and foolish.","83","325710"
"16446","Does a great job of being in two places at once: In the head and gangly bodies of kids, and in the hearts of those of us who have survived grades 6-8.","83","1196141"
"16447","In script and performance, the film is an articulate howl of anguish and rage given depth by a discerning comprehension of the ways various communities can rely on faith for very different means.","83","4196450"
"16448","Yes, Jackman’s impressive portrayal of Hart is at the center of “The Front Runner” (it’s one of the best performances of his career), but Reitman uses a large cast of characters to give depth to the events in question.","83","7074886"
"16449","It’s a gorgeous, visually ambitious film, full of show-offy setpieces reportedly inspired by the work of Hayao Miyazaki.","83","100477"
"16450","It's bloody brilliant.","83","365748"
"16451","Crazy Heart could use more rough edges, but while it’s a little too sentimental and tidy, Bridges’ humane, deeply empathetic lead performance makes it easy to root for one man’s redemption.","83","1263670"
"16452","While almost entirely family-friendly, the film deserves its PG rating: One plot point near the very end would have totally freaked my tender childhood sensibilities.","83","892769"
"16453","Under the Skin is a deliberately oblique piece of work that prizes rhythms and textures above hows and whys.","83","1441395"
"16454","This is remarkable stuff from a director on the cusp of the mainstream. You sense an American filmmaker might not have managed it.","83","1619029"
"16455","By the time Worf (Michael Dorn), knocking off a slimy attacker, growls a Schwarzeneggerish ''Assimilate this!'' we've already done so, with pleasure.","83","117731"
"16456","A funny, sad, scary and ultimately tragic coming-of-age drama/black comedy that skillfully -- and uncompromisingly -- creates its own world and uniquely pessimistic vision.","83","162346"
"16457","Landing closer to Coens country, Three Billboards is more of a slow-roasting tragicomedy about grief and culpability, with higher stakes, a lower gag count, and emphasis on the tragic. But McDonagh still lives for detours and digressions, for the opportunity to stall the plot and humorously slow play a conversation.","83","5027774"
"16458","The film does a lovely job of balancing emotional clarity, formal trickery, pop sweetness, and heartfelt narrative. It is, yes, cute, and it is, yes, quirky. And it is entirely justified, estimable and loveable in being those things.","83","1022603"
"16459","A punch in the stomach of a movie. It is as ugly as it is beautiful, as full of peaks as of lows. It's a character-driven movie about people on an emotional edge who are ridding themselves of the things that can no longer work without inflicting damage.","83","315733"
"16460","There's a certain elegant simplicity to the movie's execution that maintains a spirit of familiarity but also keeps the material afloat.","83","1967545"
"16461","Mostly very good. It's exactly the big fix of Saturday-matinee adventure, blazing special effects, inside humor and sly self-references for which its fans have been lusting.","83","121765"
"16462","Dark, funny, paranoid, arbitrary, humming with tamped-down eroticism and in love with all things weird: That's the good news.","83","120902"
"16463","By keeping the humor rooted in the performances and only letting sentimentality creep in when necessary, Nelson and Schwartz have crafted a film that feels refreshing, unique, and emotional.","83","4364194"
"16464","Win Win, it turns out, isn't a tale of facile victory. It's a movie about how loss makes everyone do things they'll both defend and regret.","83","1606392"
"16465","An energetically demented psycho-killer comedy set in faux-noir L.A., Seven Psychopaths rollicks along to the unique narrative beat and language stylings of Anglo-Irish writer-director Martin McDonagh (In Bruges), channeling Quentin Tarantino.","83","1931533"
"16466","As Hold the Dark sputters to an unsatisfying finale, Wright’s character promises to explain everything that came before. The movie’s great punchline is that he’ll never be able to sort it all out — and we’re right there with him, reeling from a disquieting saga that has no patience for anyone in need easy answers, but keen on leaving us gasping for breath.","83","5057140"
"16467","The problem is, the geek in question, at least as Jesse Eisenberg plays him, doesn't have the emotional expansiveness to fill out a movie. Perhaps sensing this, the filmmakers play out the story line from multiple points of view and crowd the stage with a pageant of voluble supporting characters.","83","1285016"
"16468","Bad Words does to spelling bees what “Bad Santa” did to Santa Claus.","83","2170299"
"16469","It's a nicely tart gulp of grown-up wit and cynicism -- with, for a change, a cherry on top.","83","171580"
"16470","In an era full of auteur-driven turbulence in Hollywood, The Sting stands out as a model of old-school craft, a richly appointed studio production with big stars and a premium on efficiency and pace.","83","70735"
"16471","Alec Baldwin is on camera for barely eight minutes in Glengarry Glen Ross, the tightly wound — and actually very fine — film adaptation of David Mamet’s play. But his big speech, whipping up the assembled real estate salesmen with reptilian gung ho, could stand as a compressed version of what makes Baldwin, when bad, so good.","83","104348"
"16472","While the movie risks smothering the heart of its drama in all the movement and noise, the sheer sensory overload often leads to astonishing bursts of emotional sophistication.","83","8652728"
"16473","While Margot's casual cruelty and the scenes of squirmy discomfort are sometimes painful to watch, the rendering of this disastrous family reunion is seriously, savagely droll.","83","757361"
"16474","It's a tiny story, told on an intimate scale, and it is rich in emotion, specificity and care.","83","1233334"
"16475","Mixing one of B horror’s lamest clichés (the failed priest-turned-cop character) with an innovative plot device (a long-missing chapter from the Bible), The Prophecy is an old-fashioned thriller with art-house pretensions.","83","114194"
"16476","It's a film for those people -- and they are legion -- who recoil in horror from the very notion of Christmas cheer. If you're in that crowd, and you know who you are, you'll love it.","83","307987"
"16477","They've made a movie-movie of Sweeney Todd, and if you've got the stomach and ear for it, you'll be grateful.","83","408236"
"16478","Perhaps the best thing about Naked City is that it does justice to that source material. At times, it rivals Weegee's best work in its harsh, unsentimental portrayal of New York as a city with a dark side the size of the Hudson River.","83","40636"
"16479","Creed II slavishly follows the sentimental-palooka Rocky template as if it were a sacred text. Still, it doesn’t make those old rope-a-dope tropes any less effective.","83","6343314"
"16480","It’s an introduction to adolescent viewers of some of life’s most painful events, even if those events aren’t always depicted in the most realistic ways. And therein lies My Girl’s effectiveness.","83","102492"
"16481","McAdams, whose comedic skills have gone unsung for way too long, is dizzy fun. The whole movie is, actually, even if it pretty much evaporates on impact — a kooky, vicarious loop of Mad Libs meets Cards Against Humanity, where whoever’s holding the popcorn last wins.","83","2704998"
"16482","Rhys-Meyers and Johansson work well together - they both know how to project glossiness and guile.","83","416320"
"16483","Wonderstruck lives in the glory of its filmmaking — its photography, its costuming, its set design, its brilliantly variegated Carter Burwell score.","83","5208216"
"16484","The movie is a great big feast of wreckage. But that’s also what makes it a bit numbing.","83","103064"
"16485","Artistically, however, the movie delivers on a surprisingly effective scale, no matter how Lonergan sees it. Alternately perceptive, subversive, tragic and profound.","83","466893"
"16486","Cynical and cheerily merciless.","83","427944"
"16487","Though it has a few elements of its construction that might be questionable, it's mostly a powerful, thoughtful, and visually striking picture.","83","3808342"
"16488","One of the most hilarious and engaging films from producer Judd Apatow's often inconsistent comedy factory, thanks to inspired dialogue, dynamite chemistry between Rogen and Franco and perfectly pitched stoner gags (undoubtedly the result of copious research).","83","910936"
"16489","The film is consistently fun, and Tucker's comeuppance ? will leave you gasping (if not gagging) with laughter.","83","1220628"
"16490","Think of this corrective to Kipling as ""The Longest Yard"" meets ""The Seven Samurai"" with cricket bats, choreographed dance numbers, romantic triangles and a rousing call to solidarity.","83","169102"
"16491","The most compelling question dangling at its end is, ""Didn't Steven Spielberg used to know how to bring a movie to an end?""","83","181689"
"16492","Heady, bold statements about humankind are both the film’s best aspect and its chief flaw: There are just so many of them.","83","1389072"
"16493","I couldn't help wishing that The Theory of Everything had more theory. Hawking famously excels at explaining complicated thoughts with layman simplicity, but the film never translates the originality and depth of his ideas — or even what they are.","83","2980516"
"16494","A darkly funny journey about life ticking by and the change to make wrongs right.","83","775529"
"16495","X2 sparkles with a lightness of spirit that was missing from ''X-Men.''","83","290334"
"16496","The film is an across-the-board charmer that should appeal to children as well as their parents, aficionados of animation and old-movie buffs who will be challenged to sort out the blur of seemingly hundreds of classic film references.","83","318155"
"16497","The easiest way for filmmakers to show injustice in the world is through the eyes of a child. In the case of Haifaa al-Mansour's movie, the injustice is Saudi Arabia's male-centric culture, and the child is a preteen girl named Wadjda.","83","2258858"
"16498","The film loses some of its grimy verisimilitude toward the end, but it’s nevertheless a surprisingly effective low-budget shocker with a sensibility as current as the latest viral videos, yet rooted in the suggestive, less-is-more atmospherics of Val Lewton.","83","1179904"
"16499","There’s a self-awareness to Shampoo that gives the movie a cleansing sadness and, oddly, makes Beatty an affectingly amoral roue.","83","73692"
"16500","Cruise is a man whose youthful cockiness has aged into self-assurance and cool confidence. It's a masterstroke of casting. The dynamism of Collateral, however, comes from Jamie Foxx.","83","369339"
"16501","An elegant adventure of a different kind.","83","373926"
"16502","There's nothing nice about 30 Minutes or Less. It's got no redeeming social value. It just ticks away, exploding all notions of where you think it's going to go. It blew me sideways.","83","1622547"
"16503","Writer-director Jordan Peele has smartly created a horror comedy that doesn’t feel like a series of sketches from his show: the whole thing is a single, coherent episode and individual scenes are masterfully and subtly crafted with tonal shifts that work well.","83","5052448"
"16504","Aster, it can’t be denied, possesses an almost supernatural command of dread. He knows how to hold a shot just long enough to create pinpricks of discomfort, to disorient with an abrupt cutaway, to drop stomachs with the godlike perch and glare of his camera.","83","8772262"
"16505","The true pleasures of Bound lie in the Wachowskis' inventive updated take on film noir traditions, sensuously realized by cinematographer Bill Pope (""Clueless"").","83","115736"
"16506","Banzai is an occasionally incomprehensible rush of subplots, sight gags, mythology, and bizarre fashion choices, truer to the spirit of classic adventure stories than to the letter. Which may be why people who love the film feel the way they do. Buckaroo Banzai assumes an attitude of poise and purpose in an otherwise awkward universe.","83","86856"
"16507","Part 1 of the final installment, 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,' is another scrupulous adaptation of J.K Rowling's books.","83","926084"
"16508","Jessica Chastain is a great actress, but with Miss Sloane, she also proves that she’s a great movie star.","83","4540710"
"16509","Fleck and Boden point out the absurd humor inherent in mental illness without trivializing its causes or consequences. This is not an easy trick, and it's largely thanks to Galifianakis' amalgam of wackiness and awkward sorrow that it works.","83","804497"
"16510","So jaunty, so limber, and so visually self-assured that art peeks through where crap has traditionally made its home.","83","134847"
"16511","Very good Leigh -- maybe even, given Manville's heroic work, great Leigh.","83","1431181"
"16512","It's a film with its own identity, the simple, thrilling story of a handsome god who falls to Earth and reminds everyone what heroes do.","83","800369"
"16513","Reitman lets the pop-culture references (oh hi, 4 Non Blondes' ""What's Up"") accessorize the story rather than guide it, and in its uncompromising treatment of a character who's troubled but also a stone-cold bitch, Young Adult offers compassion for rather than revenge on the ""psycho prom queen"" who has nothing left in life but a warped mix-tape from an ex who moved on long ago.","83","1625346"
"16514","The quest to be the best is a familiar film story, but if director-writer Chazelle has achieved anything here, it’s a deeply and richly different take on that journey—not only examining the cost of struggle but the reward of it, showing both what it takes to be great and what happens when you don’t have it.","83","2582802"
"16515","Heavy with horror though it may be, Foxtrot turns out to be too conceptually and stylistically audacious to be called a slog; it keeps throwing curveballs, some crueler than others.","83","6896536"
"16516","Even amongst its most wrenching scenes of unfettered anger and broken loyalty, a volatile sensuality nonetheless invades every frame of Paul Thomas Anderson's arresting The Master.","83","1560747"
"16517","It's a daring, even mildly challenging mixture for a superhero film, and while the pieces don't entirely add up, the puzzle is at least original.","83","448157"
"16518","All in all, Future II is another fantastic voyage in a thoroughly entertaining contraption.","83","96874"
"16519","The Debt is basically an entertaining riff on ""Munich."" It's about a (fictional) operation of top secret Israeli revenge, carried out by three highly trained agents whose plan goes off the rails in ways that are more fascinating than the mission itself.","83","1226753"
"16520","Ron Perlman returns as the film's loveable title character, a demon gone good who's tough on the outside but tender underneath, with a soft spot for kittens, candy, and babies.","83","411477"
"16521","Despite the echoes of Fellini, the result feels almost new in a way and given the immersive nature of Roma it doesn’t seem so radical to consider experiencing its cinematic beauty with a clunky headset on.","83","6155172"
"16522","It's Lonergan's masterfully subtle writing, littered with awkward exchanges that speak far louder than any cohesive monologue, that gives ""Manchester"" its humanity.","83","4034228"
"16523","Coppola and her production team — including The Grandmaster cinematographer Philippe Le Sourd — have created a fully realized world of eroticism, humidity, and Southern Gothic atmosphere. The characters are simply engulfed by it, almost to the point that even the twisted willow trees appear to be reaching out to grab them.","83","5592248"
"16524","It all becomes a sort of muddle for a while midway, one that’s not nearly as compelling as the acting itself, which is largely phenomenal, frequently surprising, and often more than a little bit heartbreaking.","83","1302006"
"16525","Has its heartbreaking moments and its surprise giggles, particularly thanks to Ron Hewat's minor role as a former hockey play-by-play announcer now narrating his nursing-home life.","83","491747"
"16526","Full of conviction, First Reformed feels like a lifetime of preoccupations and traumas distilled beautifully, accompanied with a haunting sparseness creating a profound deliverance.","83","6053438"
"16527","As willfully oblique as his first film was densely foreboding, a rumination on the perils and pleasures of interpersonal connection that would seem to refuse any easy connection with even the most curious of audiences.","83","2084989"
"16528","Beautifully shot by Amélie cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel, Inside Llewyn Davis is instantly recognizable as the work of its sibling auteurs. But it’s also something of a departure — looser and more rambling than the average Coen concoction, with a lovingly recreated period setting.","83","2042568"
"16529","Helms plays angelic insurance agent Tim Lippe with gentle nobility and hilarious naivete.","83","1477837"
"16530","Dazzles us with computer-generated animation that has never looked quite so boldly exotic or shimmeringly beautiful.","83","266543"
"16531","The movie’s lofty narrative ambitions never quite catch up with its aesthetics, but it’s still a fantastic beast of a film, intoxicating and strange.","83","4550098"
"16532","An absorbing, exciting costume drama that works as a historical romance, a family tragedy and a showcase for its young stars.","83","467200"
"16533","Sassy and sharp.","83","377092"
"16534","The movie, like the book, is a work of opportunistic gamesmanship, a luridly farfetched conspiracy thriller masquerading as an inquiry into the zeitgeist. You can't take Disclosure very seriously, yet the film has been made with cleverness and skill, and with a keen eye for the latest styles in corporate paranoia and ruthlessness.","83","109635"
"16535","The Babadook isn't a transcendent horror film. But its ability to handle and manipulate the conventional tropes apparent in so many of its peers makes it a satisfying ride.","83","2321549"
"16536","If all of Perry’s stories have been hard to stomach, Her Smell takes things to impressive new lows before hitting bottom and tunneling out through the other side. It’s truly one of the most noxious movies ever made, which might help to explain why it’s also Perry’s best.","83","7942742"
"16537","Balanced precariously between a horror film and a war movie, but it's so sly and assured that you can't dismiss the allegorical, even satirical undertones that Cortés teases out of Sparling's conceit.","83","1462758"
"16538","Never, for one second, is Vikander anything less than entirely truthful.","83","1441953"
"16539","The Old Man & the Gun eschews pastiche for a sweet, affable character study that resurrects Redford’s original star power with a wet kiss. The entire picture amounts to a low-key cinematic resurrection.","83","2837574"
"16540","It's the perfect material for Russell, who not only deals perceptively with the dizzying swings of manic depression, but makes it the fabric of a big, generous, happy-making ensemble comedy.","83","1045658"
"16541","One might argue that Coco could stand to be weirder and more self-indulgent; the alternate reality it creates is entertaining and expansive. But then it wouldn’t be a Pixar film. It is impeccable, time-tested craftsmanship, not experimentation, that drives Coco, both in its most familiar beats and in its most moving moments.","83","2380307"
"16542","Even in repetitive or undernourished moments Keaton, Offerman and Lynch always entertain. Their performances have fallen through the cracks of awards season.","83","4276820"
"16543","The plot unravels beautifully, at a pace that’s methodical but still anxiety-inducing, building up an air of psychological fear so impenetrable that the only relief from it is an occasional splattering of visceral horror or an even more rare quip along the way.","83","4062536"
"16544","It's a relentlessly downbeat, well-acted melodrama that's easy to admire, but intentionally impossible to enjoy.","83","831884"
"16545","It's a fine debut, far more grounded, plausible and engrossing than most Hollywood thrillers.","83","452623"
"16546","It demands people pay attention and look inward to find the private compass that will navigate us through murky sensibilities that are as capable of seducing us as they are Tom Ripley.","83","134119"
"16547","The result is a totally absorbing and entertaining film, one of the best historical dramas from Hollywood in many years.","83","870111"
"16548","Something of an unforgettable experience.","83","209958"
"16549","The first rock & roll kung fu videogame youth love story.","83","446029"
"16550","It melodramatizes everything and yet its overall effect is something more than melodrama.","83","929632"
"16551","The script finishes up exactly where you think it will, but along the way, there are enough surprises and perfectly delivered lines to make it a blast.","83","1981677"
"16552","It's no insult to the rest to say that this is one of those films that sells itself on the strength of a single performance.","83","1068649"
"16553","Perhaps the most thrilling thing about Looper is watching Johnson really grow leaps and bounds as a filmmaker.","83","1276104"
"16554","Inside Out is not just fun and breezy, it's also truly weird and wicked smart in its thoroughly heartfelt conclusions.","83","2096673"
"16555","The biggest problem with Lone Star is that colorful Charley Wade isn't the center of the movie -- it's bland Sam Deeds. Cooper isn't a compelling enough movie star to carry us along some of the film's more languid twists and turns.","83","116905"
"16556","Like Spielberg, even if the content is questionable or the performance is missing, his scenes always manage to be visually thrilling.","83","175880"
"16557","Played with black humor that never gets in the way of the horror, Natali’s film cleverly exploits Dren’s uncanny semi-humanity.","83","1017460"
"16558","Avoid the hype, just go enjoy the movie","83","120915"
"16559","I came away impressed at how Haggis made something original and real.","83","2343793"
"16560","The title refers to cheap fireworks that fizz before they flame out quietly, and that's what three Southwestern slackers do in this amiable heist movie-cum-road flick.","83","115734"
"16561","The movie never falls into gushy moments of inspiration and Schnabel never tries to manipulate any particular response from the audience. We're left to make of it what we will.","83","401383"
"16562","A painful, funny and fresh comedy.","83","449059"
"16563","Brutal but hugely entertaining.","83","68638"
"16564","It's impossible to praise too highly the verve, skill and authenticity with which Spielberg brings off his alien invasion.","83","407304"
"16565","Working with someone else's material and a story outside the mainstream of his (Lee) work, he delivers laughs, puzzles, tension and the immense gift of fine actors at their delicious, familiar best.","83","454848"
"16566","If the new Ocean's Eleven is mostly Clooney's show, he's more than up to the task of carrying it. Indeed, this could be his career-defining role: The twinkle in his eye has never seemed more disreputable, his devil-may-care charm has never seemed so appealing, and he dominates the movie with the graceful ease of a Golden Age Hollywood star.","83","240772"
"16567","Other than flubbing the dismount, Stick It is smarter and funnier than it has any right to be.","83","430634"
"16568","Mudbound soars thanks to the impressive performances of the ensemble cast and, notably, Rees’ intent on depicting the harsh reality of this pre-Civil Rights era, warts and all.","83","2396589"
"16569","An unusual and absorbing, if somewhat preachy film.","83","433383"
"16570","For kids, blessedly unironic by nature until wised up by nurture, the movie is just shiny, funny, and filled with songs.","83","1204342"
"16571","Woodley, through the delicate power of her acting, does something compelling: She shows you what a prickly, fearful, yet daring personality looks like when it's nestled deep within the kind of modest, bookish girl who shouldn't even like gym class.","83","1840309"
"16572","It's the first futuristic disaster movie that's as cute as a button. Which, when all the special effects blow over, is what we Americans like in a monster hit.","83","116629"
"16573","Wang’s story outline shares the familiar contours of other immigrant tales: the Babel tower of half-spoken languages; the ties that bind across oceans, and the physical and cultural gaps that can still break them. But Farewell also has the freshness of her own distinct voice, a dry humor and low-key melancholy that infuses even the most quotidian scenes.","83","8637428"
"16574","Asylum was written by Robert Bloch, the author of the original novel Psycho, and produced by the U.K.’s Amicus Productions, which was responsible for a series of horror anthologies during the ’60s and ’70s. Asylum remains, by far, their finest offering, in part because of its pitch-perfect gothic mood, and in part because its stories present varied perspectives on the depths of obsessive madness.","83","68230"
"16575","Craig makes you aware of something that the Bond series, in its pursuit of steamy sex and cartoon action, quickly lost sight of: 007 is a killer. That's what he's licensed to do.","83","381061"
"16576","Capharnaüm is not without its issues. The director over-relies on the courtroom scenes and the movie’s message is heavy-handed at times. Yet, the sheer force of the filmmaking and its artful delivery overpowers sappy overreaching.","83","8267604"
"16577","A large-scale military drama with a quiet, almost mournful center.","83","115956"
"16578","It’s a thrilling rollercoaster designed for the theatre made by one of the few working directors who truly knows how to make movies for a theatre.","83","455407"
"16579","American Graffiti is an unabashed nostalgia piece, but the poignancy of Lucas holding onto this memory only becomes clear at the end. For these boys, nothing would ever be the same again.","83","69704"
"16580","The lushness of its images, how they simultaneously recall and move forward, in concert with its confidence in its pacing, as a work of both writing and editing, are a powerful thing taken in-tandem.","83","1212428"
"16581","Silverman is completely riveting as she tries and flails to do right, and her physical performance is remarkable: a change in her gait or expression signals the switch in her personality from human to addict.","83","3640682"
"16582","A big-hearted French movie that shines with wit, beauty, humor, sunshine and the love of love.","83","211915"
"16583","Its concept is gutsy, its script is literate and intelligent, its visuals and cinematic craftsmanship are mouth-dropping, and its vision of the insanity of various religions vying to dominate the real estate of the Holy Land comes through with great power.","83","320661"
"16584","There’s a certain flat indie artlessness to “The Big Sick,” but it’d be shortsighted to discount how well-written and well-acted it is. This is a very funny movie, yet always plausibly so—never throwing in jokes just for the sake of a laugh.","83","5462602"
"16585","For all the ostensible immaturity of its form, Fantastic Mr. Fox is the most grown-up thing the director has done in years.","83","432283"
"16586","Both of its time and of the moment, Straight Outta Compton is potent and largely successful, and makes a hell of a case for why this was a story worth telling.","83","1398426"
"16587","Malick is a unique director of extraordinary gifts, of that there can be no doubt. If he ever chooses to shoot a script as fine as his technique, he will surely produce a masterpiece of the medium.","83","402399"
"16588","More sad than salacious, it’s the rare film about a criminal that offers human details without humanizing a man who so many agree was a monster.","83","2481498"
"16589","One of those should-I-laugh-or-cry satires.","83","1226774"
"16590","Long live Michael Myers, so maybe someone can finally kill him — in a big, funny, scary, squishy, super-meta sequel that brings it all back to the iconic 1978 original.","83","1502407"
"16591","The hit-and-run outlandishness of ""Clerks"" was a stunt. With Chasing Amy, Smith has made his first real movie.","83","118842"
"16592","The highlights of The Cooler -- the portrait of Bernie-as-schlub, the ecstatic union of two losers, the depiction of shadowy old Vegas confronted with its sanitized corporate future -- are superb. You can easily live with the rest to get to them.","83","318374"
"16593","Given the impossibility of crafting William Shakespeare into a believable human being, the film is an honorable try.","83","9206798"
"16594","As the jabbering psychotic Jeffrey Goines, Brad Pitt has a rabid, get-a-load-of-me deviousness that works for the film's central mystery: We can't tell where the fanatic leaves off and the put-on artist begins.","83","114746"
"16595","Sicario starts and ends with Blunt’s impassioned performance (and she's spectacular in her final scene), but it’s Del Toro who is the real standout.","83","3397884"
"16596","There’s still that dissonance — Pixar is creating its own world, though the characters, and replicating our own, in the gorgeous vistas — but even when the combination doesn’t truly sing, it remains entrancing, and even surprising.","83","1979388"
"16597","Fruitvale is largely sustained by Jordan's career-making performance and the way Coogler uses it to analyze his subject...It's a fascinating investigation into the contrast between media perception and intimate truths.","83","2334649"
"16598","Between the known metatext and Affleck’s bone-deep commitment, this moving central performance largely purges the film of its high potential for the maudlin.","83","8544498"
"16599","Far-fetched but deliciously exciting aerial nail-biter.","83","408790"
"16600","If you're sick of the gross-out gags and sex jokes of contemporary teen comedy, this defiant blast of idiosyncratic individuality just could be your tonic.","83","374900"
"16601","The emotional stakes are large-scale, and Farhadi honors them by delving into their intricacies.","83","2404461"
"16602","With his Mephisto-phelean swagger and chewy, good ol’ boy drawl, Reynolds is a chest-beating revelation.","83","68473"
"16603","The story and the songs, with a few notable if hardly unexpected updates, are fondly faithful to the original; the magic mostly intact. Another reboot was never terribly necessary, maybe — but it’s good, still, to be King.","83","6105098"
"16604","John Wick won't redefine action movies, but it perfectly exemplifies what I want from an action film when I go. Have fun with the world, shoot the action well, motivate it in a way that doesn't feel cheap.","83","2911666"
"16605","A great deal of Buster Scruggs might ultimately be a touch undercooked by the mercurial siblings’ standards, but dagnabbit if there isn’s a whole lot to like.","83","6412452"
"16606","There’s a kinetic energy in Levinson’s telling, and real catharsis in a riotous final sequence that feels all the more triumphant for the unlikeliness of such a bloody, happy ending.","83","6205872"
"16607","As a piece of poetic compression, it ranks with the opening of Orson Welles's ""The Magnificent Ambersons.""","83","1049413"
"16608","It serves as testimony to the ghosts that continue to haunt such men as ex-senator Bob Kerrey.","83","91886"
"16609","If you were presenting a case for Newman’s legacy of acting brilliance, this film would be exhibit A.","83","84855"
"16610","Warm, soulful, funny and quietly insightful, Boyhood shines in its engrossing, experiential understanding and it’s a special achievement that should be cherished and acknowledged.","83","1065073"
"16611","The coat of irony helps when the film takes a major pivot in tone, and Stevens is unnervingly placid as the corn-fed terminator.","83","2980592"
"16612","As with Snowpiercer, this is a story almost too eager to fire in multiple directions, sometimes with messy results, veering from broad satire to softer exchanges with little regard for finding balance between the two.","83","3967856"
"16613","Velvet Goldmine is no masterpiece, but, at its best, it's a ravishing rock dream.","83","120879"
"16614","Story comes second to Russell over the rhythms of well-timed bickering, which is a blessing and a curse in American Hustle.","83","1800241"
"16615","Lost In America is equally potent as a satire of the road movie and of the American dream of endless mobility and escape.","83","89504"
"16616","Arrival has come, like a visitor from the cosmos, to blow minds and break hearts.","83","2543164"
"16617","Keep your ears tuned for Helen Mirren as the imperious Dean Hardscrabble. Hogwarts would have loved her.","83","1453405"
"16618","Ocean’s 8 is the self-aware frosé of movies; a summer delight, perfectly airy and refreshing, it’s not here to be your cinematic think piece. Ocean’s 8 knows exactly what it’s doing and what it’s trying to achive– showing the audience hell of a good time – and it succeeds marvelously at it, without leaving the audience feeling duped.","83","5164214"
"16619","The real halo here belongs to McConaughey. He does justice to Ron’s story and to his own quicksilver talent.","83","790636"
"16620","Paul Giamatti, dialing down his trembly-voiced neurotic energy to good effect, gives a holy hell of a performance as Barney Panofsky.","83","1423894"
"16621","The script contains some genuinely uproarious laughs and is sharper than it needs to be, even if some of the jokes feel as old as Bridget’s condoms.","83","1473832"
"16622","Starts out as mind-bending futuristic satire and then turns relentless -- it becomes a violent, postpunk version of an Indiana Jones cliff-hanger.","83","100802"
"16623","There are laughs and moments of pain and many instances of embarrassing (and deeply human) behavior throughout, but there's also delicacy and grace.","83","878835"
"16624","To say Blanchett is good here is a grave understatement.","83","3859076"
"16625","It ranks high on the Cronenberg scale as one of his more disturbing forays into depravity.","83","399146"
"16626","In an age when most cartoon companies have traded pens for pixels, the magicians at Laika continue to create fantastically elaborate universes out of pure elbow grease.","83","787474"
"16627","The characters are so well drawn (and the relatively young cast steps up to the plate) that combined with the material’s natural tension you’ll find yourself riveted to the proceedings.","83","3841424"
"16628","In a real sort of way, Gilliam IS Parnassus, carrying his tatterdemalion show forward from year to year and trying to get people to pay attention, and the mingled sense of bitterness and hope in his story makes this whole crazed fantasy into something far more real.","83","1054606"
"16629","Redgrave shimmers like one of Tuscany's magnificent cypress trees as an Englishwoman searching for Lorenzo (Nero).","83","892318"
"16630","People expecting plenty of Laurel & Hardy style laughs will be disappointed, obviously, given the movie’s comedy-lions-in-winter theme. But this thoughtful portrait of a long-lasting professional marriage rings touchingly true.","83","3385524"
"16631","The film's MVPs are Bryan Cranston's dedicated performance as the title character, and, appropriately, John McNamara's jocular screenplay, with a terrific ensemble of supporters also along for the ride back to Hollywood's notorious past","83","3203606"
"16632","This is sharp blockbuster filmmaking, coming at a time when IP is seemingly the only thing that gets any door open in Hollywood these days. Rather than churn out something cynical or pandering, though, Flanagan has instead taken that IP and instilled it with heart. Not just the chummy heart he’s hallmarked in past efforts, but the kind that comes from a creator who’s offered a chance to truly honor his influences and run with them.","83","5606664"
"16633","The star, though, is the script, a rare enough occurrence in Hollywood that it merits special note.","83","186151"
"16634","Allen's filmmaking technique isn't what it once was, true. But at age 75 he still manages to keep a spry pace going even if something less than impeccable craft hobbles the photography and editing.","83","1605783"
"16635","Slickly paced and carried by mature performances, Flight embodies one of the finer strains of Hollywood filmmaking in recent years.","83","1907668"
"16636","It is almost impossible, however, to watch Other Side Of The Wind without taking its history into account. That makes the final product uniquely captivating.","83","69049"
"16637","Baumbach’s sharp examinations of the limitations of the callow arrogance of youth and the fatuous nature of egocentricity are pointed and riotously enjoyable.","83","2872462"
"16638","For a movie so sensuously mounted, it's remarkably grounded.","83","810784"
"16639","Co-directors Nat Faxon and Jim Rash, who won an Oscar for writing ""The Descendants,"" are smart enough to mostly stay out the way and let this talented crew bring their script to life.","83","1727388"
"16640","While the premise of the film is outlandish, the feelings are all real...Director Vogt-Roberts and screenwriter Chris Galletta are in perfect unison on this film, harmonizing to create what feels like a fresh comic voice.","83","2179116"
"16641","The concept of the car chase suffered in limbo for too long with inexperienced directors too often cutting corners instead of respecting why films like “The French Connection,” “Bullitt” and “Ronin” are still held in high regard today. Like all great students, Wright tips his hat to the teachers and refuses to phone in the camerawork on his stunts.","83","3890160"
"16642","Virtually free from quirk and black humor, the film is an effective, nasty thriller and a rare horror film that provides an emotional investment because the portrait of teenhood is utterly authentic.","83","5112578"
"16643","While it's essentially just another slick Spielberg action machine, it's operating effectively on all cylinders throughout.","83","983193"
"16644","The movie is sensationally exciting, but its hey-kids-let s-put-on-a-war! story line plays like Beverly Hills, 90210 recast as a military-recruitment film for the Third Reich.","83","120201"
"16645","Ferrara, a visual expressionist at heart, creates some really unsettling moments, though maybe the most impressive thing about the movie is that it manages to make what’s basically a happy ending seem soul-crushingly bleak.","83","106452"
"16646","The most striking thing about it is what it's not...a richly atmospheric film that races surefootedly through complexities of data and emotion like a spy movie and not at all like a sentimental sob story.","83","829459"

"16650","Fans of Get Out, Peele’s brilliant, mind-bending 2017 debut, may feel vaguely let down that his follow-up is, for all of its sly humor and high style, a fairly straightforward genre piece, and that its bigger ideas and metaphors don’t feel quite fully baked.","83","6857112"

"16660","As a filmmaker, Eastwood may not be famed for subtlety, but he does have a way with economy. And he delivers Jewell’s story with almost no unnecessary flourishes; a taut, streamlined drama leavened by crucial doses of empathy.","83","3513548"

"16664","The Nice Guys spends nearly two hours treating Crowe and Gosling like a pair of piñatas, beating them mercilessly and unapologetically, and it’s watching them crawl out from underneath and towards some form of redemption that makes the film a genuine smash.","83","3799694"

"16669","A fine and sturdy picture, capable of standing alongside the many such films made when Westerns were one of our chief entertainments.","83","381849"
"16670","A great many filmmakers — too many — use handheld cameras to evoke a sensation of raw, this is really happening immediacy. But director Paul Greengrass is unique. At a glance, his live-wire, ragged-camera method may seem overly familiar, but the way he employs it, that method is as expressive as the style of a superb novelist.","83","1535109"

"16677","With Grisham's high profile and higher paychecks, his novels-turned-movies always will be on trial by critics and readers. The only thing The Client is guilty of is being suspenseful, funny and worth an extra trip to the theater this summer. [20 July 1994, p.6B]","83","109446"
"16678","You don't often hear critics gripe that a movie isn't long or explicit enough, but Sorkin and Nichols could have gone the extra lap or so to show that Wilson's saga is more than just a story of a good ol' boy accidentally pulling off a remarkable coup; it's a sobering account of the geopolitical hijinks that gave shape to our current world.","83","472062"

"16698","A funny, boozy, ramshackle party.","83","829482"
"16699","Doing some of his best work in years, Ewan McGregor plays Mills' alter ego as a prickly, not altogether noble loner in his late 30s who initially doesn't take the news of his father's coming-out well.","83","1532503"
"16700","Too goofy-surreal to pack a lot of emotional punch, but it's antically light on its feet, with 3-D images that have a lustrous, gizmo-mad sci-fi clarity.","83","1001526"
"16701","While there is an untruth at the heart of the film, it's in service of illuminating any number of smaller truths, and I find that approach fascinating.","83","790770"
"16702","Despite its ludicrous turns, the movie benefits from the far-fetched events for its sheer willingness to go there, not unlike Smith's goofy, self-deprecating public persona.","83","3099498"
"16703","Creepy implications keep Super 8 engaging, but the cast makes it click.","83","1650062"
"16704","Saving Mr. Banks is a wholesomely square film about a wholesomely square film. But damned if its sugar doesn't go down like honey.","83","2140373"
"16705","As was also true of Pixar's last movie, ""Cars,"" Ratatouille is better at pleasing the eye than the other senses.","83","382932"
"16706","Black Panther is different. It’s the first one of these films that flows with a genuine sense of culture and identity, memory and musicality. It’s the first one of these films that doesn’t merely reckon with power and subjugation in the abstract, but also gives those ideas actual weight by grafting them onto specific bodies and confronting the historical ways in which they’ve shaped our universe.","83","1825683"
"16707","Daniels gives a career-best performance.","83","367089"
"16708","It is historically evocative, visually transporting and an exuberant romantic comedy that adheres to its source while spinning its own artful energy.","83","414387"

"16711","Lanthimos presents a fully formed original vision that hits a perfect tone even when the narrative begins to get away from him a bit.","83","3464902"
"16712","This is the sort of incendiary role a lot of actors would kill for, yet the shock of Norton's performance isn't its showboat flamboyance. It's that he makes this sadistic junior sociopath rueful and intelligent.","83","120586"
"16713","The performances are razor sharp. And the ideas in this movie are, no kidding, big.","83","1058017"
"16714","What elevates Hustlers from an entertaining con job flick to something noteworthy is that the racket isn’t inherent to the story Scafaria wants to tell. Many filmmakers will say their film tackles female empowerment, but few do the legwork to make an integral and authentic part of the story.","83","5503686"
"16715","The best thing about Revolutionary Road, a cool-blooded and disquieting adaptation of Richard Yates' 1961 novel about a powerfully unhappy Connecticut couple, is that it doesn't end with that rote vision of bourgeois anomie. It only begins there.","83","959337"
"16716","The movie largely delivers, splashing its ambitious three-hour narrative across a sprawling canvas of characters, eras, and not-quite-insurmountable challenges.","83","4154796"
"16717","The movie captures a moment when the lines separating anonymity, fame, and notoriety are finer than ever. And as Watson’s social climber prattles on to reporters about what a great “learning lesson” her criminal experience has been, it’s easy to see another star in the making.","83","2132285"
"16718","It's a justifiably G-rated film, but parents may have some 'splainin' to do.","83","910970"
"16719","Battle of the Smithsonian has plenty of life. But it's Adams who gives it zing.","83","1078912"
"16720","The animation is consistently sporty and there are some choice comic riffs on martial arts movies.","83","441773"
"16721","A mostly fascinating, often frustrating, boldly uncommercial Hollywood version of a boldly uncommercial art film. It's very atypical of the previous work of both director and star, and it's as personal a film, I suspect, as Cruise will ever make.","83","259711"
"16722","It’s easy to get swept up in Booksmart‘s pace and pleasures, but take a breath and you might find yourself longing for a world that’s at least a touch more familiar.","83","1489887"
"16723","A movie seemingly custom-made for the era of alternative facts, American Animals feels like a new kind of true-crime thriller: one that shamelessly rewrites its truths in real time as it goes.","83","6212478"
"16724","Sheen is startlingly good here, and so is Timothy Spall as Clough's trusted and much abused lieutenant.","83","1226271"
"16725","One of the more original horror creations of the last few decades.","83","103919"
"16726","I Think We’re Alone Now is compelling from start to finish, yet somehow not entirely satisfying. Not because there’s anything wrong with it, simply because I wish there was more.","83","6169694"

"16728","While derivative and endlessly cheesy, it’s a characteristically visceral return for Gibson, and one that confirms that little has changed in the man’s singular artistic psyche.","83","2119532"
"16729","On film, Into the Woods feels tighter, the tone more cohesive.","83","2180411"
"16730","Not least among Khan's pleasures is the way it continually veers toward, but never quite crosses, the neutral zone between space opera and interstellar camp. By the end, it becomes simply operatic, with a death scene of surprising emotional power.","83","84726"
"16731","Nothing more and nothing less than a savvy and talented cast having its way with a clever, hilarious script, with absolutely no weighty issues at stake.","83","887883"
"16732","The more that Goddard upends our assumptions about who’s good, who’s bad, and who’s going to live through the night, the more we realize that we’re rooting for all of these fucked-up people to get right with the world. It’s massively didactic, but in a way that encourages us to dwell on how we feel about these characters, and how malleable those feelings are.","83","6628394"
"16733","A thematically rich and acutely moving update for both a new generation and certainly many more to follow.","83","3281548"
"16734","Moves like a bullet and, even if they're overblown, the action sequences are still mostly exhilarating and hypnotic. Moreover, the film's human dimension and character development is richer and more rewarding than the genre requires, and its philosophical underpinning more intellectually audacious and seductive: The film is more of a mind-trip than I expected.","83","234215"
"16735","Earnest, smart, handsome, well-acted and made with mastery.","83","140352"
"16736","Helgeland works in what I think of as a conservative — or maybe it's just really, really basic — neoclassical Hollywood style, spelling everything out, letting the story unfold in a plainspoken and deliberate fashion, with a big, wide, open pictorial camera eye. It's like the latter-day Clint Eastwood style, applied to material that's as traditional as can be.","83","453562"
"16737","Fan-ready and saga-solid.","83","1259571"
"16738","There is a genuinely epic quality to Unbroken, cribbed from masters and capably traced. That's really all this inspiring story needs.","83","1809398"
"16739","Best of all, a revisit with Jedi makes a viewer appreciate spectacle, presentation, mythology -- that, and the power of a bitchin' helmet to speak volumes in a language even an alien can understand. [Special Edition]","83","86190"
"16740","Girls Trip nails laugh after laugh even amidst — and oftentimes because of — dramatic issues that wouldn’t be out of place in a Lifetime movie.","83","3564472"
"16741","The story, at heart, is earnest and humorless teen romantic glop, but its feelings aren't fake, and the movie is compulsively watchable; it has a passionflower intensity.","83","1325004"
"16742","It's a sharp and vivid film, filled with moments of tremendous ingenuity and characterized by a persistent avoidance of the expected tropes. It's far scarier than the big-budget remakes of ""Godzilla"" and ""King Kong,"" more engaging than ""I Am Legend,"" more human than a sackful of slasher films.","83","1060277"
"16743","Fortunately, the filmmaker’s rare gift for brutal absurdity remains intact, and The Killing of a Sacred Deer only gets funnier as it grows darker.","83","5715874"
"16744","It works because Timberlake and Kunis are totally in control of their damaged characters without winking at the audience, as if to say: ""Aren't we cute, behaving so naughty?"" Their sex is amusingly awkward, and their repressed longings more so. It's the kind of chemistry that comes along once in a generation.","83","1632708"
"16745","Damon's how-to-break-the-law lesson - as ludicrous as anything else in this enjoyably zigzaggy exercise in accumulating peril - grants Neeson the fun of experimenting with an American ex-con accent for his one scene.","83","1458175"
"16746","This is a slight movie, but it's Williams' all the way (possibly to an Oscar nod) while the rest of the cast supports her well.","83","1655420"
"16747","The Road walks a tremendously daring and delicate line between inspiration and horror, and it does so not only in the events it depicts but in its very air and atmosphere. It was unforgettable on the page, and it impresses equally, or at least it does so remarkably often, on screen.","83","898367"
"16748","The Lighthouse is more satisfying when viewed through the prism of its pitch-black humor; it’s fine as a thriller, borderline brilliant as a comedy of cabin fever and competitive machismo.","83","7984734"
"16749","If you have a fondness for the genre and a particular love of '60s pop, The Man From UNCLE is the summer's big fizzy drink, all bubbles, and while it may be gone the moment you walk out of the theater, the smile it puts on your face will likely linger.","83","1638355"
"16750","Somberly fantastic new mystery thriller.","83","217869"
"16751","A winning movie about losing. I didn’t always warm to its coy quirkiness, but it’s the rare American movie about contemporary teenagers that rings more true than false.","83","2582496"
"16752","The first hour of The Last of the Mohicans plays like a convoluted history lesson. I appreciate that Mann has enough respect for the audience's intelligence to sketch in this briar patch of conflicting loyalties. But he outlines the interlocking factions without really making it clear, in dramatic terms, what each one stands for.","83","104691"
"16753","Both fascinatingly theatrical and thrillingly cinematic, a picture that's lingered on our minds more than we expected.","83","1781769"
"16754","The restraint of both director and actor makes this steely gangster drama reverberate long after it ends. This kind of mystery is rare in a film culture that demands answers before the credits roll.","83","765443"
"16755","It's reminiscent of David Lynch, who is a master at mixing the ghastly and the risible. Brick would be better with a bit more Lynch in its soul, but Johnson is his own man, and I look forward to what he comes up with next.","83","393109"
"16756","A fresh look at the first chapters in the monarch's life, while maintaining historical fidelity.","83","962736"
"16757","The result is relentless and involving even when it stumbles. Jolie may not be a full-fledged auteur yet, but she unquestionably possesses a singular aesthetic that courses through her work and exists completely apart from her high-profile acting career.","83","4882376"
"16758","The music, art direction and camerawork blend together with an integrity and scope that's wonderfully exhilarating. Every frame seems to communicate the grandeur, power and fatal pull of the sea.","83","311113"
"16759","Tightly scripted and intricately plotted, the buddy film manages the neat two-step of being simultaneously profane and engaging.","83","780536"
"16760","Wheatley’s commitment to crowdpleasing antics makes it difficult to stop and consider the lack of depth. In a universe of shootout clichés, Free Fire manages to carve out its own niche, where the proverbial last man standing matters less than the journey to get him there.","83","4158096"
"16761","Sheridan pares his story and characters down to their barest essentials, making a movie that comes off sometimes as slight, but which ultimately delivers the goods for those who like smart takes on life-or-death macho adventure.","83","5362988"
"16762","City Hall doesn’t just deserve an audience; it deserves a conversation. Even as Wiseman celebrates the sophistication of American ideals in practice, his movie illustrates just how hard they are to grasp.","83","12094720"
"16763","The most exhilaratingly horrifying movie to come out in years.","83","435625"
"16764","Chandor crafts a film in that contemplated vein of consequences, with a moral consideration for everything at stake, including the very souls of these soldiers, No one comes out clean.","83","1488606"
"16765","Director Bennett Miller has produced a warm and generally agreeable character study about the pratfalls of athletic institutions and the willingness to think outside the box.","83","1210166"
"16766","Liman stages the chaotic action scenes, including several iterations of the beach assault, with clarity, precision, and wit. This is his best movie since 2002's ""The Bourne Identity.""","83","1631867"
"16767","As a purely sensory experience at the movies you're hard-pressed to find anything more dazzling than the first 90 minutes of The Great Gatsby, when Luhrmann's riotous amusements make anything possible.","83","1343092"
"16768","Among all the chess-piece players on the board, the star is the only one who really builds a solid emotional foundation for his character.","83","945513"
"16769","The greatest miracle of Eighth Grade is its warmth. The film reflects arguably the worst stretch of growing up in America’s education system, but it’s rarely if ever ugly. Instead, it’s compassionate, radiating retroactive kindness for the children we all were to soothe the adults we are now.","84","7014006"
"16770","Combining a seething physicality with enough weary nobility and tightly checked rage for a dozen wronged heroes, (Crowe) provides the movie's vital center of gravity without looming over his co-stars.","84","172495"
"16771","It’s the little, almost imperceptible twists to the story that make Blockers a worthy entry into the teen sex comedy canon, most notably that girls and women are funny and can play more than the killjoy or the babe.","84","2531344"
"16772","What cinematographer Joshua James Richards can do with a camera bears the weight of countless filmmakers in thrall to the pregnant possibility of this marvelous continent. Every frame of this film speaks of innumerable lives—passions and failures and tragedies and triumphs—unfolding unfathomably.","84","6217608"
"16773","Rarely a moment is ever wasted, a consequence ignored, and though the climax is a corker, the final shot is even better. Prisoners requires and rewards your attention in equal measure. Be ready.","84","1392214"
"16774","The discussion of what the film isn’t is a discussion worth having, just not at the expense of what the film is: Delicious, sensual, made with sterling craft and an unassumingly sharp edge.","84","5592248"
"16775","The Old Man & the Gun is a fitting swan song to screen legend Robert Redford.","84","2837574"
"16776","Inside Out may be the best Pixar has released in a while, especially after a string of disappointing and underwhelming efforts, but what’s most cheering about the film—and most like Pixar’s celebrated classics—is that it’s so emotionally astute.","84","2096673"
"16777","In its barbs and visuals, indie vibe and old-school ambition, inside jabs and outsider artistry, it feels both of its time — when Welles’ cachet straddled an old guard who shunned him and young rebels who worshipped him — and like an acidly spit anecdote about artistic humiliation that still feels relevant.","84","69049"
"16778","Peele directs Us with a masterful collection of horror-movie tricks — jump scares that actually pay off, a cat-and-mouse game in an isolated place filled with bright lights and deep pools of impenetrable shadow, a throat-closing Michael Abels score full of intense drumming and choral chanting that elevates the action to operatic levels of drama. But his greatest asset is the performances, which turn an already creepy premise into something endlessly inhuman and unnerving.","84","6857112"
"16779","It's a cynical look not just at society and its structures and strictures, but at love itself. But it's still mesmerizing in its oddity, and it's exceptionally daring.","84","3464902"
"16780","Endgame was never designed to stand on its own as a single well-crafted movie, and it was never designed to follow the MCU formula. It was designed to cap a decade of buildup around a single gigantic story.... In that sense, it’s certainly a triumph: it’s ambitious, towering, and above all, daring in its difference.","84","4154796"
"16781","This hugely entertaining movie is about the wisdom and - with trenchant wit and sympathy - the human flaws in one of America's most idealized heads of state.","85","1477855"
"16782","There’s something almost inevitable about these real-life characters getting a feature showcase, so unusual, engaging and inspiring is their journey from antagonism to deep friendship.","85","6966692"
"16783","Scott whips it all into shape: the tense action involving the kidnappers, the investigation’s twists, the maddening campaign to give Getty a financial incentive in freeing his grandson, and the emotional toll it takes on everyone (Getty included).","85","5294550"
"16784","Working with the great cinematographer Roger Deakins, Mendes also presents some stunning sequences of beauty in a film where you might not expect such a thing.","85","1074638"
"16785","It's the sum of things not spoken, things too painful to express, that's the heart of this quietly moving drama.","85","203230"
"16786","Sully, an honest, skillful rumination on what makes a hero, is just one more example of how Eastwood, having directed movies only slightly longer than his protagonist had been flying planes, is still a masterful pilot himself.","85","3263904"
"16787","Mitchell brings respect, tenderness and a generous helping of his antic wit to Rabbit Hole, not to mention a rare gift for adding visual radiance to a talky stage play.","85","935075"
"16788","Willis puts his action-hero stereotype on the back burner to deliver one of his most intriguing roles since ""12 Monkeys.""","85","167404"
"16789","Let Me In is a chilly little story set in a very cold place. But Reeves still knows when to go for the burn.","85","1228987"
"16790","Like its star, Salt is a spare and lean piece of work; it's everything a modern action movie should be, a picture made with confidence but not arrogance, one that believes so wholeheartedly in its outlandish plot twists that they come to make perfect alt-universe sense.","85","944835"
"16791","The Coens revel in both the glamour and the squalor of post-war Hollywood with a film that more than makes up in wit and flash what it might lack in substance.","85","475290"
"16792","If you’re put off by the filmmaker’s previous work, then the autobiographical Sing Street isn’t going to be the movie that wins you over. But fans of Carney’s lush romanticism and hook-laden lyricism will be thrilled to add this one to their playlist.","85","3544112"
"16793","Knightley shines in period films (Anna Karenina, Pride & Prejudice) and here inflects Colette with a boldness and forthrightness that create a bridge between Belle Epoque Paris and today's zeitgeist.","85","5437928"
"16794","Crazy Rich Asians stuns with its glamour, and gives us the sort of vicarious wish fulfillment that is the appeal of Cinderella stories the world over.","85","3104988"
"16795","Never Look Away, a cohesively integrated collage of many genres (history, war, crime, medical drama with romance and spectacle), is also a feast of fine acting and magnificent visuals. But with so much going on, viewers, as if confronting impressionistic paintings or pixel-based photorealistic portraitures, need to step away to get a better picture.","85","5311542"
"16796","Byrne is a stand-up poet the way some actors are stand-up comics. His innate depth prompts The Usual Suspects to transcend its own cleverness--and this is the movie's smartest, least predictable surprise.","85","114814"
"16797","About Time is ... about time: It asks us to reflect on how we all use that resource, how the hours and minutes that make up a day or a life align with our intentions and values.","85","2194499"
"16798","A Separation doesn't try to make easy sense of that world, or of this family's suffering. It's simply a quiet cry of anguish.","85","1832382"
"16799","When Allen conceives of a character this great, it’s hard not to wish for him to slow down and maybe write that extra draft to refine his creation, but Blanchett – at once both repellant and eminently relatable – uses the casual tone to her advantage, the same way that monster movies use miniatures for scale.","85","2334873"
"16800","Mississippi Grind winds up being that rare beast: the buddy comedy where you’re not tired of the buddies well before the credits roll.","85","2349144"
"16801","The power of the Fiennes/Scott Thomas affair burns through the clutter (imagine ""Casablanca"" meets ""Map of the Human Heart"") making The English Patient a theatrical must-see.","85","116209"
"16802","Director Dean DeBlois has been saying this installment is the middle movie in a How to Train Your Dragon trilogy. It's clear that he took inspiration from the first Star Wars trilogy — not a bad model for breathing new life, and yes, a bit of fire, into one of Hollywood's more nuanced animated franchises.","85","1646971"
"16803","Handsome and moving if a bit cautious, “Battle” is full of smart complexities and sensational acting, and it deserves to be considered a serious awards contender.","85","4622512"
"16804","The relationship between Carell, Fishburne, and Cranston feels genuine. It’s weird, they really don’t click at first – like, I suspect, a lot of people wouldn’t after having not seen each other in 30 some years – but by the end these three very different people have a bond. And it culminates with a pretty heartbreaking scene.","85","6018306"
"16805","For all its strife and sorrow, Marriage Story is a generous film. It sensitively acknowledges the ways people fail each other, and the ways they don’t. It’s well worth your time. Maybe don’t watch it with your spouse, though.","85","7653254"
"16806","As Motherless Brooklyn reaches back in time to explore racism and New York City’s history, it also brings us urgently back to right now — how we look at politics and leadership, what offenses we’re willing to accept, what ideals are still worth fighting for.","85","385887"
"16807","Chaganty and co-writer Sev Ohanian refrained from facilitating a cautionary tale centered on the unspeakable dangers that lie ahead with every click. Their approach concentrates on experiences that are collectively understood in relation to modern artifacts and how they transform our codes of conduct.","85","7668870"
"16808","The film hits all the necessary beats for a straightforward horror film in an eerie post-apocalyptic setting. But it’s more effective as a portrait of four people who have constructed a deceptively peaceful life under the constant, inescapable threat of death.","85","6644200"
"16809","The shivery crazy moments land, and a surprisingly emotional beat at the close of the film does, too. As nutty and off-the-wall as Suspiria is, it has a firm sense of control and proportion. It’s a loose and rambly thing that’s also tightly made, somehow.","85","1034415"
"16810","The act of recreating the voice of others, albeit illegally, ultimately empowered Israel to write the well-received memoir on which this film was based. And the act of playing Lee Israel will, with any luck, empower more filmmakers to think of Melissa McCarthy as an actress whose gifts range beyond broad comedy.","85","4595882"
"16811","One of this year's most dazzling entertainments, not to mention one of the best comic-book movies ever made.","85","120903"
"16812","In Palm Springs, the journey the central characters go on isn’t just about trying to escape the loop—it’s about understanding that no matter how tedious life might seem, there are always ways to find joy in living it.","85","9484998"
"16813","The seams definitely show in the film’s effort to contain all the comment, comedy, horror, romance and drama, but Lee handily orchestrates the layout of the period and players.","85","7349662"
"16814","There's action here, too, and a great deal of vitality that feels true both to the spirit of Collins' book and to the idea of movie entertainment as it exists.","85","1392170"
"16815","It's probably too early to peg Frankenweenie as Burton's comeback vehicle, but it's certainly the director's best movie in twenty years.","85","1142977"
"16816","Selick puts his real faith not in the gimmickry that Coraline's audiences will think they've shown up for, but in the stronger virtues that they'd likely view as old-fashioned: character, and story, and handmade figures, handmade milkshakes, handmade blades of grass, each one moving utterly persuasively as he and his animators tweak it, frame by frame.","85","327597"
"16817","Even through its absurdist, bleakly satirical lens, Bong understands that social inequity is not just theatre, but lived experience.","85","6751668"
"16818","A swift-moving, character-rich biopic whose kinetic Grand Prix sequences are constantly being overshadowed by genuinely riveting scenes of ... people talking.","85","1979320"
"16819","Olsen's performance is restrained but not tentative; you could say the same for the movie around it.","85","1441326"
"16820","Eighth Grade is an exciting directorial debut for Burnham, a precocious teen phenomenon who seems to have grown into a thoughtful adult—one who intimately knows of what he speaks. He’s made an alarmingly perceptive film that only rarely goes for the easy joke or verges toward cliché","85","7014006"
"16821","From the opening moments, the one thing clear about It Follows is that it will not follow in everyone else's footsteps.","85","3235888"
"16822","The success of this exuberant, affecting debut feature from director Benh Zeitlin depends on his ability to universalize the particular, in this case by drawing us into the perspective of a six-year-old girl living in squalor and feeling and uncertainty in the Louisiana bayou, then telling our own story from behind it.","85","2125435"
"16823","McKay's film is coated in sugar to make it go down easy, but at its center, it's a bitter pill to swallow.","85","1596363"
"16824","This workplace-as-hellscape is not new territory, exactly — the story's based on Dostoevsky, plays like Kafka, and looks like an Orwellian nightmare. But who'd complain, since it lets Jesse Eisenberg offer what amounts to an acting master-class.","85","1825157"
"16825","A psychological mystery laced with environmental disaster and alien-scary juju, Alex Garland’s elegantly unsettling Annihilation is here to shake up your night at the movies in the most mind-bendy way possible, but without foregoing the pleasures of an ambitious sci-fi entertainment.","85","2798920"
"16826","For fans of exquisitely conjured nostalgia, dosed liberally with a modern attitude, The Love Witch is a velvety melodramatic treat, and a real calling card for Biller’s playfully immersive gifts. Bring your gaze, whatever your gender.","85","3908142"
"16827","Aside from the undercurrent of pathos, it’s James Franco’s impeccable comedic timing that is the film’s ace in the hole.","85","3521126"
"16828","Vega’s remarkable as Marina. Her character never opens up to anyone, but Vega skillfully conveys an inner life governed by sadness and a will for self-preservation.","85","5639354"
"16829","The Sisters Brothers feels special. It has the painterly visuals of a classic film, but its lead characters are black-hatted villains whose road to redemption is mostly motivated by exhaustion rather than guilt. The story is grim and violent, but the brothers’ relationship is shot through with ramshackle humor, and the men they’re ultimately tasked with pursuing are portrayed as loving and idealistic—an utter rarity for this kind of story.","85","4971344"
"16830","To tell someone else’s life story — especially when it’s being told with such brutal honesty — is impressive. To do so with with warmth, intellect, and vulnerability is a Herculean feat.","85","8151874"
"16831","Messengers with the worst possible message, they nonetheless manage to be human and alive, humorous and lively. In a film that itself bears such sad tidings about the costs of war, that is an affirming, even an inspiring, gift.","85","790712"
"16832","Overlord may not be the Call of Duty: Zombies movie you were expecting, but it is a damn entertaining film about the horror of war, and the thrills of a zombie invasion.","85","4530422"
"16833","Even without its distinctive look, Shadow would be memorable, an accomplished fusion of what Zhang does well, but the visuals take it to another plane. It becomes a kind of dark dream of the past, with unmistakable reflections of the present.","85","6864046"
"16834","Contagion's restraint is marred by one element - Alan Krumwiede, the San Francisco-based activist blogger played by Jude Law, a conspiracy theorist who wields claims about uncovering the truth like a blunt instrument intended to menace.","85","1598778"
"16835","Birdman—I should probably note here that the full title is the punctuationally ridiculous Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)—is a giddy fantasia of themes and genres, and if not all of them fully cohere, then so be it. As the Birdman voice inside Riggan’s head reminds us, sometimes viewers crave pure entertainment, not just “talky, pretentious, philosophical bullshit.”","85","2562232"
"16836","The film barrels through a variety of emotional colors: scares, laughs, moments of emotional vulnerability, and it’s a testament to director Dan Trachtenberg that the pieces fit so seamlessly together.","85","1179933"
"16837","While the digital effects are undeniably contemporary, Crimson Peak is otherwise a period homage that mostly plays like a period film, rarely giving in to contemporary notions of pacing and payoff. When the scares do arrive, however, they’re effectively unsettling.","85","2554274"
"16838","The central plot is a devious one that pulls the rug out from under the audience on multiple occasions; no mean feat in a genre where every variation and outcome would seem to have been tried and tested. But what really sets Knives Out apart from the competition is its humor.","85","8946378"
"16839","The movie’s messaging is solid and persuasive, and Spielberg’s finely honed filmmaking, his sense of movement and controlled spectacle, does not fail him here.","85","6294822"
"16840","A twisted piece of grandly entertaining provocation. ... This is a dark satire that finds a way to make a case for understanding.","85","2584384"
"16841","Running through the streets of New York for the sheer hell of it, Frances has the gift of joy to her very marrow. As for Greta Gerwig, I get the feeling she's just gearing up.","85","2347569"
"16842","As you might expect from the creator of ""Inception"" and ""Memento,"" there are surprises both in the story and in the storytelling. But the biggest surprise may just be how satisfying Nolan has made his farewell to a Dark Knight trilogy that many fans will wish he'd extend to a 10-part series, at least.","85","1345836"
"16843","Mary Poppins Returns is surely not a movie for everyone. But for those with a deep fondness for the original film, it is a worthy remix.","85","5028340"
"16844","He’s not really reinventing or subverting a genre. Rather, Haynes is applying the same smarts and curiosity he always does, openly questioning why a kids’ film can’t be as absorbing and thoughtful as any other kind.","85","5208216"
"16845","Downsizing sees Payne and Taylor working on a larger palette than usual, but like their shrunken characters, the filmmakers’ humor and their sharp observation of the human condition have survived the change in size and scope.","85","1389072"
"16846","Wadjda offers an interesting contrast to films made in Iran. Where the latter country has a long cinematic tradition, Mansour's is the first feature shot entirely in Saudi Arabia.","85","2258858"
"16847","Whether Midsommar works for you depends on whether Dani’s arc lands with the emotional heft Aster desires; certainly do not go into the film expecting any high-octane kills or gorily creative set pieces.","85","8772262"
"16848","Beasts of No Nation is the kind of sincere, powerful filmmaking that gives socially conscious drama a good name.","85","1365050"
"16849","It's as subversive and penetrating a treatment of the British character as we get on the big screen, and it's why I don't mind that Leigh keeps them coming 'round with the reliability of the cocktail hour.","85","1431181"
"16850","[An] unusually unromantic approach to music education is one of many noteworthy things about Whiplash, a funny, exhilarating drama — bordering on psychological thriller.","85","2582802"
"16851","In depicting the out-of-sight, out-of-mind bubble mentality of Israel’s civilian citizens (and how easily that bubble can burst), Foxtrot is a uniquely powerful work.","85","6896536"
"16852","The ""black maid"" may be a cliché. But when was the last time we saw a story told from her point of view?","85","1454029"
"16853","Prone to long, leisurely exchanges, and frequently darkly funny, Scorsese's narrative has an almost Zelig-like quality in terms of the notorious figures that passed through Frank's orbit. Pacino, meanwhile, is the explosive counterpoint to De Niro's clenched character, the real raging bull here.","85","1302006"
"16854","Paul Schrader has always been a faith-based filmmaker in the truest and most challenging sense, and First Reformed is the sort of stimulating work that a writer-director of a certain age can deliver when he returns to his creative sweet spot; rejoice, Schrader fans, rejoice.","85","6053438"
"16855","Nocturnal Animals packs a real punch and confirms that “A Single Man” was no fluke.","85","4550098"
"16856","Mostly, the cat-and-mouse of Lowery’s film is just reason enough to contemplate the shuffling everydayness of life, of how we are ever aware of its finality while also tending to, seeking out, and appreciating the little joys, mercies, and adventures of it.","85","2837574"
"16857","Most of all, Coco hums with the idea that we’re kept alive by the stories people tell about us when we’re gone. Whether Coco itself will be an eternal story is iffy. But I’m glad it’s with us today.","85","2380307"
"16858","Bad Teacher is hardly a perfect picture, but in the context of every other comedy on the summer movie landscape - from the faux empowerment of ""Bridesmaids"" to the neurotic frat-guy heteromania of ""The Hangover Part II"" - it feels revolutionary.","85","1284575"
"16859","Thor: Ragnarok is by far the most unusual of the Marvel movies – a crazy, colorful, ambitious, hilarious ride through the cosmos – even surpassing the Guardians of the Galaxy movies as the former holder of that title. And it’s by far the funniest.","85","3501632"
"16860","An exhilarating and at times operatic film.","85","175880"
"16861","The film's greatest accomplishment is its ability to change tone at least three times without losing the audience.","85","1017460"
"16862","A small, melancholy movie that explores cultural differences and dealing with death in an utterly charming, understated manner.","85","8637428"
"16863","Judged on a curve, set by the testosterone-fueled raunch-a-thons that have dominated teen comedies from ""American Pie"" to ""Superbad"" and beyond, Easy A deserves an A+, with extra credit for lack of misogyny, c--- talk, or flatulence.","85","1282140"
"16864","Sicario calls to mind the films of the 1970s — not necessarily the ones we think of as capital-I Important, but the seamy, sweaty thrillers that subtly slipped in anti-establishmentarian messages amid the violence. It mixes arthouse and grindhouse into a most satisfying cocktail.","85","3397884"
"16865","O’Connor’s work here behind the camera is equal to Affleck’s in front of it, as the two of them navigate this character’s complex minefield of shortcomings both earned and adopted, never letting him off the hook but attempting to explore and understand how and why these destructive patterns of behavior settle into rhythm.","85","8544498"
"16866","The Lion King is, for the most part, a shot-for-shot remake of the original from 1994, but unlike the Beauty and the Beast remake, this photo-realistic Lion King leaps ahead of the original as the better picture.","85","6105098"
"16867","It’s all about the performances. McConaughey and Leto don’t just give voice to the disenfranchised of the 1980s, but all people suddenly faced with impossible challenges.","85","790636"
"16868","Like all her (Holofcener) movies, Please Give is multitonal, as tenderly sympathetic as it is tough toward all its tortured, even unlikable characters.","85","878835"
"16869","Redgrave puts all she’s got into something other actors might just toss off or throw away. She’s present every moment; this is an actress who doesn’t have a second to waste.","85","892318"
"16870","The scary and powerful Doctor Sleep works best when doing its own thing rather than recreating parts of The Shining.","85","5606664"
"16871","Even though the story isn't as impactful as its stylized packaging, Wright creates a delightful new film that is sure to satisfy his legions of fans.","85","3890160"
"16872","One of those big, extravagant-looking romances that you might automatically deem ""conventional"" - except for the fact that almost nobody makes big, extravagant-looking romances anymore.","85","1067583"
"16873","For all its borrowing from old Hollywood, I don't think War Horse is particularly nostalgic. The word I'd use is wistful. It's the largest, most lavish handful of wistfulness money can buy, and sometimes it's too much. Yet it's nice to know that even Steven Spielberg can still wish for something.","85","1568911"
"16874","With movies experiencing a glaring dearth in quietly human, perceptively satirical comedy, the appearance of Brad’s Status is something of a breath of fresh air. Even if that atmosphere is the occasionally sour odor of regret, the sharply drawn, considerate nature of White’s approach allows us to enjoy the tang and sweetness simultaneously.","85","5884230"
"16875","On its own terms, Tamara Drewe is a hugely exuberant black comedy, unfolding over four scenic seasons at a writer's retreat set in a rose-strewn village overrun by city bobos in search of authenticity.","85","1486190"
"16876","The heartbreaking bravery of Barry Jenkins’ third brilliant film is that he rests upon a clean, aching ambiguity: Such hope is both enough, and will never be enough, because nearly 50 years later nothing has changed.","85","7125860"
"16877","Craig has one clear advantage over Michael Nyqvist, the actor who played the same character in the Swedish Girl movies: He has erotic charisma to spare, as opposed to Nyqvist's perfunctory, doughy sexuality.","85","1568346"
"16878","On its face, Winter's Bone, like ""Down to the Bone,"" is a bleakly realist drama about a community decimated by poverty and hopelessness, yet bound together by deep ties of class, gender and blood.","85","1399683"
"16879","As a whole, however, Ruby Sparks lands like a punch. It's a smart counter-jab to the many movies out there that put forth the myth that the world is full of quirky angels in ballet flats who are just waiting for some morose protagonist to come along in need of their love.","85","1839492"
"16880","The faces of these performers - particularly Williams' - are the key to Blue Valentine.","85","1120985"
"16881","If the movie's mix of nihilistic violence and snarky attitude suggests ""In Bruges,"" it's a family resemblance. The writer-director of that film, which also starred Gleeson, is Martin McDonagh, the younger brother of this one's. Despite the similarities, the older McDonagh has a lighter touch. Where ""In Bruges"" ultimately became a mechanical bloodbath, The Guard scampers quickly through the action scenes, delivering commentary on genre conventions as it goes.","85","1540133"
"16882","Beginners is all about beginnings that begin with endings - the point, Mills seems to be saying, is that sometimes you need to say good-bye to make room for hello.","85","1532503"
"16883","It’s obvious Ryan Coogler didn’t direct Black Panther to make an action movie. Instead, it’s a dense movie about family, community, internal struggle, and external struggle. And it’s a movie with a lot on its mind.","85","1825683"
"16884","Hustlers would work as a goofy comedy; it works even better as a thoughtful one, crammed with killer lines and supporting work from both acting veterans (Julia Stiles) and fresh faces (Cardi B). It’s a salute to extravagance that knows when to cut loose and when to hold on quiet, introspective beats.","85","5503686"
"16885","The film earns its length not by overstuffing the frame with opulent action, but by slowing things down and basking in the charisma of its ensemble.","85","4154796"
"16886","The film is simply intent on capturing the energy of that special “us against the world” connection that can exist only in high school and unleashing it onto the screen.","85","1489887"
"16887","What I love most about Little Women is how Gerwig’s script refuses to turn each character into a stereotype of their time. There is a complexity to each character and a real arc for each.","85","3281548"
"16888","With his latest movie, Lanthimos has made a tense, heart-wrenching tale with an admirably askance view of humanity that’s a worthy successor to his prior works.","85","5715874"
"16889","It’s funny, high-spirited, and giddily loopy, a descent into madness told with the energy of a sea shanty. But it has that same attention to detail that makes Eggers such an exciting filmmaker.","85","7984734"
"16890","It’s a weird and wonderful superhero adventure that strives — and almost succeeds — to be the most epic superhero movie ever made.","85","1477834"
"16891","On the surface a tense investigative piece with Renner as a regular Sherlock of the snow, it also slips in cogent and damning points about the limitations and dead ends virtually forced on many residents of Native American reservations.","85","5362988"
"16892","For a film about repetition, Edge of Tomorrow never feels tired or familiar.","85","1631867"
"16893","It’s breathtaking to watch the director work on such a grand scale, but the humans within his film do sometimes get lost. For all Nolan’s metaphysical mastery, there’s an undeniable coldness to his twilight world.","85","6723592"
"16894","A feral and staggeringly well-conceived revenge saga.","86","2359024"
"16895","Russell has combined pathos, terror, and black comedy with a dollop of Hollywood feel-good patriotism to make one of the best studio efforts this year.","86","120188"
"16896","What ultimately works most profoundly for the film is that its intimacy, its specificity, feels less like the culmination of Joan’s life experiences and more like an epiphany, or maybe an origin story, for what’s yet to come from her.","86","3750872"
"16897","Search is shockingly effective, not just in creating a sense of constant, palpable tension, but also in the way it pulls off authentic, effective emotional beats.","86","7668870"
"16898","Hereditary is a hell of an intense ride, made for a crowd that enjoys heart-clutching adrenaline spikes. The cast is unerringly terrific.","86","7784604"
"16899","Rush is one of those rare sports movies that’s compelling as both a drama and a spectacle.","86","1979320"
"16900","The result is a comedy so black that it recalls the words of the immortal Nigel Tufnel: It could be “none more black.”","86","4686844"
"16901","Ejiofor’s tightly clenched conviction perfectly embodies hope and righteousness against all odds. He gives the best performance of his career to date, and what’s more, he gives “Slave” its bruised, beating heart with every scene.","86","2024544"
"16902","By the end of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, the audience is unlikely to feel they’ve seen anything that different from Vol. 1, but it’s clear that Gunn and company knew exactly what qualities made the first film so enjoyable, and what they needed to do to make sure this particular sequel was worth the wait.","86","3896198"
"16903","The Past is just about as good as a relationship drama is ever going to get. The plot is teased out with deliberate grace, the performances are sublime and the revelations, even the most melodramatic, feel right and true. It’s big canvas stuff painted by a new master.","86","2404461"
"16904","Hathaway delivers a sharp, witty dissection of female celebrity, at once impenetrably vain and entitled, yet also riven with self-doubt. It is both the most pointed and most amusing way in which the movie toys with gender expectations.","86","5164214"
"16905","Uncharacteristically loose and deceptively frivolous, The Bling Ring is as much of an attack on The Hills Generation as any of Coppola’s previous films were an exercise in self-pity, which is to say not at all.","86","2132285"
"16906","Wiseman’s top-down approach to looking at government is both effective at sketching out the priorities of those in charge as well as demonstrating what they’re actually able to execute.","86","12094720"
"16907","For those capable of falling into the spell del Toro is casting, The Shape of Water is a breathless film, anchored by Hawkins’ visible, ardent longing for connection, and her fierce defiance when the things she loves are threatened.","87","5580390"
"16908","Brigsby Bear holds together because it’s so flawlessly navigated and so utterly sincere. James has his ups and downs, but they aren’t manipulative, cheap, or calculated.","87","5805752"
"16909","The Wife is an astute character study thanks in large part to Jane Anderson’s winning screenplay.","87","3750872"
"16910","A Simple Favor is a sharply dressed comedy-thriller, and the screenplay is even sharper. Anna Kendrick and Blake Lively dominate the screen in two of their best and funniest roles, and director Paul Feig is in rare form, using spry humor to make this subversive and creepy thriller more unusual and unpredictable.","87","7040874"
"16911","A knowing take on movies and maturity alike, The World’s End is just as thoroughly thoughtful as those which came before it, and maybe more than ever, you’ll find yourself laughing to keep from crying.","87","1213663"
"16912","It transcends the usual biopic limitations to tell a specific story about some well-known people with larger, universal implications.","87","1311071"
"16913","This repetition of old themes might suggest a filmmaker out of ideas. I’d argue the opposite: Happy End is a movie that’s fully alive, no matter how chilly it is. And its calm is a kind of rage, methodically cataloging the crimes and misdemeanors of a family that’s seemingly above consequence.","87","5304464"
"16914","Wonder Woman represents a number of delicate balancing acts: between humor and gravitas; angst and adventure; full-blown, unvarnished superhero fantasy and the DCEU’s usual unpacking of what those fantasies mean.","87","451279"
"16915","Moonlight is hypnotic not just as a character study, or as a coming-of-age story. It's hypnotic as a performance piece, full of flawless portrayals of a kid figuring out who he is, not just in relation to other people, but in relation to himself.","87","4975722"
"16916","It lacks Hitchcockian tension or Christie-level dignity, but it’s funny, surprising, and intriguing in the way it flips the usual murder-mystery script.","87","8946378"
"16917","Gone Girl is a rare bird: a tricky, weird mystery that benefits from people knowing its twist from the outset.","87","2267998"
"16918","It's a disturbing film in the best sense.","87","117951"
"16919","The third film in the arguably least-loved franchise of Kevin Feige and company’s box office-melting enterprise, it’s also the liveliest, funniest and “loosest” film of the bunch (and that includes Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2).","87","3501632"
"16920","Lusts for a feel-good ending the material doesn't comfortably provide. One can't help wondering how dismal Jerry and Dorothy's life together will be after the credits roll.","87","116695"
"16921","It gives Steve Coogan one of his finest screen roles to date and for Reilly, it’s another triumph right on the heels of “The Sisters Brothers.” Whether you adore Laurel and Hardy or have never seen them in action, this film celebrates both the artist and the tenacity it takes to remain one.","87","3385524"
"16922","What evolves among them is a kind of realistic fairy tale, sustained by the sweet gravity and guttural, deadpan minimalism of Thornton's performance.","87","117666"
"16923","Some movies, a very few, possess the purity of myth, and they don't have to be great to be greatly important. ""The Wild One"" is an example; ""Saturday Night Fever"" is another. Now add 8 Mile to that short list.","88","298203"
"16924","Production and direction wise, Wilder sustains his usual excellence. But his story is controversial and I am not one of those who can quite see The Apartment as the great comedy-drama he evidently intended it to be. He oversteps the bounds of good taste.","88","53604"
"16925","It’s a slightly insane, hilariously daring and often touching mashup of everything that makes super-flicks so darn popular with the introduction of a Spider-Man who's ready-made for today’s generation of kids.","88","4633694"
"16926","This is an old-fashioned movie done with wit, grace, smarts and style. [19 March 1999, Friday, p.A]","88","139668"
"16927","It can't be overstated just how Nothing But a Man is militantly tone-deaf to the Hollywood muzak of race relations.","88","58414"
"16928","This isn't a serious historical film. It plays different instruments than Spielberg's ""Lincoln."" Murray, who has a wider range than we sometimes realize, finds the human core of this FDR and presents it tenderly.","88","1477855"
"16929","It’s the master class put on by Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali that powers this moving and often hilarious work and gives it mass appeal.","88","6966692"
"16930","Without pushing or showing off, Miller creates a breezy comedy that pulls you up short. Buoyed by faultless actors who mesh beautifully, Maggie's Plan tickles you with laughs that can — suddenly or even days later — choke you up with emotion.","88","3471098"
"16931","It's a well-earned curtain call for some of the most beloved characters in one of the best-sustained feats of recent cinema.","88","435761"
"16932","Although the film remains continually fanciful, it always reminds us of the stakes in which precocious childhood rubs up against the possibility of a childhood denied altogether.","88","1748122"
"16933","Kline is one of the rare major actors not afraid to look like hell. And given his character's plight, his willingness to get physically unpleasant matches the emotion he brings to the part.","88","264796"
"16934","Plummer’s last-minute performance is smashing. In fact, the whole film is excellent.","88","5294550"
"16935","Bond's latest is a remarkable high watermark for the series: at once solemn and deeply funny, sexy and sad, self-conscious without all the rib-bruising elbowing.","88","1074638"
"16936","The funniest American comedy of the summer.","88","1225822"
"16937","So original that it'll be years before a major filmmaker attempts another one. We're talking black-belt cult-movie status here. [30 Mar 1988]","88","94721"
"16938","Forget its dubious ancestry as a popular TV show of the '50s. The combined charms of Maverick's genial cast, its sly script and its punchy direction make it the legitimate heir to escapist crowd-pleasers such as Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and The Sting. [20 May 1994, p.03]","88","110478"
"16939","This is a rare twisted crowd-pleaser for longtime fans as well as novices -- or for those that don't know an arachnid from an insect.","88","145487"
"16940","A sweet and delicate comedy, a film to make you hold your breath, it is so precisely devised. It has big laughs, but it never seems to make an effort for them.","88","362227"
"16941","The film simultaneously announces itself as an expressive portrait of a city, an endearing ode to male comradery, a leisurely paced hangout flick, an absurdist comedy, and a melancholic reflection on gentrification and urban black experience.","88","4353250"
"16942","Antal is a professional who respects your dollars. In a season where the blockbusters are as flat as month-old soda, that’s the most romantic gesture a commercial filmmaker can make.","88","1424381"
"16943","One of the most rewarding and engaging movies of the year. Don't miss it.","88","203230"
"16944","At its heart, this is a thrilling tribute to a modest hero who rose to an extraordinary occasion.","88","3263904"
"16945","Penn, one of Hollywood's most famous iconoclasts, must have felt instinctive sympathy with someone who told the whole world in general to leave him alone.","88","758758"
"16946","This movie has all the qualities necessary to be a crowd-pleaser: likable characters, charismatic performers, a strong, capably-executed premise, and lots of laughs.","88","107048"
"16947","It's possible to groan, chuckle, wince and be moist-eyed, sometimes in a span of seven or eight minutes.","88","126029"
"16948","Butch Cassidy's winking awareness of its own cinematic nature (from the opening ""silent movie"" train robbery to the famous closing freeze frame) and witty banter give the story a degree of charm and exuberance.","88","64115"
"16949","Working from Blatty's own screenplay, director William Friedkin sets his own unhurried pace. That pace, at times, does seem a tad glacial, and that is the film's biggest failing. But unlike so many horror flicks that followed, this one really is about something. It's about several things, actually: coming of age and letting go, mainly, as well as getting sick and growing old. [2000 re-release]","88","70047"
"16950","The movie ultimately plays as a dead-on snapshot of the much-maligned post-Baby Boomer generation. In 10 years, Reality Bites might seem dated and irrelevant. Right now, it feels remarkably astute. [18 Feb 1994, p.G5]","88","110950"
"16951","The effects work rivals the likes of “Saving Private Ryan” and, well, “Independence Day.” It’s spectacular and realistic-looking. That’s to be expected. What’s not expected is how serious-minded and well-acted the picture is.","88","6924650"
"16952","The most thoughtfully satisfying of the first six books.","88","417741"
"16953","The action scenes are, for the most part, kinetic and exciting - things that have rarely been true of fights and chases in the superhero's previous incarnations.","88","372784"
"16954","The shaggy, whimsical characters have a primal familiarity, as though they were developed by a tag team of Maurice Sendak and Walt Disney.","88","1446192"
"16955","Mostly it's worth seeing Alien, which established Scott as an A-list director, in a theater because his brilliant and often expansive visuals have always worked better on a big screen than on video.","88","78748"
"16956","An intense New York-set thriller that manages to be both commercial and contemplative, kick-ass and quietly, disturbingly insinuating.","88","476964"
"16957","The Fighter is this close to a triumph: a movie that steeps us in the grit of its time and place - Lowell, Mass., in the 1990s - and electrifyingly dramatizes Ward's battles with the family that almost loved him to death.","88","964517"
"16958","Pacific Rim is, hands down, the blockbuster event of the summer — a titanic sci-fi action fantasy that has been invested, against all expectations, with a heart, a brain, and something approximating a soul.","88","1663662"
"16959","Resonates with intelligence and a poignancy made more sorrowful by what happened to all of us, but especially to New Yorkers, on that terrible day.","88","268690"
"16960","The result is an acting duet that will haunt your dreams and break your heart.","88","5580390"
"16961","Profound and superbly acted, with a moving script superbly adapted from David Lindsay-Abaire's Pulitzer-winning play.","88","935075"
"16962","The basic storyline has been done to death over the years; this is still one of the most effective and successful applications of the formula.","88","75148"
"16963","An imaginative, scary and wonderfully rendered stop-motion fright.","88","4302938"
"16964","The most sophisticated and satisfying ghost story on film since ""The Sixth Sense.""","88","230600"
"16965","An unnerving and astonishing thriller.","88","167404"
"16966","It's a heartbreaker of a coming-of-age tale, even if there's a string of exsanguinated corpses to be accounted for.","88","1228987"
"16967","The treatment of the Sioux is not only sympathetic, it's ethnographically exact. Neither Noble Savages nor Red Injuns, the natives in Dances With Wolves are differentiated human beings about to undergo cultural genocide.","88","99348"
"16968","Rivette's slow-moving but seamless study of the rituals of courtship has a disarming grace, even as its downcast hero, Depardieu's Gen. Armand de Montriveau, limps around stiffly.","88","781435"
"16969","Altman directs the complex web of social interactions with a frame that’s both inclusive and prying. And the actors he collected and dropped in Malta’s simulated community help evoke an atmosphere that is genial yet guarded. Shelly Duvall couldn’t possibly have played Olive Oyl badly.","88","81353"
"16970","Cars 2 is fun. Whether that's because John Lasseter is in touch with his inner child or mine, I cannot say.","88","1216475"
"16971","A crowd-pleasing ensemble piece, whose story goes exactly where you want it to.","88","140397"
"16972","A chase movie, a spy movie, a futuristic thriller full of colorfully bizarre characters and deftly choreographed stunt work, Children of Men works on multiple levels - as action and allegory.","88","206634"
"16973","The key to the movie's success is that it was made by people who know and doubtless even enjoy rock in all its infinite, often tedious variety. This distinguishes Spinal Tap from the usual run of spoof, created at a distance by bemused outsiders (Johnny Carson in a mop-top wig, etc.). Reiner and company actually understand the media they are lampooning; the result is not only funny, but lethal. [27 Apr 1984, p.D1]","88","88258"
"16974","Hysterical. [26 Aug 1985]","88","89886"
"16975","A richly satisfying adaptation of Louis Sachar's novel.","88","311289"
"16976","One-word reaction: bravo.","88","1193138"
"16977","Is Black Swan high-minded? I'm happy to say: No. It is extremely high-grade hokum, which is to say it offers several different and combustible varieties.","88","947798"
"16978","With the film, Lee Daniels quietly pushes his talent for hashing out visceral, violent emotions into unexpected dramatic terrain.","88","1327773"
"16979","The thing about Funny People is that it's a real movie. That means carefully written dialogue and carefully placed supporting performances -- and it's ABOUT SOMETHING.","88","1201167"
"16980","The movie is a genteel, witty soap opera designed to make everyone feel the better for having not only seen it, but having had a bit of fun.","88","116191"
"16981","It's been a long time since intellectual sparring created such excitement onscreen. I've heard a few critics dismiss this mind-bender as hopelessly old-hat. Ha! If so, long live retro. ​","88","2084970"
"16982","A slick, scary, funny Creature Feature, beautifully photographed and splendidly acted in high adventure style.","88","118615"
"16983","Hitchcock's glossier and more complex remake of his classic 1934 spy thriller, with James Stewart and Doris Day as the average American couple caught in a whirlwind of intrigue and terror. [26 Nov 1999, p.A]","88","49470"
"16984","These two glam stars of French cinema – Riva in 1959's ""Hiroshima Mon Amour"" and Trintignant in 1966's ""A Man and a Woman"" – give performances of breathtaking power and beauty. Prepare for an emotional wipeout.","88","1602620"
"16985","Just plain fun. Or maybe not so plain. There's a lot of craft and slyness lurking beneath the circa-1960s goofiness.","88","427327"
"16986","A serious and funny and subtle work - a work of art - that was easy to confuse with exploitation teeny-bopper quickies because it did what the quickies had tried to do. But Diner did it right. [22 Apr 1982]","88","83833"
"16987","[Keaton and Nicholson] bring so much experience, knowledge and humor to their characters that the film works in ways the screenplay might not have even hoped for.","88","337741"
"16988","After years of diminishing returns, Woody Allen spectacularly returns to form with Vicky Cristina Barcelona, his funniest movie in years and arguably his sexiest.","88","497465"
"16989","If he had to die so soon, this movie is the best and most appropriate sendoff Lee could have hoped for.","88","109506"
"16990","Slick, silly and often extravagantly pretty, it’s a pastiche that threads a tricky needle, conveying the dual nature of cinema as an enchanting art form and a ruthless, rationalized industrial practice.","88","475290"
"16991","The French Connection is pure dynamite. Its trigger-fast, explosive scenes and high-tension chase sequences (the one in “Bullitt” pales by comparison) will have you literally gasping for breath.","88","67116"
"16992","A triumphant and heartwarming film, not an angry and scolding one, that carefully maps how excellence and determination win over the doubters.","88","4846340"
"16993","An action epic with the spirit of the Hollywood swordplay classics and the grungy ferocity of ""The Road Warrior.""","88","112573"
"16994","True, traces of his bad habits show through at certain moments, especially near the end, when a long and lachrymose scene plunges into Spielgerian sentimentality of the gooiest kind. But before that unfortunate point, Schinder's List serves up three full hours of brilliant storytelling. That's as humane and compassionate as it is gripping and provocative. [15 Dec 1993]","88","108052"
"16995","Profane, darkly funny, violent and tragic.","88","5580036"
"16996","Wonderful spirit, humanity and humor.","88","166943"
"16997","Damon is terrific. The movie lives and breathes on his performance, and he comes through in every scene.","88","3659388"
"16998","As Jim, Bale delivers a stunning performance; he appears in virtually every frame and truly seems to grow over the course of the film from a coddled rich child to a calculating, almost feral creature who will ally himself with whoever wields the most power in a given situation.","88","92965"
"16999","Order may be restored to the Circus, the ""bad"" elements weeded out, but in the jaundiced world the film has spent the last two hours so effectively delineating, the barriers between good and evil have been shown to be essentially meaningless.","88","1340800"
"17000","Has the high-octane feel of real life, closely observed.","88","181984"
"17001","It's a genteel film with a gun in its pocket, but it's also a film with a universal chord of feeling that keeps welling up from the dark surfaces and violent byways of the plot-and a final confession that both warms the heart and chills the blood.","88","257044"
"17002","After the chaos of ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,"" it's refreshing to encounter a science fiction film that respects the intelligence and attention span of an adult.","88","1182345"
"17003","If the film is less than perfect, it is because Smith is too much in love with his dialogue. Smith is a gifted comic writer who loves paradox, rhetoric and unexpected zingers from the blind side.","88","120655"
"17004","This is a very bloody fantasy (reds do eke their way into the black-and-blues), but it's hard to think of another film with as many severed heads whose overall tone is so sweet.","88","162661"
"17005","The violence in this movie is gruesome (a scene involving the disposal of bodies is particularly graphic). But the movie has many human qualities and contains what will be remembered as one of Pacino's finest scenes.","88","119008"
"17006","The definitive alien invasion movie, often imitated, never surpassed. [04 Sep 1987, p.54C]","88","46534"
"17007","Trainwreck is my favorite romantic comedy of the year, and despite (or maybe because of) all its sharp edges and cynical set pieces, it’s a movie you want to wrap your arms around, or at least give a high five.","88","3152624"
"17008","A splendid comic thriller, exciting and graceful, endlessly inventive.","88","143145"
"17009","Careful casting adds to verisimilitude. Nobody carries off a chilly authority figure like Tilda Swinton, who represents the chemical company; Pollack, who has more or less stopped directing, now embodies urbane amorality as an actor; Wilkinson, whose career has mostly been devoted to repressed or depressed characters, enjoys his turn as a bright-eyed fanatic.","88","465538"
"17010","A smart and funny movie, and the characters are in on the joke.","88","112697"
"17011","A great newspaper movie of the old-school model, calling up not only obvious comparisons with ""All the President's Men"" and ""Zodiac,"" two movies with similar devotion to the sometimes crushingly boring gumshoe part of reportage, but also Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell shouting into adjacent phones in ""His Girl Friday.""","88","1895587"
"17012","A compelling, thought-provoking, and unsettling drama.","88","340855"
"17013","Danny Boyle's effective psychological thriller.","88","111149"
"17014","This movie sends you into the night thinking, maybe even a little afraid. Bravo, Mr. Fincher.","88","443706"
"17015","Still the definitive 20th-century Texas movie. [13 June 2003, p.8E]","88","49261"
"17016","The action is contained within a coherent dramatic structure and the puzzle-box paranoia of spy-agency protocol.","88","1599348"
"17017","What finally makes the movie so compelling is director Martin Scorsese's scathing vision of New York as a fiery inferno of neon lights and relentlessly hostile populace.","88","75314"
"17018","The Doors is excessive, unsubtle, emotionally brutal and stylistically sadistic, but that's exactly right for the dark side of the sixties Morrison and his band embodied. [01 Mar 1991]","88","101761"
"17019","Nolan directs the film exactly like a great trick, so you want to see it again the second it's over. I'd call that wicked clever.","88","482571"
"17020","It sounds like rom-com hell. And it would be if Gandolfini and Louis-Dreyfus weren't such an appealing pair of misfits. It's a pleasure just to watch them spar.","88","2390361"
"17021","Despite its grandiose title, 20th Century Women unfolds as series of small moments – some hilarious and heartfelt, other silly and sorrowful – that help define the characters and their time.","88","4385888"
"17022","Mamet takes exactly those qualities that we most prize in genre movies -- characters, cleverness and high style -- and refines them to a high shine.","88","252503"
"17023","Hilariously inventive Hollywood satire.","88","258153"
"17024","Whatever you think of gay people (or politicians), you may find the movie compelling viewing.","88","1013753"
"17025","If their movie doesn't float your boat as a work of science-fiction, action, philosophy, heliocentrism, or staggering visual spectacle (although, it really should), then it certainly succeeds as a parable for cinematic ambition.","88","448134"
"17026","Admittedly, near the end, the picture loses some of itsenergy and compelling ambiguity (about a half-star's worth, I'd say).Still, by then, the big gains have been made. At its best, The NightmareBefore Christmas occupies the imaginative ground held by the likes ofWhite and Dahl and Seuss - that lovely place where, for shining moments,parents and children can travel on the same passport and smile for thesame reasons. [22 Oct 1993]","88","107688"
"17027","Blue Ruin is the rare film that is nearly consistently tense, the suspense only temporarily subsiding about an hour into the story. It's a welcome respite.","88","2359024"
"17028","This picture boasts a story about a yarn-spinning Southern father (Albert Finney) and a sober-sided son (Billy Crudup) that gives it ballast and staying power beyond anything in previous, precious Burton fables like ""Edward Scissorhands"" or ""Ed Wood.""","88","319061"
"17029","Exists on a knife edge between comedy and sadness. There are big laughs, and then quiet moments when we're touched.","88","265666"
"17030","Sing Street is the most romantic movie you'll find anywhere these days, brimming over with music, fun and the thrill of first love.","88","3544112"
"17031","The first five minutes of this law-enforcement spoof (subtitled ''The Smell of Fear'') are hilarious, as police Lt. Frank Drebin (Leslie Nielsen) brings havoc to a White House dinner that features George and Barbara Bush. Although the movie slows down somewhat after that, there are enough giggles and bellylaughs along the way to make this summer comedy hard to resist. [28 June 1991, p.3F]","88","102510"
"17032","Writer-director Damián Szifron hasn't made one film — he's made six, stitched together under one title and sent out to a world that may not be ready. Screw the pussies. Wild Tales is gleefully out for blood.","88","3011894"
"17033","It creates original characters - Hudson and, especially, the little dynamo M. J. - and makes them more important than the plot. We care, and that's the key.","88","112722"
"17034","Built from a perfect story-telling collaboration.","88","404203"
"17035","With a smart, perceptive script from first-time director Kelly Fremon Craig and an arresting lead performance by Hailee Steinfeld, the film rises to the top of a crowded genre.","88","1878870"
"17036","Things are never exactly what they seem here — but there’s a deeper, more authentic story Reitman and Cody are interested in telling, even when — maybe especially when — the film veers toward fantasy. If Tully is a movie that cheats, even lies to us a little bit, it’s to get at a more real and recognizable truth.","88","5610554"
"17037","A head-clearing, mind-blowing blast from the past - one of the year's best.","88","270288"
"17038","The writer-director waited until he had the clout, budget and prestige to attract a top-flight cast, then turned Colored Girls into a movie with a little less darkness but plenty of heart and guts.","88","1405500"
"17039","The film -- lame of title but big on fun.","88","1092026"
"17040","The problem with End of Watch, a gripping police drama, is director David Ayer's stylistic decision to shoot nearly the entire movie tripod-less. Or, to put it another way, there's a whole lotta shakin' going on.","88","1855199"
"17041","The result is a movie of enormous intelligence.","88","1441951"
"17042","With its mix of Lewis Carroll and William Gibson; Japanese anime and Chinese chopsocky; mythological allusions, and machine-made illusion, offers a couple of hours of escapist fun.","88","133093"
"17043","The film's a little more accessible than ""Requiem for a Dream"" and a lot easier to understand than ""The Fountain,"" but its low-key grunginess may restrict its appeal to people who have liked professional wrestling and/or Rourke.","88","1125849"
"17044","If you've forgotten the kick you get from watching a globe-trotting, butt-kicking, whiplash-paced action movie done with humor, style and smarts, take a ride with The Bourne Supremacy.","88","372183"
"17045","A thoroughly entertaining thriller about a teenage video game freak who almost starts World War III. A clever warning against nuclear weapons and too much reliance on computers. Only a preachy scientist hurts a fine entertainment. [22 July 1983, p.3-10]","88","86567"
"17046","The movie is artful to a fault, with too many characters sitting in perfectly arranged, immaculately lighted rooms and talking a lot. It contains near-classic sequences, though, and splendid performances. [28 Sept 1990]","88","100150"
"17047","Back to the Future is played neither entirely seriously nor entirely for laughs, and therein lies the nature of its success. It's funny and breezy but doesn't descend to a level where the characters are little more than props for jokes.","88","88763"
"17048","Finds the right notes to negotiate its delicate subject matter.","88","118799"
"17049","A gorgeously acted, written and directed spellbinder.","88","6108178"
"17050","A slumber-party classic that belongs on the same shelf as ""Bring It On"" and ""10 Things I Hate About You."" This high-school comedy should do for its 20-year-old star, Brittany Snow, what those movies did for Kirsten Dunst and Julia Stiles.","88","455967"
"17051","So jaw-droppingly out there, so bracingly bizarre, and, much of the time, so fall-over-funny that even its flaws don't matter. Easily the oddest movie of the year, it is also one of the best.","88","120601"
"17052","For some of us, Anderson's LA lamentation is a siren song, and there's no more ardent and poetic chronicler of California mythology.","88","1791528"
"17053","Madness abounds in The Accountant, an intense, intricate, darkly amusing and action-infused thriller that doesn’t always add up but who cares, it’s BIG FUN.","88","2140479"
"17054","In a sense, the film only works because, in the real world, the system is rigged against someone like Axel Foley. Yet when Murphy seizes the screen, all bets are off, resulting in a work of racial subversion that’s both hilarious and cathartic.","88","86960"
"17055","Written with wit and nuance and sensitively directed by Maya Forbes, who makes a formidable feature-film debut, this is a movie that informs and entertains, with a centerpiece performance by the great, often underrated and always surprising Mark Ruffalo.","88","1969062"
"17056","All the President’s Men’s masterstroke is how it rejects mythologizing the pivotal history behind it, appropriately forgoing a climax by closing on a simple telex furiously relaying messages. The film doesn’t present two underdogs bringing down a president; it’s two reporters doing business as usual.","88","74119"
"17057","The new film is simply more confident, more idiosyncratically dark, weird, gnarled and twisted than ""Batman."" And because it's more obviously permeated by Burton's style and sensibility, it's also more fun. [19 June 1992, p.47]","88","103776"
"17058","Hopkins and Pryce have sensational chemistry and are rather heavenly inhabiting their character arcs, which power this pious take on “Frost/Nixon.”","88","8404614"
"17059","This film is the complete package, and offers a thoroughly satisfying two-plus hours in a darkened theater.","88","122529"
"17060","John Trank's Chronicle grows into an uncommonly entertaining movie that involves elements of a superhero origin story, a science-fic­tion fantasy and a drama about a disturbed teenager.","88","1706593"
"17061","Despite its various deficiencies and occasionally antiquated style, King Kong remains not only a milestone of movie-making, but a magical experience.","88","24216"
"17062","Fury is a guided tour through a manmade hell.","88","2713180"
"17063","Planet of the Apes became a blockbuster because it’s cannily crafted, in part, as a ripping adventure yarn, director Franklin Schaffner staging a long desert trek for survival by Taylor and his two surviving shipmates in the opening half-hour, a brilliant “hunt” sequence with gorillas pursuing the human brutes as targets and trophies (memorably enhanced by Jerry Goldsmith’s dissonant, percussive score), and a lengthy chase sequence where the escaped spaceman leaps and dodges past hairy denizens of church, museum, and marketplace.","88","63442"
"17064","But there were few, if any, better performances in 2000 than the one Blanchett gives here, and Raimi's crafty blend of dramatic realism and supernatural knowledge is one of the year's best directing con jobs.","88","219699"
"17065","This is a Noah for the 21st century, one of the most dazzling and unforgettable biblical epics ever put on film.","88","1959490"
"17066","Exhilarating, alternately funny and horrific film.","88","120188"
"17067","This is in many ways a companion piece to Haynes’ “Far From Heaven” (2002), which remains one of my favorite films so far this century.","88","2402927"
"17068","A great big snowy pleasure with an emotionally gripping core, brilliant Broadway-style songs and a crafty plot.","88","2294629"
"17069","The intimacy and honesty of the family rapport, the razor sharp dialogue and—most unexpectedly—its deeply grounded humor keep the film and its slight and compassionate story utterly engaging.","88","6662736"
"17070","Adams. From the first time we saw her on the screen, we knew what she was feeling and thinking, just from staring into those huge, hopeful and sometimes hurt eyes. Her big eyes make this Big Eyes one of the best pictures of the year.","88","1126590"
"17071","Les Miserables understandably cuts some of the stage production's numbers, but all of the major anthems are intact and wonderfully presented.","88","1707386"
"17072","It's every bit as thrilling and engrossing as the best spy thriller or cop flick.","88","181865"
"17073","The movie's only flaw is also a virtue: It's jammed with characters, stories, warmth and laughs, until at times Curtis seems to be working from a checklist of obligatory movie love situations and doesn't want to leave anything out.","88","314331"
"17074","Magnificently paced and terrifically funny at nearly every turn, Some Like It Hot was imbued with an inherent distrust of capitalism and big business that Wilder regularly expressed in an only slightly covert manner.","88","53291"
"17075","The lack of family friendliness does not diminish what del Toro has achieved with this magical motion picture.","88","457430"
"17076","With a combination of bone-dry wit and blood-drenched horror, writer-director Dan Gilroy’s Velvet Buzzsaw skewers some of the most pretentious denizens of the art world you’d ever want NOT to meet — and does so with precision and flair and pitch-black humor.","88","7043012"
"17077","May be the year's most derivative film, but it's also the most original.","88","297884"
"17078","Unlike many films that hope to be called black comedy, it does not skimp on either the black or the comedy.","88","1403177"
"17079","Punch kick stab shoot. Borrow from “Bourne” and Bond. Rinse and repeat. This is the recipe for the quite ridiculous, ultra-violent and deliriously entertaining Atomic Blonde.","88","2406566"
"17080","What a horror film SHOULD be - dark, tense, and punctuated by just enough gore to keep the viewer's flinch reflex intact.","88","884328"
"17081","Pakula’s seminal detective thriller, which is truly a piercing examination of loneliness.","88","67309"
"17082","By its end, Maren Ade's Toni Erdmann is a work of laser-guided social critique and a comedy.","88","4048272"
"17083","A dark, grisly, horrifying and intelligent thriller.","88","114369"
"17084","Although it would be an exaggeration to claim that Hanna ""has it all,"" it is a richer and more compelling white-knuckler than the average roller coaster ride into tension and mystery.","88","993842"
"17085","In this steadily gripping hothouse of a thriller, it's Cooper -- funny, fierce and bug-wild -- who gives us a look into the abyss.","88","401997"
"17086","It's a career-making performance that relies as much on charm as on acting ability -- and Mulligan has both.","88","1174732"
"17087","The rom-com ain’t dead yet. Crazy Rich Asians is a defibrillator for a genre that flatlined ages ago. This heartwarming, well-acted — and decadent — film takes you back to the greatest hits of Nancy Meyers, Richard Curtis and Nora Ephron.","88","3104988"
"17088","It's such a pleasure in so many ways that one feels like yelling, ""Welcome back."" Forget Scarface, all is forgiven. Body Double reminds us what it's like to be in the presence of an original, and that does not happen often at the movies, these days or any days. [27 Oct 1984, p.D1]","88","86984"
"17089","This is no ordinary musical. Part of its success comes because it doesn't fall for the old cliché that musicals have to make you happy. Instead of cheapening the movie version by lightening its load of despair, director Bob Fosse has gone right to the bleak heart of the material and stayed there well enough to win an Academy Award for Best Director.","88","68327"
"17090","Bob Rafelson directs in an exploratory manner that naturally syncs up with Nicholson’s intuitive performance, his formalism suggesting a fusion of vérité and expressionism.","88","65724"
"17091","At a daunting 188 minutes long, Never Look Away takes its time, doesn't force its themes. Like one of those novels that follows a family through multiple generations, Never Look Away follows Kurt from Dresden, to Düsseldorf, to Berlin.","88","5311542"
"17092","Is it better to have loved and lost than never to have logged on at all?","88","1798709"
"17093","The tender magnetism of Blythe Danner turns an intelligent, sensitive story of love among the not so young into a work of art.","88","3236120"
"17094","A modestly scaled character comedy-drama that winds up exerting an almost shockingly strong emotional force by the end.","88","4270516"
"17095","Director James Gray’s style harks back to classic space movies, such as “Alien” and “Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,” that played around with the vastness of the stars, and made it seem like there was nowhere lonelier. Ad Astra also has an old-school visual panache, with deep-colored, dramatic lighting that’s regrettably fallen out of fashion.","88","2935510"
"17096","In temperament and technique, the writer-director Noah Baumbach occupies a niche exactly between Woody Allen and Wes Anderson. Baumbach’s films are almost all about his own tribe of neurotic upper-middle-class white New Yorkers, but while he has a more novelistic distance on his characters than Allen, his visual style is less antic and whimsical — more traditional — than Anderson’s.","88","5536736"
"17097","Handsome, well-acted, well-written and beautifully directed movie.","88","119223"
"17098","Nicholson has at least three magnificent moments in Hour 2. The best is a wedding toast that comes after another that will painfully remind you of every banal wedding toast you've ever heard.","88","257360"
"17099","This gem features five topnotch, multidimensional performances in one of this summer's most engaging films.","88","842926"
"17100","The film, never sensational or saccharine, is a tough but tender tribute to the creative power of maternal love.","88","3170832"
"17101","But Jones, luminous in support in such dramas as “The Theory of Everything,” carries this picture, delivers thrilling arguments thrillingly and puts a warm, human face on a legal figure who has become liberalism’s Obi Wan Kenobi, “our only hope.”","88","4669788"
"17102","The kind of movie that gives mainstream Hollywood star vehicles a good name.","88","195685"
"17103","Evocative, mysterious and shot through with bruising humor and heartbreak, A Monster Calls gets you where you live and where there's no place to hide. There's magic in it.","88","3416532"
"17104","The Usual Suspects filled me with a highly unusual urge - to be a true ""reviewer,"" to rewind the projector and figure out this humdinger once and for all.","88","114814"
"17105","Imagine ""The Godfather"" through the eyes of a 13-year-old boy just in from the hinterlands of rural Jersey and his dad's pepper farm, and you have an idea of the originality, and the oddity, of the film. [16 Feb 1996]","88","115012"
"17106","Fused with paranoia and almost unbearable suspense, The Hurt Locker is powerful stuff.","88","887912"
"17107","This is a movie with every facet shining in place, every word charged and resonant. [23 Sept 1994]","88","111161"
"17108","Soars above the ordinary with a timely narrative and a magnetic performance by Glenn Close that is nothing short of miraculous.","88","3750872"
"17109","The most memorable aspect of Batman is the film's attention to florid detail. At times, Burton's strange touches upstage the simple good-vs.-evil parable. [23 June 1989, p.H4]","88","96895"
"17110","Six Degrees is the next best thing to a great play; a fantastically clever, verbally scintillating, consistently amusing one.","88","108149"
"17111","It offers the rare pleasure of an author directing his own book, and doing it well. No one who loves the book will complain about the movie, and especially not about its near-ideal casting.","88","1659337"
"17112","It's a popcorn-movie deluxe.","88","117500"
"17113","Decades before an apologist Western such as Kevin Costner’s Dances with Wolves, The Searchers bluntly addressed this country’s racism toward Native Americans by putting one of Hollywood’s most famous faces on it.","88","49730"
"17114","After Earth is ultimately too thin of a story to support all of its grandiose embellishments, but so what? It's better to try to pack every moment with beauty and feeling than to shrug and smirk. The film takes the characters and their feelings seriously, and lets its actors give strong, simple performances.","88","1815862"
"17115","I suspect that mainstream audiences will find plenty of things to take pleasure in, even though some viewers may be bewildered by what the Coens do. But for those who share my taste in comedy, this is a must-not-miss.","88","335245"
"17116","This is a film in which ideas resonate as well as action. Gandalf’s words to Pippin about death have a muscular poetry.","88","167260"
"17117","Barriers both transparent and persistently present encase the characters of A Separation, constricting them in ways social, cultural, religious, familial, and emotional.","88","1832382"
"17118","North by Northwest is also surprisingly forthright when it comes to sexual matters. There aren't many euphemisms or double entendres in the interaction between Thornhill and Eve.","88","53125"
"17119","The film makes more apparent than ever that Howard is quite underrated as a filmmaker, possibly because he's been hidden in full view in the mainstream for so long.","88","268978"
"17120","Rossen treats the jousts at the pool tables here like mythic battles waged by legendary knights on a playing field composed of nicotine, dirty felt and wasted dreams.","88","54997"
"17121","Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in You Were Never Really Here. His performance is damn near flammable — dangerous if you get too close.","88","5742374"
"17122","Mid90s doesn't feel like a recreation of an era so much as a lost artifact of the time. There's one predictable and regrettable narrative beat toward the end, but otherwise Hill has crafted a debut that will last a lifetime.","88","5613484"
"17123","An adventure movie of extraordinary simplicity and power.","88","162222"
"17124","Isn't just fine family entertainment, it's superior family entertainment.","88","317705"
"17125","The deployment of the hardware may be extraordinary, but it doesn't overshadow the human dimension of this summer sequel. [4 July 1990]","88","99423"
"17126","All that matters is if it's funny -- and it is.","88","1135985"
"17127","Where Happiness shines, however, is in the series of extraordinary performances given by the members of the diverse ensemble cast. Leading the group is Dylan Baker, whose turn as Bill is astounding.","88","147612"
"17128","Damon’s everyman workhorse is tragically sympathetic, plodding ahead against all odds. Copley is brilliant as the sadistic villain. Foster is … well, you gotta see it to believe it. In the meantime, you’ll be treated to one of the most entertaining action films of the year.","88","1535108"
"17129","A candy-colored fever dream is the most unforgettable movie of the year so far.","88","2101441"
"17130","Garden State is filled with characters you long to know more about, in situations to which almost anyone can relate. And that's as near a can't-miss movie formula as one can get.","88","333766"
"17131","Labyrinth packs enough surprises to captivate an audience of children and provides enough wisecracking to keep adults laughing.","88","91369"
"17132","O'Connor gives the film a dark, moody look, which is the best choice for so many roiling emotions. This is not a traditional stand-up-and-cheer fight movie; the undercurrents are too strong and deep.","88","1291584"
"17133","We should all be so lucky as to live in a world designed, peopled and manipulated by Wes Anderson. His latest film, The Grand Budapest Hotel, is a dark, daft and deft triumph of design details.","88","2278388"
"17134","It's an even rarer pleasure to see a film that combines exciting action with a smart, well-informed script and vivid yet restrained performances.","88","272020"
"17135","It's a terrific mix of screwball comedy and detective story, full of wit, romance and suspense. [23 Nov 2007, p.C10]","88","25878"
"17136","The relationship between Chris and his diminutive namesake is at the core of the film - the determination to be there for his son, no matter what; the mentoring, the pair's goofy, lovely banter. And Smith and his bright-eyed boy pull it off brilliantly.","88","454921"
"17137","Pegg and Wright are armed with an endlessly impressive arsenal of attention grabbers, from witty editing tricks to a wry soundtrack and a joke-packed script that demands multiple viewings.","88","425112"
"17138","For a movie that relies so heavily on a single, not especially groundbreaking visual effect — now you see the bogeyman, now you don’t — Lights Out is crazy scary.","88","4786282"
"17139","Want to see great acting, from comic to tragic and every electrifying stop in between? See Cate Blanchett in Blue Jasmine.","88","2334873"
"17140","In an era when most scripts are written by committees of monkeys, hearing one man's intelligent voice is an almost forgotten pleasure.","88","304141"
"17141","Tells one of those rare and entrancing stories where one thing seems to happen while another thing is really happening.","88","89424"
"17142","It's a gas, dude!","88","158983"
"17143","What makes the vivid film such an astounding effort – and one of the year's best movies – is that it’s edited seamlessly as one continuous real-time take, following a couple of Brits through rat-infested trenches, sniper-filled towns and even empty battlefields where the Grim Reaper’s been busy yet danger still looms.","88","8579674"
"17144","It's one of the most faithful movie adaptations of any Dick story to date, and it comes from the scariest of all his books, as well as the truest.","88","405296"
"17145","The movie needed great performances, and it gets them from Ryan Reynolds and Ben Mendelsohn.","88","2349144"
"17146","I'm not surprised that Rashida Jones took the lead in writing this screenplay; the way things are going now, if an actress doesn't write a good role for herself, no one else is going to write one.","88","1405365"
"17147","The Big Easy, starring Ellen Barkin and Dennis Quaid, is the sexiest, most companionable movie of the summer. Set in New Orleans, it's an amiable, loping, goof of a movie, with charm to burn and not a thought in its head.","88","92654"
"17148","This is one of the year's most unabashed and powerful love stories, using flawless performances, intelligent dialogue, crisp camera work, and loaded glances to attain a level of eroticism and emotional connection that many similar films miss.","88","116209"
"17149","Animal Kingdom moves with a brisk efficiency - Michôd trusts the viewer and doesn't waste time with unnecessary back story - and the plot twists and turns at brutal speed.","88","1313092"
"17150","To discover why movie fans are screaming for more Will Ferrell, and to savor the work of improv wizards like Carell, go see Anchorman.","88","357413"
"17151","Ambitious, stylish, and ideologically confused, The Year of Living Dangerously falters in its attempts to succeed simultaneously as thriller, romance, and political tract, while also encompassing director Peter Weir's penchant for half-baked mysticism. Still, it's a gripping film.","88","86617"
"17152","The film is an onslaught, sometimes silly, sometimes profound, but always riveting and emotional, and dazzlingly sure of itself.","88","5960374"
"17153","The most visually spectacular, action-packed and surreal of the adventures of Capt. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp).","88","449088"
"17154","It’s a touching film that entertains with warmth and humor while teaching us something about history, law and justice with enormous heart, subtlety and compassion, brilliantly acted and skillfully written. Is there anything Helen Mirren cannot do?","88","2404425"
"17155","Looks, feels and flows like a real movie. It's better than the last few Pixar features, among other things, and from where I sit that includes ""Toy Story 3.""","88","1646971"
"17156","Thanks to the stylish direction by Paul Feig, a whip-smart screenplay by Jessica Sharzer (adapting Darcey Bells’ novel) and performances that pop from the screen, A Simple Favor is a sharp-edged delight.","88","7040874"
"17157","A well-made thriller, tense and involving, and the scary thing, in these months after Watergate, is that it's all too believable.","88","73802"
"17158","If you can tell the difference between a mule and a pump, attendance at The Devil Wears Prada is mandatory. You might have to reach back to ""Funny Face"" to find a fashion movie so on-trend.","88","458352"
"17159","Battle of the Sexes stands on its own as a finely tuned period piece, a vibrant comedy, an effective character study and, yep, an inspirational sports movie.","88","4622512"
"17160","It turns out that puppets can tell us more about who we are as a nation than the most meticulous documentary. In Team America: World Police, the potty-mouthed, crazily brilliant musical from Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the result is hilarious, shocking and bound to offend nearly everyone.","88","372588"
"17161","A good film in many ways, but its best achievement is the casting of Jamal Woolard, a rapper named Gravy, in the title role.","88","472198"
"17162","A Perfect World proves again, if it needs proving, that Eastwood's directorial signature is among the strongest and surest in American movies. [24 Nov 1993, p.1C]","88","107808"
"17163","Actors tell us that dying is easy, comedy is hard. But comedies about dying are hardest of all.","88","825232"
"17164","You want a good horror film about a child from hell, you got one. Do not, under any circumstances, take children to see it. Take my word on this.","88","1148204"
"17165","THANKS to the boys of summer - nine wonderful child actors - and a sweetly nostalgic story well told by writer-director David Mickey Evans, The Sandlot is a winner. [9 Apr 1993, p.3F]","88","108037"
"17166","The director can work wonders within his celluloid universe, but when the time comes to hand us back to reality, he stumbles. With this movie, that hurts.","88","408306"
"17167","Preminger had the confidence in his performers and faith in his intelligent viewers: a happy combination.","88","52561"
"17168","Complex, knotty and at times even uncomfortable; its world has a weight and heft that makes its ultimate romanticism seem genuinely transcendant, genuinely magical. [14 April 1989]","88","98258"
"17169","Somehow Baumbach manages to find a nugget of humor at even the most painful points.","88","7653254"
"17170","You keep watching Cobb waiting for the usual lulling cliches of the sports world to arrive, but they never do. Cobb is seething and bleak and unsparing, with a blast-furnace performance by Jones, and there isn't a placating moment in it. [06 Jan 1995, p.52]","88","109450"
"17171","It's a slice of life, with all the trimmings, and one of the strongest films of the year.","88","163988"
"17172","Most movie characters are like Greek gods and comic book heroes: We learn their roles and powers at the beginning of the story, and they never change. Here are complex, troubled, flawed people, brave enough to breathe deeply and take one more risk with their lives.","88","308383"
"17173","A caustic, funny, low-budget treat, shot on digital video.","88","254099"
"17174","It showcases one of Whedon's greatest strengths: his ability to take previously disrespected genres - in this case the slasher film - and turn them inside-out and upside-down and every which way but loose.","88","1259521"
"17175","The movie belongs to the women, for once, and The Conjuring doesn't exploit or mangle the female characters in the usual ways. Farmiga, playing a true believer, makes every spectral sighting and human response matter; Taylor is equally fine, and when she's playing a ""hide-and-clap"" blindfold game with her girls, she's like a kid herself, about to get the jolt of her life.","88","1457767"
"17176","Not only is Pleasantville a satire, a fantasy, and a visual marvel, but it's the best kind of feel-good movie.","88","120789"
"17177","Because of the ingenious screenplay by John Orloff, precise direction by Roland Emmerich and the casting of memorable British actors, you can walk into the theater as a blank slate, follow and enjoy the story, and leave convinced - if of nothing else - that Shakespeare was a figure of compelling interest.","88","1521197"
"17178","With such smarts and outstanding special effects, I eagerly await a second Iron Man movie, which of course is virtually promised in the final scene.","88","371746"
"17179","Gorgeous set pieces thrill the senses, but there is philosophical inquiry as well. ""Alien"" was, after all, just ""Jaws"" in space, but Prometheus ponders where evil comes from and how it conquers its makers.","88","1446714"
"17180","You need to see this one on the biggest screen possible, and let it wash over you as if you had stepped inside the most incredible video game experience ever created — one in which events in the manufactured universe can have lasting and serious real-world consequences.","88","1677720"
"17181","This solo ordeal won’t be to every taste, but All Is Lost is a grand vehicle for the actor and for that viewer ready to consider his or her own mortality, the problems, conflicts, strengths and shortcomings you’re sure you leave behind when you just sail away.","88","2017038"
"17182","A meditation on the pain suffered by a mother when her child turns out to be a monster, We Need to Talk about Kevin is the perfect tonic for holiday cheer.","88","1242460"
"17183","With enough terror to satisfy modern audiences and enough underplayed plot movement to save it from conventional biopic trajectory, Harriet holds interest and invites respect. It is still not the great Civil War epic it could have been, but it’s solid enough to work, and Cynthia Erivo’s valiant and committed performance is a wonderful achievement.","88","4648786"
"17184","Undoubtedly, [the lead actors] both benefit hugely from the sharpness of Leonard's stock-in-trade dialogue: Put smart words in any actor's yap, and their performance will rise accordingly.","88","120780"
"17185","William L. Petersen (''To Live and Die in L.A.”) gives another mesmerizing, seeming nonperformance as the brilliant agent on the trail of a serial killer who has murdered families in the South. [29 Aug 1986]","88","91474"

"17187","A Quiet Place shreds the nerves, but it does so in a way that feels rewarding. You don’t just walk out having experienced a thrill ride, you walk out on a high, the kind of high that only comes from the best horror movies.","88","6644200"
"17188","Most credit goes to Coogan for the success of this odd coupling.","88","2431286"

"17192","Avatar delivers. Combining beyond-state-of-the-art moviemaking with a tried-and-true storyline and a gamer-geek sensibility - not to mention a love angle, an otherworldly bestiary, and an arsenal of 22d-century weaponry - the movie quite simply rocks.","88","499549"
"17193","A brutally funny deconstruction, a hybrid of “Watchmen” and “Superbad” filtered through John Woo. It’s a boisterously original piece of entertainment . . . that isn’t for everyone. Note the rating, which should be triple-R, as in Really, Remarkably R.","88","1250777"
"17194","The design of the film is breathtaking at times, veering from the jagged hyperbole of German expressionism to the drolleries of English comedy at its most daft, if not most broad. [7 Feb. 1992, p.G5]","88","102181"
"17195","One of those rare thrillers where the cops aren't fools, villains don't turn stupid at crucial moments, and career assassins seldom miss targets.","88","258463"
"17196","Director Luca Guadagnino pirouettes far from the easy-living, Italian-countryside romance of last year’s masterpiece “Call Me By Your Name” for an arthouse-meets-Grand Guignol reboot of one of the freakiest horror movies to come out of the 1970s. And he pulls it off in delicious, gut-punching style.","88","1034415"
"17197","The $200 million result is an irresistibly entertaining, if grandiose, saga of doomed love and directorial hubris.","88","360717"
"17198","Although the picture has not aged as well as some of its contemporaries, its themes remain germane, the story has lost none of its punch, and the performances retain their freshness.","88","73486"
"17199","In many ways, Son of Rambow plays like a pint-size, even cheekier version of the recent Michel Gondry film ""Be Kind Rewind."" Both are stories about people making movies not because it's their job but because doing so brings a vast sense of play into their lives.","88","845046"
"17200","The Arrival fulfills one of the classic functions of science fiction, which is to take a current trend and extend it to a possible (and preferably alarming) future. The Arrival gives its aliens credit for reasoning that we might almost be tempted to agree with. We're just finishing what you started, one of the aliens tells Zane, referring to the smokestacks, auto exhausts, rain forests and so on. What would have taken you 100 years will only take us 10. He, or it, has a point.","88","115571"
"17201","The intensity of the film verges on the intolerable.","88","81398"
"17202","Million Dollar Baby is a knockout. It is Clint Eastwood's baby in every respect — a movie that approaches the level of great boxing films, like ""Raging Bull,"" by using sport as a metaphor for human nature.","88","405159"
"17203","The Avengers has it all. And then some. Six superheroes for the price of one ticket... It's also the blockbuster I saw in my head when I imagined a movie that brought together the idols of the Marvel world in one, shiny, stupendously exciting package. It's ""Transformers"" with a brain, a heart and working sense of humor. Suck on that, Michael Bay. [10 May 2012, p.74]","88","848228"
"17204","Can You Ever Forgive Me? comes from a place of understanding and love that few other biopics truly dive into, and it makes this difficult character a joy to meet.","88","4595882"

"17206","Balances brains, brawn and heart in ideal proportions. The actors - some first-rate, all enjoyable - never get overshadowed by the special effects, which dazzle us without gory excess.","88","120903"
"17207","Platoon lacks the sweep, the heroic (and anti-heroic) vision of Apocalypse Now, and it lacks that film's signal strength, which was its evocation of the visceral appeal, the sheer romance of war, at least to those not fighting it. Some of Coppola's images in Apocalypse Now were among the most beautiful in contemporary film. Platoon is merely terrifying. [16 Jan 1987, p.6]","88","91763"
"17208","Perhaps the sharpest casting is J.K. Simmons as a gruff wedding guest named Roy, who got trapped in the time-loop earlier after a misguided cocaine binge with Nyles. He pops up occasionally to hunt Nyles with a bow and arrow or a shotgun to seek revenge. You will cherish the 65-year-old Oscar winner’s interpretation of being high on coke.","88","9484998"
"17209","I laughed all the way through, in fact. This is the best comedy since ""The Hangover,"" and although it's almost a scene-by-scene remake of a 2007 British movie with the same title, it's funnier than the original.","88","1321509"
"17210","The funniest movie of the year.","88","1386588"

"17218","Thompson clearly loves this story, and, even though, she's playing the less spontaneous of the older Dashwood sisters, responsible Elinor, you can feel her spirit rising out to embrace the part. It makes her beautiful to watch. [13 December 1995]","88","114388"
"17219","A film that transforms a popular work of teen fiction not just by faithfully exploring its themes but, more important, by proving those themes have a very grown-up resonance.","88","1392170"

"17227","A macabre mystery for children and a cautionary tale for their folks, Coraline is a yarn - twisty, knotty, taut - about a perennially bored girl whose parents are too preoccupied with work to pay her much mind.","88","327597"
"17228","The latest excellent effort for writer/director Bong Joon-ho (“The Host,” “Okja”) is a more entertaining version of “Roma,” an Oscar-ready, slice-of-life foreign film that challenges its audience to look inward.","88","6751668"

"17230","It is filled with good-hearted fun, with performances by actors who seem to be smacking their lips and by a certain true innocence that survives all of Reiner's satire.","88","93779"
"17231","Custody plays like a more humanistic Michael Haneke film. It’s emotionally bruising but not without some glimmer of hope, personified here by a close-up of the preternaturally kind face of a 911 dispatcher.","88","6002232"
"17232","mother! is at times horrifying, at times riveting, at times baffling, and at times like nothing you’ve ever seen before.","88","5109784"

"17235","Unfaithful doesn't push the melodrama the way ""Attraction"" did, but it lingers in the mind as much.","88","250797"

"17239","Profoundly moving and, at times, almost unbearably sad.","88","4916630"
"17240","Like the old and creaky Belafonte, the film itself seems forever on the brink of drifting away. But it's the kind of drifting that's nothing but enjoyable. In fact, it's beyond enjoyable - heading into waters full of whimsy, mystery and odd, psychedelic fish.","88","362270"
"17241","From its explosive opening sequence at a terrorist arms bazaar on the Russian border to a knockout climax on a stealth ship on the South China seas, Tomorrow Never Dies delivers what 007 aficionados demand: dynamite action, sharp one-liners and edgy style. [19 Dec 1997, p.4G]","88","120347"
"17242","Why John Cusack stopped doing this kind of movie remains one of the late-20th century’s great mysteries. Teaming him with contemporary comic vanguards Corrdry and Robinson is equal parts welcome and unexpected as the three relive the social, sexual, and Soviet fears of the era.","88","1231587"
"17243","The movie is madly, wonderfully at odds with itself.","88","1213663"
"17244","Star Wars is not a great movie in the sense that it describes the human condition. It simply is a fun picture that will appeal to those who enjoy Buck Rogers-style adventures. What places it a sizable cut about the routine is its spectacular visual effects, the best since Stanley Kubrick's ""2001."" [27 May 1977]","88","76759"
"17245","The highest praise I can give a superhero movie is that it makes me forget about its 10-cent-comic-book soul.","88","468569"
"17246","Less gloriously showy than ""Memento,"" but it proves you can still craft fine art under the auspices of a big studio.","88","278504"
"17247","A terrifically entertaining comedy-thriller, perfectly crafted by Stanley Donen from an ingenious screenplay by Peter Stone.","88","56923"
"17248","A Nightmare on Elm Street is tailor made for those who like their gore leavened with thought-provoking ideas - something that is a rarity in this genre.","88","87800"
"17249","Queen & Slim is convincingly and unapologetically multidimensional in its portrayal of its characters; as our perception of them shifts from one scene to the next, we realize they’re not ciphers for communities, cultures, arguments or belief systems, but individuals wrestling with who they are and how they present themselves to the world.","88","8722346"
"17250","The Soderbergh version is like the same story freed from the weight of Tarkovsky's solemnity. And it evokes one of the rarest of movie emotions, ironic regret.","88","307479"
"17251","It’s a deeply personal and very moving film, anchored by the best work of Antonio Banderas’ career.","88","8291806"
"17252","Calvary is a compact and biting tale of a righteous man being tested by his faith, his peers and his predicament.","88","2234003"
"17253","Nearly every scene is contrived, but Melfi has a nice way with dialogue, and the cast is uniformly outstanding.","88","2170593"
"17254","Snow White and the Huntsman reinvents the legendary story in a film of astonishing beauty and imagination.","88","1735898"
"17255","I can't pretend to know fully what Charlie Kaufman is up to in Synecdoche, New York, with all the doubled characters, dreamy reenactments, comical minutiae, and personal unhappiness. But I got a great deal of pleasure out of watching him mount his fantasia about an artist suffering not simply for his art, but because of it.","88","383028"
"17256","It's Collette, giving the performance of her career, who takes us inside Annie's breakdown in flesh and spirit and shatters what's left of our nerves. Her tour de force bristles with provocations that for sure will keep you up nights. But first you'll scream your bloody head off.","88","7784604"
"17257","It's Morgan's core script, full of humor, heartache and verbal fireworks, that lifts Rush above the ""Fast & Furious"" herd.","88","1979320"
"17258","But Mimic is superior to most of its cousins, and has been stylishly directed by Guillermo Del Toro, whose visual sense adds a certain texture that makes everything scarier and more effective.","88","119675"
"17259","Half the film, written by Coogler and Aaron Covington, revels in cliches, skillfully. The other half sidesteps them and concentrates on scenes and relationships that breathe easily and draw us in the hard way: not by narrative fiat or bald calculation, but through well-written and shrewdly acted encounters.","88","3076658"
"17260","Days of Heaven is so unapologetically beautiful, so calculatingly gorgeous, it is certain to arouse resentment in the minds of those who find visual hedonism a sin in movies, and to arouse suspicion, if not outrage, in those who require that movies have heart. [22 Sept. 1978]","88","77405"
"17261","Who'd have thought the demise of a kill-happy Russian dictator could leave you laughing helplessly? That's The Death of Stalin for you, a slapstick tragedy – and for the funniest, fiercest comedy of the year so far – from the fertile mind of Armando Iannucci, the British political satirist behind the HBO's Veep and the sensational, Strangelovian In the Loop (2009).","88","4686844"
"17262","Try not to let the film's overbearingly jaunty score get in the way. The Lady in the Van is quite a feat.","88","3722070"
"17263","Like a Les Brown tune, a really dry martini and a hug from a good buddy, Swingers makes you feel warm all over, baby.","88","117802"
"17264","By occupying their roles believably, by acting as we think their characters probably would, they save the movie from feeling like basic Hollywood action (even when it probably is). This is one of the year's best thrillers.","88","337921"
"17265","It does what it desires to do - it suspensefully squeezes the sweat out of the pores - but the salty stench it leaves behind in the persona of Annie Wilkes is a residue that transcends its intentions. [30 Nov 1990]","88","100157"
"17266","A first-rate production full of nonstop action and inventive special effects but what truly makes Robocop spellbinding is a superior script.","88","93870"
"17267","His film may offend (it very nearly makes one nauseous) but there is no doubting the fact that it is the end product of a brilliant, highly original mind.","88","66921"
"17268","Mrs. Brown will delight and touch any viewer who seeks it out.","88","119280"
"17269","If you’re looking for a film that’s guaranteed to have you gripping your seat, this is It.","88","1396484"
"17270","Today it has a classical feeling to it, with rich, on-target performances by Warren Beatty, Faye Dunaway, Gene Hackman, Estelle Parsons and Michael J. Pollard. [10 May 1991, p.65]","88","61418"
"17271","Limitless rocks.","88","1219289"
"17272","At times the film overdoes it with the clown metaphors (including the use of songs such as “Everybody Plays the Fool” and “Send in the Clowns”), and I had major misgivings about one particular subplot, but with Phoenix appearing in virtually every minute of this movie and dominating the screen with his memorably creepy turn, Joker will cling to you like the aftermath of an unfortunately realistic nightmare.","88","7286456"
"17273","An uncommonly good sports film about an uncommon sport as far as film is concerned - chess. [13 Aug 1993, p.C2]","88","108065"
"17274","Not a war film so much as the story of a personality who has found the right role to play. Scott's theatricality is electrifying.","88","66206"
"17275","Bigelow's is a synthetic talent, in the good sense of the word: Shedraws together a rich, imaginative range of cultural references (the filmnoir, the Western, the horror movie, the love story) and narrative styles (thelyrical, the expressionist, the action-based, the psychological), makingsomething new out of the traces of the old. [2 Oct 1987, p.A]","88","93605"
"17276","The Artist encapsulates everything we go to movies for: action, laughs, tears and a chance to get lost in another world. It just might leave you speechless. How can Oscar resist?","88","1655442"
"17277","True to its title, Marielle Heller's adaptation of Phoebe Gloeckner's semi-autobiographical novel has the loosely structured, unfiltered feel of a young person's diary.","88","3172532"
"17278","It is a masterpiece of design. The animated backgrounds are voluptuously illustrated, and the action often proceeds at dizzying speed, while an elaborate fabric of subtle visual cues steer the narrative. [25 Nov 1992, p.E1]","88","103639"
"17279","Possibly the best movie that could be made about Toby Young that isn't rated NC-17.","88","455538"
"17280","Carrey makes the role seem effortless; he deceives as spontaneously as others breathe.","88","1045772"
"17281","The 21-year-old actor holds his own in the emotional project opposite a couple of heavyweights, Nicole Kidman and Russell Crowe. Just as deft in his work is writer/director/co-star Joel Edgerton, who's crafted a touching look at the darker sides of evangelical belief and parental judgment.","88","7008872"
"17282","We suspect that the film will be about their various problems and that the hotel will not be as advertised. What we may not expect is what a charming, funny and heartwarming movie this is, a smoothly crafted entertainment that makes good use of seven superb veterans.","88","1412386"
"17283","Get on Up belongs, as it must, to Boseman, who delivers the kind of charisma, showmanship, sex appeal, and tireless energy that allows us to believe him as the Hardest Working Man in Show Business.","88","2473602"
"17284","If you don't get hooked on the storytelling in Fried Green Tomatoes, you'll surely be charmed by its five terrific actresses. Fried Green Tomatoes can't match the dramatic focus and rich texture of Rambling Rose, it's far more appealingly nuanced than Steel Magnolias - and with actresses like Tandy, Masterson, Bates, Parker and Tyson on the job, it's downright irresistible. [10 Jan 1992, p.73]","88","101921"
"17285","The Cider House Rules is about many things -- chance, passivity, free will and self-invention -- but ultimately it comes back to Larch, who emerges as a toweringly noble figure even in his weakest moments.","88","124315"
"17286","Serial Mom is one of the most consistently funny films in years, moving from one hilarious set piece to another just when you're sure it has nowhere left to go. [15 Apr 1994, p.G5]","88","111127"
"17287","Stunningly, it isn’t even Altman’s best film (that would be McCabe & Mrs. Miller), but Nashville is still the movie that best embodies everything that was so freeing and generous and deceptively casual about Altman’s art, and it’s the film that best represents him as a uniquely American artist.","88","73440"
"17288","Bill re-establishes that Tarantino ranks with ""Boogie Nights'"" Paul Thomas Anderson as one of the few Hollywood filmmakers of the past 25 years with the stuff to win a lifetime achievement award.","88","266697"
"17289","Can there be higher praise for a motion picture designed to capture a beloved book with fidelity, thoroughness and affection? Only this: They made it better.","88","241527"
"17290","Another remarkable addition to Eastwood's directorial canon.","88","824747"
"17291","Like Roman Polanski's ""Repulsion,"" Martha Marcy May Marlene gradually places us inside the mind of a woman who just might be insane, and in its audacious, terrifying final scene, the movie traps us there in perpetuity, refusing to provide the viewer with a way out. This time, the horror follows you home - no exit, no escape.","88","1441326"
"17292","The Rover is a sterling example of the new Australian noir.","88","2345737"
"17293","Safety Not Guaranteed not only has dialogue that's about something, but characters who have some depth and dimension.","88","1862079"
"17294","The visuals are spectacular, the 3D technology is artfully used and the storyline is jam-packed with so many funny lines, it’s hard to catch all the jokes that are delivered in rapid-fire succession.","88","1490017"
"17295","A horror-comedy about cute little Christmas toy/pets who turn into murderous monsters wreaking havoc on a Norman Rockwellian town. There's a moral there someplace.","88","87363"
"17296","An audacious, snappy visual and emotional feast of dishes both familiar and fresh. It's the first really good movie of 2001.","88","203009"
"17297","With its clever faux documentary style, this is the most imaginative science-fiction movie to come along in years.","88","1136608"
"17298","Hitchcock does a masterful job blending all of Vertigo's diverse elements together. It's a love story, a mystery, and a thriller all rolled into one. It deals with issues of obsession, psychological and physical paralysis, and the tenuous nature of romantic love. Vertigo should really be seen more than once to be fully appreciated. Many of the darker, deeper aspects only begin to bubble to the surface on subsequent viewings. [Restored version]","88","52357"
"17299","Lee uses 3D with the delicacy and lyricism of a poet. You don't just watch this movie, you live it.","88","454876"
"17300","Dunkirk is also one of the best-scored films in recent memory, and Hans Zimmer’s music plays as important a role as any character. With shades of Edward Elgar’s Enigma Variations, the melodies are glorious, yet Zimmer also creates an instrumental ticking-clock soundtrack that’s a propulsive force in the action scenes.","88","5013056"
"17301","The genius of Zootopia is that it works on two levels: It’s a timely and clever examination of the prejudices endemic to society, and also an entertaining, funny adventure about furry creatures engaged in solving a mystery.","88","2948356"
"17302","This is as anti-Hollywood a film as I have seen in recent months, one which takes conventional plot ideas and uses them not to season a melodrama, but to enrich fully three-dimensional characters and create a forceful motion picture.","88","285742"
"17303","It's based on a novel by a real chain-gang inmate, but the movie itself often seems slick and arch, like a conformist's yearning tribute to non-conformity. Yet the cast is superb: Paul Newman as the rebellious Luke, George Kennedy as his brutish sidekick, Strother Martin as a jailer (""failure to communicate"") and about a dozen supporting actors who became widely familiar faces over the next decade. [16 Jan 2009, p.C6]","88","61512"
"17304","Tom Hiddleston puts in a performance as Williams that ranks with that of Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash in “I Walk the Line.” And Hiddleston gets to do it in a better movie.","88","1490785"
"17305","Salva's view of the universe is bleak, but he communicates it with scary sincerity.","88","263488"
"17306","The computer-generated effects are a marvel. It's something of a bonus that the characters, dialogue, and story provide entertainment value of their own.","88","114709"
"17307","Norman is the ""freak"" bullied and ostracized and otherwise degraded by the alive-and-well crowd. Such is the outcast fate of most heroes in the best children's tales. And ParaNorman, a ghoulishly delightful exercise in stop-motion animation, is a very good children's tale indeed.","88","1623288"
"17308","This is largely another of Malick’s impressionistic tales of paradise lost, but here the dreamy approach feels fresh and exciting.","88","69762"
"17309","Burnham, in his debut film, makes some funny observations about growing up in the tech era.... But mostly, with glorious support from Fisher’s symphony of awkward poignancy, he makes all of us remember what it’s like to be 13.","88","7014006"
"17310","Like its predecessors (Badlands, Days of Heaven, The Thin Red Line and The New World), Tree delivers truths that don't go down easy. No one with a genuine interest in the potential of film would think of missing it.","88","478304"
"17311","No, what's most disquieting about It Follows is the way it presents sex as neither abnormal, nor beneficial.","88","3235888"
"17312","There's no doubt that it's a flawed movie, but it's one of the most wonderfully entertaining flawed movies made.","88","78346"

"17356","The movie is relentless in how it poses questions about our culture’s way of dealing with the power of female sexuality (and it wouldn’t work without Robinson, whose appearance and performance is impeccable for the job) and acknowledges that there’s not only unease in these questions and their answers but also mordant hilarity.","88","3908142"
"17357","As a director, Franco succeeds beautifully at bringing coherence to chaos, a word that accurately describes the making of this modern midnight-movie phenomenon. Do you need to see ""The Room"" to appreciate The Disaster Artist? Not really.","88","3521126"

"17363","The film is a bit long because Brest wants to give you time to believe Walsh and Mardukas' inevitable friendship. We do. And Run adds poignancy without detracting from the action. [20 July 1988]","88","95631"

"17370","Although this epic romantic melodrama is undoubtedly one of the most popular and beloved motion pictures ever to grace the silver screen, it is also arguably the most overrated. Gone with the Wind is a very good movie, perhaps bordering on being great, but its subject matter and running time (which is easily 60 minutes too long) argue against its status as a masterpiece.","88","31381"

"17378","On the basis of The Sisters Brothers, we’d all be better off handing our westerns to Frenchmen. Especially if the results do right by John C. Reilly. That fine, ursine character actor — our generation’s Wallace Beery, as I live and breathe — is one of the four corners of the movie’s acting pleasures, the other three being Joaquin Phoenix, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Riz Ahmed (HBO’s “The Night Of”).","88","4971344"

"17382","Honey Boy will break your heart. It hardly matters if you’ve never given a second thought to the circumstances of Shia LaBeouf’s life, his childhood or his rocky early adult years.

"17386","For the first time in a long time, I came out of a DC comic book movie feeling ready for a sequel. It feels right, at this actual historical moment, when men made of something less than steel are bumbling around trying to run things. Paging Paradise Island!","88","451279"

"17389","At three hours, this Western whodunit can feel like too much of a good thing. But Tarantino writes like a flamethrower. His incendiary dialogue feels like profane poetry. And the dude thinks big.","88","3460252"
"17390","Start to finish, it’s a bloody delightful romp.","88","5816682"
"17391","The movie was directed by Ted Demme, with a light touch that allows the humor to survive in spite of the gloomy thoughts and the bleak, dark, frozen winter landscape.","88","115639"
"17392","No matter which floor you're on, the huge cast is extraordinary, and Altman gives the actors free rein to bring their characters to life despite such close quarters.","88","280707"
"17393","A gripping, powerful motion picture -- arguably the most forceful depiction of Jesus' death ever to be committed to film. It leaves an indelible imprint on the psyche; viewers of this movie may never look at a crucifix in quite the same way.","88","335345"
"17394","What American Gangster does have -- what makes it such a commanding, exhilarating movie -- is a consummate love and understanding of story.","88","765429"

"17396","One of the intense pleasures of Ruben Brandt, Collector (astonishingly, it is Krstić’s first feature) is how it suggests that theft (i.e. ""collecting"") is the only way to manage obsession.","88","6241872"
"17397","Kudrow's Michele is a deadpan delight as she joins fellow misfit Romy (a deliciously funny Mira Sorvino).","88","120032"
"17398","A thrilling and infuriating burst of movie id, The Wild Bunch makes you want to slump into the dust and stare dumbly into the distance.","88","65214"
"17399","Letters From Iwo Jima, much like any war movie, honors the courage of men who took part in a war not necessarily of their making. But by placing us on the opposite side of the battlefield, the movie forces us to approach it from a fresh perspective.","88","498380"
"17400","Once the action kicks in, though, Shadow is on rails. Zhang, co-screenwriter Li Wei, cinematographer Zhao Xiaoding, production designer Horace Ma, and costumer Chen Minzheng work in seemingly perfect harmony to create a visual scheme that the director has said is based on the brush techniques of Chinese painting and calligraphy.","88","6864046"
"17401","The screenplay and the direction juggle the characters so adroitly, this is almost a wash-and-wax MASH.","88","74281"
"17402","The Breakfast Clu"" is a breath of cinematic fresh air, taking on a very real adolescent problem andoffering, in a dramatic way, a possible solution. The film is at its very best when the brainy kid wonders out loud towardthe end of the film whether any of his new-found friends will still be hisfriends come Monday morning. It's a very real question, such being the impulseto conform in high school. A simple ""hello"" between a jock and a wimp in acrowd is a big risk for both of them. [15 Feb 1985, p.A]","88","88847"
"17403","Darkly hilarious.","88","139239"

"17406","The movie is thunderously exciting, but what makes it resonate is the wrenching story we read on Damon's face. We've waited all summer for a wild ride to grab us with more than jolts. Now it's here. Hang on.","88","440963"
"17407","It works effectively as a period piece and, because of Roeg's atypical style, it retains a freshness and grittiness that allows it to work for a new generation of film-goers in much the same way it worked for those who experienced it four decades ago.","88","69995"
"17408","A study of junkie culture from the inside (not a fashionable point of view these days), Drugstore Cowboy is funny, depressive and strangely noble, often all at once. [27 Oct 1989]","88","97240"
"17409","Twenty years ago, you could view early works of big-splash directors and often tell where they were coming from - or going. Yet Soderbergh and his debut project are mysteries. What can possibly come next? You won't be able to drag me out of line opening night. [4 Aug 1989, Life, p.1D]","88","98724"
"17410","It’s perhaps the most incisive and funniest Hollywood take on Broadway since Mel Brook’s original “The Producers.”","88","2562232"

"17414","The funniest kids’ cartoon of the summer.","88","1690953"
"17415","This is a long, impeccably detailed, richly textured movie about a most unusual life, and although it's far from perfect, the sum of it achieves what Fincher set out to do in the first place: Make you blubber like a 6-year-old who just found his pet turtle lying belly-up.","88","421715"
"17416","It's a coming-of-age story - blunt, mythic, gut-wrenching.","88","1542344"
"17417","The Marx Brothers at their purest and funniest - no romantic subplot, no musical interludes with Harpo, no distractions from the fun of watching Groucho deflate Margaret Dumont as he becomes dictator of Fredonia and frivolously declares war. Cleverly directed by Leo McCarey, it was the team's least popular 1930s film, perhaps because the tone of non-stop anarchy proved too unsettling to Depression audiences. [10 May 1991, p.65]","88","23969"
"17418","Whatever its length and melodramatic third-act touches, Interstellar is a space opera truly deserving of that label, overreaching and thought-provoking, heart-tugging and pulse-pounding. It’s the sort of film that should send every other sci-fi filmmaker back to the drawing board, the way Stanley Kubrick did, a long time ago in a millennium far away.","88","816692"
"17419","An exquisite character study in grief.","88","1315981"
"17420","Charming, insightful and funny, The Meddler takes familiar material (the mother from Hell and the daughter from Hunger) and infuses it with affectionate, slap-your-thigh humor. It also crowns Susan Sarandon with one of her most endearingly irresistible roles in years.","88","4501454"
"17421","Its deadpan wit, ingenious fairy-tale premise and superbly accomplished cast will leave you feeling positively oxygenated.","88","125439"
"17422","Firth is brilliant. He’s playing a veteran super spy in a very violent but very silly movie, but even when Harry is explaining why there’s a dead stuffed dog in his bathroom, Firth gives a disciplined, serious performance.","88","2802144"
"17423","A noir masterpiece with Oscar-caliber performances, Sexy Beast slowly turns up the heat until we squirm.","88","203119"
"17424","For a nation at war with its own values, Fair Game is a compelling, pertinent and scrupulously true political thriller in the honorable tradition of ""All the President's Men.""","88","977855"
"17425","Deadpool is one of those movies that’s all the more successful for how easily it could have gone so very wrong. It’s suffused with an arch, self-aware wit...yet it takes its romance and revenge storylines just seriously enough to keep us engaged.","88","1431045"
"17426","Maybe what makesFlipped"" such a warm entertainment is how it re-creates a life we wish we'd had when we were 14.","88","817177"

"17429","Strange, funny and powerfully moving… Burton has found a way to move through camp to emotional authenticity, to communicate-through a concentration of style and an innocence of regard-a depth and sincerity of feeling that his deliberately (and often, comically) flat characters could not summon on their own. [14 Dec 1990, Friday, p.C]","88","99487"
"17430","Poltergeist's most canny conceit is how it takes the concept of a haunted house—up to that point a gothic, remote icon (you practically had to accept a dare and then drive halfway across the state to ever find yourself in one)—and plops it in the middle of the most mundane of all possible locations: American suburbia.","88","84516"
"17431","The film works because Raimi's motor-rhythmed pop sensibility was ready to take off in this movie, and does, in a series of wonderfully hyperkinetic comic-strip lurches. [24 Aug. 1990, p.34]","88","99365"
"17432","This movie is not a collection of parts from other films. It's an original, and what it does best is show how strangers can become friends, and friends can become like family.","88","112571"
"17433","Good ain't the half of it in this case - it's funny, it's endearing, it's strangely touching. [19 Aug 1994]","88","109045"
"17434","How this all finally works out is deeply satisfying. Only after the movie is over do you realize what a balancing act it was, what risks it took, what rewards it contains. A character says at one point that she has grown to like Bianca. So, heaven help us, have we.","88","805564"
"17435","A somber, meditative, almost poetic film that delivers the horrors of bondage stripped down and head-on.","88","2024544"
"17436","A loopy, loving nine innings full of comic curve balls, emotional home-runs and euphoric, summertime music.","88","94812"
"17437","[Almodóvar] may share Catholic roots with Hitchcock and Bresson, but this film’s concern with guilt, transference, fate, mystery and (more obliquely) faith connects intricately with his native culture as well as the ideas expressed in his previous films. Building on his previous work while also charting a new course, it is suffused with the casual confidence of an established master.","88","4326444"
"17438","Moore's conception of the character is compelling. She rivets us. She's assisted by the superb performances Redford has elicited from her co- stars, Sutherland and Timothy Hutton, who plays Conrad, the guilt-ridden surviving brother of the dead boy. [26 Sep 1980]","88","81283"
"17439","The movie of Fences doesn't need Hollywood bells and whistles. This writer, this director and these actors are all the magnificence required to grab your attention and hold it.","88","2671706"
"17440","Combines big laughs, a big heart and thoroughly winning characters to become the first big surprise of the fall season.","88","303714"

"17444","Even in the service of silliness, no one plays tragic, desperate, and beautiful better than Keener, who together with Carell, makes this film both laugh out loud funny and humane.","88","405422"
"17445","Rian Johnson’s Knives Out is one of the most purely entertaining films in years. It is the work of a cinematic magician, one who keeps you so focused on what the left hand is doing that you miss the right. And, in this case, it’s not just a wildly fun mystery to unravel but a scathing bit of social commentary about where America is in 2019.","88","8946378"
"17446","Marshall elicits performances from Williams and De Niro that are exceptional. Awakenings is a small, simple movie about a large, complex issue, the waste of human opportunity. [19 Dec 1990, p.C1]","88","99077"
"17447","The ending is an explanation, but not a solution. For a solution we have to think back through the whole film, and now the visual style becomes a guide. It is an illustration of the way the materials of life can be shaped for the purposes of the moment.","88","371257"
"17448","An often-wondrous comedy, just as rich and surprising as ""L.A. Confidential"" but considerably less dark.","88","185014"
"17449","The combination of the adventurous Spielbergian lens and a dynamite John Williams score jazzes up the most mundane newspaper conventions, from a copy editor striking words with a red pen to trucks rolling out with first editions. If only the same heroic anthems accompanied the writing of a movie review.","88","6294822"
"17450","An excellent movie about a real-life nail-biter, forcefully acted, true to its period and directed with clarity.","88","146309"

"17452","Here's what I most appreciate about Shannon's work with the writer-director Jeff Nichols: the subtlety.","88","1675192"
"17453","Set to an anachronistic pop soundtrack and an eye-poppingly attractive production design that would be right at home in a Wes Anderson movie, this is a film that dares you not to enjoy its material pleasures, even as you wonder if you should be laughing quite so hard at the jokes.","88","2584384"
"17454","It's a film of such multitudinous interests and storytelling pursuits that its unfolding replicates the ecstasy of newfound romance.","88","118125"

"17456","Sean Baker spends much of The Florida Project charging in vigorously nimble fashion up and down the stairs of the Magic Castle, in and out of its rooms, investing the minutia of the down-and-out lives within this little ecosystem with a bittersweet energy and significance.","88","5649144"
"17457","It has the most beautiful ending of any American film in years, a coda of reconciliation and remembrance set in a gentle L.A. rain.","88","120684"
"17458","Equal parts playful, sophisticated and engrossing, The Adjustment Bureau is like the first songbird of spring, signaling that the winter of our collective brain-freeze is over and it's safe to go back to the multiplex.","88","1385826"
"17459","The suspense becomes so unbearable that it's easy to overlook questions about whether anyone in such circumstances would continue filming.","88","185937"
"17460","The result is a foot-stomping rouser. Where else can you get a cop in his underwear boogalooing with skyscraper terrorists? [15 July 1988, Life, p.4D]","88","95016"
"17461","Easily the most searing movie-going experience of the year.","88","180093"
"17462","Baumbach, in his most compassionate film since The Squid and the Whale, catches Frances in the act of inventing herself. It's a glorious sight to see.","88","2347569"
"17463","Truly frightening and visually unique, this messy, challenging film is anchored by Tim Robbins' remarkable performance.","88","99871"
"17464","Grace and Quaid imbue what could have been caricatures--with heart, intelligence and great comic timing.","88","385267"
"17465","An Adam Sandler movie with class, and if that sounds like an oxymoron, so be it. The movie is a happy nightmare of silly-smart movie comedy that defies category - and challenges expectations involving Sandler and his pictures.","88","272338"
"17466","Steven Spielberg's film may further the heroism so associated with its subject, and favor a liberal viewpoint that leers down at the Confederates, but it's no bleeding-heart glamorization.","88","443272"
"17467","Theron is very good as a woman struggling for respect in a sexist environment. There are also small but telling performances by Susan Sarandon as Hank's worried wife, and Frances Fisher as a topless bartender who aids in the investigation.","88","478134"
"17468","Chilling and creepy, and there's no denying that the most celebrated aspect of the film -- the Clarice/Hannibal connection -- could not have been accomplished with greater skill.","88","102926"
"17469","The songs are joyful, and the plant is a foul-mouthed wonder when it begins to talk. Director Frank Oz deserves credit for staging a musical in classic form, creating nothing less than one of the year's most entertaining films. [19 Dec 1986, p.A]","88","91419"
"17470","The sheer scope of Nolan's vision – with emotion and spectacle thundering across the screen – is staggering. The Dark Knight Rises is the King Daddy of summer movie epics.","88","1345836"
"17471","Scott is able to make it fresh and lyrical, as well as give us rousingly exciting scenes of nature in eruption. [02 Feb 1996]","88","118158"
"17472","The movie is well-written, well-acted, acerbic, funny and wisely observed. Fans of the book will be glad to hear it is faithful to Green's tale.","88","2582846"
"17473","McCabe & Mrs. Miller is less a deromanticized Western than an emasculated one. It’s a de-pantsing, really, of the strong, silent men who have long dominated the genre. Drop a stronger, louder woman into their midst, and they’re done.","88","67411"
"17474","A film that's all the more intriguing for being virtually impossible to categorize.","88","2053425"
"17475","David Fincher's shockingly good film version of Gone Girl is the date-night movie of the decade for couples who dream of destroying one another.","88","2267998"
"17476","This is a serious movie about drinking but not a depressing one. You notice that in the way it handles Charlie (Aaron Paul), Kate's husband. He is also her drinking buddy. When two alcoholics are married, they value each other's company because they know they can expect forgiveness and understanding, while a civilian might not choose to share their typical days.","88","2063781"
"17477","Gladiator is designed not just to entertain, but to enthrall. It draws audiences in and immerses them in a reality that is not their own. A boisterous reaction is expected every time the protagonist defies the odds and wins a conflict, or changes the tide of battle in his favor. This is filmmaking on a grand scale.","88","172495"
"17478","Director Tom Hooper shakes things up a bit with The Danish Girl, proving that he’s capable of making a movie that’s both steeped in awards-season prestige and in possession of a pulse.","88","810819"
"17479","The crucial decision in The Reader is made by a 24-year-old youth, who has information that might help a woman about to be sentenced to life in prison, but withholds it. He is ashamed to reveal his affair with this woman. By making this decision, he shifts the film's focus from the subject of German guilt about the Holocaust and turns it on the human race in general.","88","976051"
"17480","It's a genuine shocker - a dazzler of a film - a hellishly funny picture.","88","137523"
"17481","I can say that if you liked the other Indiana Jones movies, you will like this one, and that if you did not, there is no talking to you.","88","367882"
"17482","Once The Rider hooks you – and believe me, it will – there's no way you will ever forget it.","88","6217608"
"17483","Lumet is exploring the clichés, not just using them. And he has a good feel for the big-city crowd that's quickly drawn to the action.","88","72890"
"17484","This isn't a made-for-video that they decided to put into theaters, but a version intended from the first to be theatrical. That's important, because it means more detail and complexity went into the animation.","88","120363"
"17485","A Dry White Season is a powerful movie. It is sometimes horrifying and hard to take, although there also is considerable ironic humor in the Clarence Darrow-like trial tactics of the lawyer. The cast, clearly dedicated to the project, is uniformly excellent, and there is no sense in the skillfully built, suspenseful flow of the story that this is Palcy's first major feature. [06 Oct 1989, p.3E]","88","97243"
"17486","Scorsese and Zimmerman seem to be building on Andy Warhol's proclamations about the nature of celebrity. What they've added is the sourness of it and the pointlessness, and their King of Comedy, for a while darkly funny, winds up being terribly sad. It's the most unpleasant fine film in years. [20 Mar 1983, p.L1]","88","85794"
"17487","Hard to take in its particulars.","88","117631"
"17488","South African director Gavin Hood (“X-Men Origins: Wolverine’’) pulls off some really tricky tonal shifts.","88","2057392"
"17489","An excellent crime drama in the style of Raymond Chandler, James M. Cain, and Dashiell Hammett.","88","82089"
"17490","Without ever telling viewers what to think or how to feel, it raises more questions about the corruption of crime and crime fighting than any expose or thesis.","88","1152836"
"17491","Every good actor has a season when he comes into his own, and this is Terrence Howard's time.","88","410097"
"17492","What is most wonderful about Man on the Moon, a very good film, is that it remains true to Kaufman's stubborn vision.","88","125664"
"17493","Tense car chases, action scenes handled with crisp panache and Canadian actor Ryan Gosling channelling Steve McQueen as an existential wheel man add up to make Drive one of the best arty-action films since Steven Soderbergh's ""The Limey.""","88","780504"
"17494","Broken Arrow isn't the ultimate fusion of Hong Kong surrealism and Hollywood realism, but it points the way to nerve-shattering possibilities.","88","115759"
"17495","A super cast injects it with Teddy Roosevelt vitality. [17 Nov 1995, p.D1]","88","112346"
"17496","Even in its most tedious scenes, Russian Ark is mesmerizing.","88","318034"
"17497","Anderson is like Dave Brubeck, who I'm listening to right now. He knows every note of the original song, but the fun and genius come in the way he noodles around. And in his movie's cast, especially with Owen Wilson, Anderson takes advantage of champion noodlers.","88","838221"
"17498","The effects in ""T3"" are spectacular, and the action sequences -- particularly the fights between the good and bad terminators -- are exhilarating.","88","181852"
"17499","Unsettlingly intimate, and nearly bursting with dread, My Friend Dahmer is an intriguing biopic about the early life of one of America’s most notorious serial killers, with an extraordinary and breakout per-formance by Ross Lynch at its center.","88","2291540"
"17500","Gorgeous and unpredictable, and maybe a little indulgent, Phantom Thread is another fascinating drama from Paul Thomas Anderson, with captivating lead performances by Daniel Day-Lewis and Vicky Krieps.","88","5776858"
"17501","What makes Fright Night such a hoot to this day, on top of the great performances, is the deft blending of humor and suspense that Holland manages to build in his story.","88","89175"
"17502","Recognizing that many of the movie's elements are lifted from actual events elevates the importance of what the movie has to say.","88","1024648"
"17503","You may well hate Crash, but if intensity is what you seek in a darkened theatre, you'll hate missing it even more.","88","115964"
"17504","The ads for Code of Silence look schlocky, and Chuck Norris is still identified with a series of grade-zilch karate epics, but this is a heavy-duty thriller - a slick, energetic movie with good performances and a lot of genuine human interest.","88","88936"
"17505","Lopsided comedy turned tearjerker, saved by excellent performances.","88","86425"
"17506","The chemistry between Rockwell and Kendrick drives the movie. They’re fast and wonderful together. But Mr. Right has an abundance of strong supporting performances as well.","88","2091935"
"17507","Markowitz, Daley and Goldstein sounds like a New York firm that delivers financial advice, but they're asking you to invest only $9 of your cash and 100 minutes of your time. They have written the funniest movie I've seen this year in Horrible Bosses.","88","1499658"
"17508","Hilariously overblown, ""Cruelty"" fairly pops at the seams with the beloved eccentricity of Joel and Ethan Coen, from the fiendishly ludicrous scenarios and casually tossed off visual gags to the razor-sharp repartee.","88","138524"
"17509","The satisfying and heart-wrenching climax is a last reminder that Caesar’s new adventure is one of this summer’s best.","88","3450958"
"17510","This is a self-contained story that stands nicely on its own. How novel.","88","1323594"
"17511","In true Sorkin style, the movie is all about the nonstop dialogue, which pours out at a mile-a-minute but, as a result of the way the words flow (not to mention the skill with which they are delivered), they function as momentum builders rather than verbal diarrhea.","88","4209788"
"17512","Long, patient and chilling, it vividly captures a time in America and the feel of divided Berlin in the muted blues and greys that color our memories of that “duck and cover” age.","88","3682448"
"17513","Some will write off Prisoners as shameless exploitation. But like Clint Eastwood's ""Mystic River,"" to which it's been compared, Prisoners is so artfully shaped and forcefully developed that objections fade.","88","1392214"
"17514","Inception is one of the best sci-fi movies of the new century, a mind-bender about dreams as public spaces.","88","1375666"
"17515","This is a deeply cynical movie and, in that cynicism, it finds truth.","88","1124035"
"17516","Alfonso Cuarón's triumph is an invigoratingly clean, elegant display of action choreography, a La Région Centrale you can still take grandma to see.","88","1454468"
"17517","Michael Patrick King's screenplay hits all the right notes, building on the warmth and familiarity of the series (which King also wrote).","88","1000774"
"17518","Director Ira Sachs transforms the smallest blip on life's radar, a childhood friendship, into a momentous occasion.","88","4919484"
"17519","The movie's thriller elements are given an additional gloss by the skill of the technical credits, and the wicked wit of the dialogue.","88","119174"
"17520","Portman doesn't catch fire until the second half, then heaves herself into emotional action; this suits her initially passive, mostly unthinking character. Weaving, who acts entirely with his voice, is V's ideal embodiment: witty, rueful, pitiless, visionary and mad.","88","434409"
"17521","In a watershed year for black filmmakers, Singleton has made the punchiest feature debut in recent memory. Those who complain that Lee's characters tangle up his plots will savor Singleton's flawlessly crafted edges. [12 July 1991]","88","101507"
"17522","Easily the best Wolverine outing, Logan is The Dark Knight of the mutant-filled X-franchise, a gripping film that transcends the comic-book genre by saying something important — and for Logan, that means coming to grips with needing loved ones in his life.","88","3315342"
"17523","Raimi knows how to modulate his technique, as with the coolly controlled morality tale ""A Simple Plan,"" but he's a firm believer in the power of an active, expressive camera, as well as the value of insinuation.","88","1127180"
"17524","Anne Bancroft won the Oscar playing Helen Keller's teacher, Annie Sullivan, in this intelligent adaptation of William Gibson's Broadway hit, and it's a fierce, moving job, highlighted by the incredibly savage battles between teacher Annie and pupil Helen (fellow Oscar winner Patty Duke). It's a model serious bio-drama.","88","56241"
"17525","Makes hoops look like the sexiest game in town.","88","199725"
"17526","In the hands of Nichols, Mud emerges as a thing of bruised beauty. There's magic in it.","88","1935179"
"17527","It's a wholly successful sequel - audacious, entertaining and bracingly pertinent.","88","1027718"
"17528","Cinematographer Cesar Charlone, whose burnt-orange view of the favela made ""City of God"" striking, conveys Africa's slums with equal force in somber browns and simmering yellows. At times, the inhabitants seem to be on fire in their surroundings, a fitting image for a land consigned to a hell of unhappiness.","88","387131"
"17529","Woody Allen’s Annie Hall is made of such durable stuff that it’s liked even by many of the filmmaker’s detractors, and yet it had such a troubled production that it’s a miracle it exists at all.","88","75686"
"17530","The gripping, seat- clutching suspense in this baby will pin you to your seat.","88","421239"
"17531","A reminder of just how good Hollywood storytelling can be.","88","120689"
"17532","Sensual and scary, the movie is so visually textured you feel as though you're brushing against the screen.","88","430357"
"17533","To be sure, there are goofy flourishes here, the in-jokey, left-field rummies that are the Brothers Coen's stock-in-trade. But this is altogether a quieter, more philosophical sort of endeavor.","88","243133"
"17534","This is the rare breed of Hollywood studio production that has the brash spirit of an independent picture and the sharp wit of a stand-up comic.","88","1232829"
"17535","It's rambunctious and unruly, but mesmerizing.","88","993846"
"17536","A rousing tale that combines high adventure with emotional effectiveness. This movie works because it never loses sight of the characters no matter how epic the scope becomes.","88","325710"
"17537","It's nimble, bright and funny. It doesn't dumb down. It doesn't patronize. It knows something about human nature.","88","1196141"
"17538","A movie of potent provocation and surging humanity that ranks with the year's best.","88","4196450"
"17539","Jackman’s turn doesn’t have an Oscars wow quality; nor does the movie itself. The script’s zingers can occasionally come off as store-brand “West Wing.” But it’s a fun, endlessly fascinating watch in which the big questions outweigh the tiny problem.","88","7074886"
"17540","It's a far better piece of animation than the dismal Oliver and Company of 1988 and last year's smartly conceived but indifferently executed Little Mermaid. Butoy and Gabriel obviously love their medium, the first Disney directors to do so in years.","88","100477"
"17541","Whatever you want to label this quick-paced crowd-pleaser, it is definitely one of the year's must-sees.","88","365748"
"17542","That plot gives you an idea of how casually insane this movie is, but if you’re able to radically suspend your disbelief (the story is an illogical shambles), the film offers a number of modest pleasures.","88","85636"
"17543","As is often the case with European films, the acting is superlative...The real standout, however, is newcomer Jaye Davidson, whose performance is, without exaggeration, stunning...Not to be missed.","88","104036"
"17544","A simple story about a difficult man, and it's an impressive debut from writer-director Scott Cooper.","88","1263670"
"17545","Can be best categorized as a fantasy adventure. Unlike many animated movies, it's not a musical, nor is it overstuffed with age-appropriate comedy,","88","892769"
"17546","An upscale, high-concept $40 million futuristic epic by the visionary South Korean director Bong Joon-ho. It’s too gruesome to recommend to everyone without reservation, but if you love movies, you can’t afford to miss it.","88","1706620"
"17547","A brave experiment in cinema that richly rewards the demands it makes. The result is an amazement, a film of beauty and shocking gravity.","88","1441395"
"17548","The iconic first lady is given emotional complexity and rich understanding through a stirring and ambitious performance by Natalie Portman.","88","1619029"
"17549","Certainly the best in its technical credits, and among the best in the ingenuity of its plot.","88","117731"
"17550","This is a wall-to-wall smile of a movie: big of heart and large in scale, lavishly staged, beautifully photographed and brimming with show-stopping musical numbers.","88","5028340"
"17551","As hip, funny and truthful a sleeper as has ever flown under Tinseltown's radar.","88","162346"
"17552","The film is the finest balance yet of Martin McDonagh's bleak sense of humor and offbeat moral sincerity.","88","5027774"
"17553","A movie that will be discovered, embraced and shared with friends like a favorite record album.","88","1022603"
"17554","One of the most original, and certainly among the best-acted films this year, 21 Grams focuses on people on the verge of dying, having survived death or grasping at the slender threads of new lives.","88","315733"
"17555","Labor Day is an admittedly strange hybrid. Rarely have I seen such outrageous plot points executed with such lovely grace.","88","1967545"
"17556","It is just as well that Last Crusade will indeed be Indy's last film. It would be too sad to see the series grow old and thin, like the James Bond movies.","88","97576"
"17557","What remains is a great Vangelis score, astonishing production design, Hauer's career role -- and a movie that deserves its cult reputation despite an unloving heart. [11 Sept 1992]","88","83658"
"17558","A technological landmark that couldn't look or sound better.","88","121765"
"17559","There are few films that genuinely get better with each successive viewing. The Big Lebowski is one of them. This is owed not only to its near-infinite quotability, which itself grows with time, given how much of the film’s humor is self-referential, but also because its tangled plot requires a substantial amount of unraveling before it can be fully understood and appreciated.","88","118715"
"17560","Best appreciated as a movie about being obsessed — a character trait that’s certainly not limited to chess masters.","88","1596345"
"17561","Cliches aside, there's something at work in The Peanut Butter Falcon, something eccentric and exuberant. Nilson and Schwartz's devotion to the details of Zac's world highlights Gottsagen's funny and intelligent performance, giving the film an authenticity it wouldn't otherwise have.","88","4364194"
"17562","This movie wins you over, head and heart, without cheating. It's just about perfect.","88","1606392"
"17563","With his usual consummate visual skills and his flair for the nauseatingly audacious, David Cronenberg’s written (spottily) and directed (stunningly) a movie that often makes you feel as if you'd lost contact with reality: a twisted, nightmarish tale of futuristic reality games and a couple on the run. [23 April 1999, Friday, p.D]","88","120907"
"17564","This is a delightfully goofy, self-aware movie that knows it is a movie.","88","1931533"
"17565","On the Waterfront may have baggage, but that doesn't prevent it from being one of the great American productions of the mid-20th century.","88","47296"
"17566","This is a movie to restore the faith of those who had given up on science fiction after ""The Matrix Reloaded/Revolutions."" By adeptly combining action and ideas, it proves that Hollywood can still produce astonishing entertainment.","88","343818"
"17567","Agnes of God may not seem half so profound on the screen as it did on stage, but if that is the case, it is so because Jewison's direction illuminates rather than conceals the story's essence. And this Agnes is not just a filmed play; it's a real movie, and a fine piece of work. [27 Sept 1985, p.D1]","88","88683"
"17568","Is director David Fincher's film the stuff of greatness? Not quite. But the picture is very, very good.","88","1285016"
"17569","The film should captivate anyone with a taste for bold cinematics, unpredictable storytelling, and pitch-black humor aimed at the worthiest of targets: a self-involved and self-congratulatory, industry that often gives lip service to art while worshipping the bottom line. [10 Apr 1992]","88","105151"
"17570","Bad Words, starring Jason Bateman in a tour de force of comic wickedness, takes sinful pleasure in rubbing our noses in the toxic joys of revenge.","88","2170299"
"17571","The surprise lies in Linklater's ability to breathe so much fresh life into a tired formula...This is a picture that recollects not merely a period in time but a state of mind.","88","106677"
"17572","Paris, Texas may be missing a crucial piece of authentic Americana, but it still evokes an America most Americans yearn to gaze on. An America as thorny and carnivorous as a hawk talon, as raw and smug as a downtown mural, and as sweetly enigmatic as a vacant lot that doesn’t—that can’t—exist.","88","87884"
"17573","The movie has a deliberately screw-loose feel.","88","171580"
"17574","The Sting represents one of the most popular, widely-loved films to win Best Picture in the last half-century and an example of grand entertainment.","88","70735"
"17575","Mamet's dialogue has a kind of logic, a cadence, that allows people to arrive in triumph at the ends of sentences we could not possibly have imagined. There is great energy in it. You can see the joy with which these actors get their teeth into these great lines.","88","104348"
"17576","A frequently hilarious exercise in one sex desperately trying to figure out the other.","88","207201"
"17577","Waves is unmistakably and defiantly its own thing – and when its ideas and aesthetics coalesce, it is a wonder to behold.","88","8652728"
"17578","Margot is a fleet, strangely enjoyable film, animated by the acuity of Baumbach's perceptions and -- this helps a lot -- the frequent laugh-out-loud wit of his dialogue.","88","757361"
"17579","The gifted Rees makes finding out a stirring and heartfelt journey. And Oduye is unforgettable. A star is born.","88","1233334"
"17580","When it comes to 3-D visual splendors, give me Wonderland over Pandora any day.","88","1014759"
"17581","Gloriously funky in the good old meaning of the term. Its vulgarity may be offensive, but it's also pungent and real, and it fuels some ferocious humor.","88","307987"
"17582","Tim Burton's grand guignol fantasy transforms Stephen Sondheim's 1979 musical-theater piece into a cheerfully gothic morality tale.","88","408236"
"17583","Shelton has a talent for using the specific to illustrate the universal. Avowed baseball haters loved ""Bull Durham."" And if watching golf sounds like an excellent insomnia cure, you will probably still enjoy Tin Cup.","88","117918"
"17584","Acclaimed cinematographer Jan De Bont's directing debut is a mindless, implausible, and thoroughly gripping adventure movie.","88","111257"
"17585","Creed II pulls off a rather amazing feat by adding to the luster of its predecessor and propelling the narrative into a bright future while also reaching back to honor its past, resurrecting unfinished business from “Rocky IV” and adding a dash of “Rocky III.” Pound per pound, the sequel might even be better than its predecessor.","88","6343314"
"17586","The beauty in this film is in its directness. There are some obligatory scenes. But there are also some very original and touching ones. This is a movie that has its heart in the right place.","88","102492"
"17587","This is one of the best surprises of a still-young movie year: a comedy that takes nothing seriously except fun.","88","2704998"
"17588","What fans want are good movies. This one isn't particularly funny or romantic, but it's gripping and tragic. It asks some nasty, yet profound, questions about human desire and behavior.","88","416320"
"17589","Wonderstruck is another emotional and visually gorgeous outing from director Todd Haynes.","88","5208216"
"17590","You can't root for Ronnie. You can't identify with him. You can't hope he gets the girl – any girl. But you may want to look on with stunned fascination as he ticks away, ready to explode.","88","1197628"
"17591","T2 features bigger, bolder, more energetic action sequences than its predecessor.","88","103064"
"17592","Who knows what movie Lonergan was searching for in all that footage? But what emerges from the tinkering and legal skirmishes is an occasional marvel, a kind of everyday highbrow social X-ray, Paul Mazursky by way of Krzysztof Kieslowski.","88","466893"
"17593","One of those movies in which pacing, dialogue and the right actors enliven a familiar story.","88","165854"
"17594","Fierce, fast and funny.","88","427944"
"17595","The Holiday is the type of welcome diversion that only Meyers still seems to specialize -- a romantic comedy where Barbara Stanwyck and Rosalind Russell would have been just as natural as Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet and where the one liners fly like confetti.","88","457939"
"17596","There's nothing trivial about this Hungarian masterwork from first-time director László Nemes. You don't merely witness horror, you feel it in your bones.","88","3808342"
"17597","You'll go limp from laughing.","88","910936"
"17598","And yet there is enough of a core of sincerity to turn even the most preposterous moments-such as the film's dream-sequence finale-into something moving and true: You buy the feelings, even as the situations degenerate into the ludicrous and absurd.

"17599","An enormously entertaining movie, like nothing we've ever seen before, and yet completely familiar.","88","169102"
"17600","The film moves swiftly and unerringly to its conclusion. Spielberg remains under Stanley Kubrick's directorial spell.","88","181689"
"17601","Tender Mercies builds a marvelous flow of suspense and surprise precisely by refusing to ''pay off'' on situations that would plunge toward sensationalism in any conventional picture. Add another stunning portrayal by the brilliant Duvall - who even does his own singing! - and a splendid supporting cast, and you have a movie to treasure for a very long time to come. [10 Mar 1983, p.18]","88","86423"
"17602","For Hobbitués and adventure fans of all other ages, it's the year's best thrill ride -- maybe the best film.","88","120737"
"17603","Downsizing brims over with the pleasures of the unexpected, a hallmark of Payne's artistry.","88","1389072"
"17604","The Theory of Everything, referring to Hawking's dream of finding an equation to explain all existence, is riveting science, emotional provocation and one-of-a-kind love story all rolled into one triumphant film.","88","2980516"
"17605","Movies like Hard Eight remind me of what original, compelling characters the movies can sometimes give us.","88","119256"
"17606","Here's a science fiction movie where the special effects are in the background. And the effect is, well, rather special.","88","92007"
"17607","The Tony-winning Bosco, one of the great stage actors of the last 50 years, does a lot with a little in his restricted role; he's haughty, almost dignified by his angry silence. Linney and Hoffman stay pitch-perfect in their noisy desperation and sullen withdrawal.","88","775529"
"17608","Captures the feel of a first-rate comic book. It puts the pop back into Pop Art: It blows viewers away with a blast of kinetic energy.","88","290334"
"17609","Replete with so many wisecracks, puns, double entendres and visual jokes that you almost need a flow chart to keep up with them all. But try; the effort is definitely worthwhile, and the results are hilarious.","88","318155"
"17610","Fighting With My Family works as a cheeky but never condescending story of one of those “chin-up” working-class British families so often featured in the movies, and of course primarily as the story of an undersized, overmatched outcast who is determined to succeed against all odds.","88","6513120"
"17611","Friday is funnier and funkier than ""Bad Boys,"" more homegrown-seeming, less manufactured. It plays like ""House Party"" with attitude. [26 Apr 1995]","88","113118"
"17612","Barry Lyndon isn’t a great success, and it’s not a great entertainment, but it’s a great example of directorial vision.","88","72684"
"17613","Not only is this a deftly crafted and superbly acted film, but Wadjda sheds a powerful light on what women face, starting in childhood, in an oppressive regime.","88","2258858"
"17614","An ingenious little horror film, so well made it's truly scary.","88","1179904"
"17615","This is a rare thriller that's as much character study as sound and fury.","88","369339"
"17616","As beautifully designed, swift and sleek as a classic sports car, throbbing with emotion and intelligence, it's a neat suspense film that's also dramatically and sociologically potent, with two supremely talented stars, Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn, delivering beyond the emotional call of duty.","88","373926"
"17617","The average thriller, even if it's set in a faraway or futuristic world, tends to offer visceral, ephemeral excitement, and not much else. However, while Gattaca has the energy and tautness to compare with the best of those, its thought-provoking script and thematic richness elevate it to the next level.","88","119177"
"17618","Goldfinger is studded with moments that have since become deeply embedded in the Bond mythos. John Barry's opening song (sung by Shirley Bassey) is among the series' best. Snippets of dialogue have attained an almost-legendary status, such as the exchange when Goldfinger is about to emasculate 007 with a laser. ""Do you expect me to talk?"" asks Bond. The response is succinct: ""No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!""","88","58150"
"17619","Sketch-comedy whiz Jordan Peele of TV’s ”Key and Peele” and “Keanu” has cooked up the smartest horror movie in ages, an edge-of-your-seat thriller that is entertaining and creepily enlightening at the same time.","88","5052448"
"17620","Despite a problematic ending, Midsommar is an emotionally harrowing and slowly insidious journey, languidly forcing dread on the viewer, wrapping them in a weird nightmare summer camp of sunlight and cheer.","88","8772262"
"17621","Although undeniably a western, Stagecoach transcends the genre, as both a character study of the relationships among a socially mismatched crew of stagecoach passengers and an action movie about their attempts to avoid the dangerous Geronimo and his Apache tribe. And that action, by the way, is impressive, even by today's standards. [28 May 2010, p.WE37]","88","31971"
"17622","From the first stylized shot to the final comic resolution, Moonstruck is completely sui generis - hard to describe but easy to love.","88","93565"
"17623","The film has undeniable power, but it's an unusual and unsettling power, a product of a collision between red-hot material and the cool serenity with which Kubrick observes and accepts it. [26 June 1987]","88","93058"
"17624","Since Fitzpatrick is an actor (and ""no ladies' man,"" he told Clark), this is a performance and, as such, one of the most effective I've seen. It's amazing how, watching the film, you dislike Telly so much you want to deny Fitzpatrick's accomplishment in creating him.","88","113540"
"17625","It's the remarkable Attah, whose young face reflects a hellish journey, that makes this fierce movie a blazing, indelible achievement.","88","1365050"
"17626","Some caper movies build suspense, while others tweak the genre with tongue lancing cheek. But this lesbian caper pic (how's that for a rarefied subgenre?) often pulls off both feats in the same scene, even simultaneously. [04 Oct 1996 Pg.04.D]","88","115736"
"17627","It's a case of actors and strong writing coming together, and it's uncommon in contemporary movies.","88","119822"
"17628","The romantic comedy about a divorced couple having an affair manages to be both light on its feet and heavy enough to deliver something of a message.","88","1230414"
"17629","Sequels don't get much better - or smarter - than the action-, drama-, romance- and comedy-packed Spider-Man 2, which miraculously improves on the webslinger's hugely popular first screen adventure in every imaginable department.","88","316654"
"17630","The first third is brisk and witty, the middle third gloomy and the finale of Part 1 not so much a cliffhanger as a grim, inspiring tease, a masterly build-up to put ""I can't wait for part 2"" on every Muggles' lips.","88","926084"
"17631","Director John Madden (“Shakespeare in Love,” the “Exotic Marigold Hotel” movies) expertly juggles the various subplots while never losing his main focus, which is to showcase Jessica Chastain’s nearly infinite palette of acting shades.","88","4540710"
"17632","Gilchrist (""United States of Tara"") is immensely appealing as a kid who's just a bit too wrapped up in himself to grasp that perhaps his problems aren't insurmountable.","88","804497"
"17633","Just watch the magnificent Manville, in a raw and riveting award-class performance that exposes a grieving heart under siege. Her last scene is quietly devastating. So is this intimate miracle of a movie.","88","1431181"
"17634","A little like speeding through the digestive tract of some voracious beast. There's bite, acid, digestive churning and an expulsive conclusion. If the metaphor seems unsavoury, well, wait until you see the film.","88","117951"
"17635","Patton Oswalt is, in a way, the key to the film's success. Theron is flawless at playing a cringe-inducing monster and Wilson touching as a nice guy who hates to offend her, but the audience needs a point of entry, a character we can identify with, and Oswalt's Matt is human, realistic, sardonic and self-deprecating. He speaks truth to Mavis.","88","1625346"
"17636","The thrill of watching Fletcher and Neyman's fray unfold is intensified by Damien Chazelle's attention to the craft and challenge of musicianship.","88","2582802"
"17637","Hunt is coldly clinical rather than emotionally resonant; so is the measured ensemble work of a super cast. [2 Mar 1990, Life, p.1D]","88","99810"
"17638","The songs are pure joy, for them and for us.","88","58182"
"17639","It’s a somber film with flashes of wit, with funereal pacing and long, poignant close-ups that let the players — especially Ashkenazi and Adler — let us see there’s more than what we see on the surface, just with a look.","88","6896536"
"17640","It's a sharply written, unforgettably directed character study with brilliant performances by Joaquin Phoenix, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Amy Adams - far more intimate but no less intense than director Paul Thomas Anderson's Oscar-winning last film, ""There Will Be Blood.''","88","1560747"
"17641","Even if The Mummy is imitation Spielberg, it offers more bang for the buck than we're used to getting.","88","120616"
"17642","There is no question that this film is flawed by the inclusion of the party scene and Ratzo's dream, but I cannot recall a more marvelous pair of acting performances in any one film. Dustin Hoffman deserves the Oscar for a role that is prickly on the outside, but tender on the inside.","88","64665"
"17643","A rollicking tale of rehabilitation and redemption, rife with cool special effects, Hancock is smart and surprisingly raunchy.","88","448157"
"17644","An incredibly silly film of great humor, brilliant design and epic insanity.","88","71853"
"17645","Davis and Spencer give faces and fully-fleshed out lives to women who must have been more than what they did for a living as The Help.","88","1454029"
"17646","Beloved is for those who want substance from a movie, and don't mind facing uncomfortable truths in the process.","88","120603"
"17647","Despite a few wrong turns early on, the movie gathers graceful momentum and heads straight to the warm heart of the book - that fond spot located just on the safe side of sentimentality, a feel- good place that doesn't leave any feel-stupid fallout.","88","97351"
"17648","It's a dry, mundane title. It's also the only thing about the film that doesn't blow your mind right out of its comfortable, I've-seen-all-this-before rut.","88","411477"
"17649","This Beauty and the Beast had me leaving the theater feeling utterly happy; like I’d spent time with old friends who’d grown and changed, and yet remained the same at heart.","88","2771200"
"17650","It is humane, beautifully shot in 65 mm and glorious black and white, full of keen observations, intimate details and nuanced performances. I was hypnotized and drawn in by the skill and heart of everyone involved.","88","6155172"
"17651","Kenneth Lonergan's film gradually comes to its sense of exquisitely calibrated, hardened intimacy.","88","4034228"
"17652","Coppola is a virtuoso of image and sound. but don't mistake her delicate touch for weakness. The Beguiled is a hothouse flower of startling power and intimacy. You can't shake it.","88","5592248"
"17653","A crowd pleaser that caters to our horror of totalitarianism, our love of personal freedom, our belief - justified or deluded - that knowledge is a powerful tool and that access to information is a God-given right.","88","120382"
"17654","Scorsese knows what his audience is hoping for: glory days, resurrected. But he also understands the impossibility of anyone being exactly as they once were. So he weaves that longing into both The Irishman‘s text and its technique.","88","1302006"
"17655","The tip-off that something different is afoot in Alien 3 comes right at the beginning. [22 May 1992, p.AE15]","88","103644"
"17656","Does the finest job of any film in painting a believable portrait of aging, capturing the sadness, confusion, anxiety and defiance of the early stages of dementia.","88","491747"
"17657","In The Hudsucker Proxy, the filmmaking Coen brothers make dark, startling, wittily extravagant sport of the American Dream. The movie is opulent and wry, a bitingly intelligent fable about business and romance. [25 Mar 1994, p.A]","88","110074"
"17658","Harrowing, but with a wry humor, and utterly transporting, Paul Schrader has synthesized his complex religious upbringing with modern anxieties into a trenchant portrait of tormented souls in First Reformed.","88","6053438"
"17659","All That Jazz may be Fosse’s finest cinematic achievement.","88","78754"
"17660","Upstream Color is lush, rhythmic, and deeply sensual, a film of exceptional beauty.","88","2084989"
"17661","As played by an eloquently beleaguered Oscar Isaac, Llewyn Davis is arguably the most vivid and complex character the Coens have dreamed up since Marge Gunderson.","88","2042568"
"17662","The Fly is a mass-market, horror- film masterpiece that is also a work of art; it is the very movie the timorous feared ""Aliens"" would be - a gruesome, disturbing, fundamentally uncompromising shocker that accesses the subconscious. [15 Aug 1986]","88","91064"
"17663","To ensure customer loyalty, Hollywood should promote more movies about workaday life in the provinces, but until there's a new wave of midcoast comedies, Cedar Rapids is the big kahuna.","88","1477837"
"17664","This stirring children's movie about separation anxiety is swimming with comic references only adults will catch, thus greatly expanding the potential audience.","88","266543"
"17665","The movie contains little in terms of traditional action, and Refn never uses it in a rousing or exciting manner, either. That would break the nightmarish spell this strange, beautiful film casts on the viewer. A mother’s love has never been this ruinous.","88","1602613"
"17666","Ford hits it out of the park again in Nocturnal Animals, a stunning film noir that resonates with ghostly, poetic terror.","88","4550098"
"17667","Ballooning. Biking. Swimming. Parachuting. The Great Muppet Caper represented a giant leap for Muppetkind, in only their second big-screen outing.","88","82474"
"17668","Unsurprisingly, the finale is manipulative in every way, squeezing out the emotions of the audience. But Lion’s well-plotted narrative and thoughtful characters suck you in so much that the journey there is totally worth it.","88","3741834"
"17669","Disclosure is a well-acted, slickly directed shell of a picture. The veneer is so polished that you look on with something approaching genuine satisfaction, and only after the final credits roll do you begin to feel the void.","88","109635"
"17670","Director Peter Yates brings vitality to Steve Tesich's endearing script, avoiding any temptation for cheap shots. The cast is mostly unknown and awfully good, especially Dennis Christopher as a Hoosier turned Italian and Paul Dooley as his exasperated parent. [16 July 1979]","88","78902"
"17671","The Graduate, the erratic, jet-age film at the Coronet and Lincoln Art, has two standout performances - one from a young actor, who looks as if the worries of the world rested on his sawed-off body, and another from a director, still new to movies, whose spit and polish technique at times borders on genius.","88","61722"
"17672","Its horrors go beyond any single raggedy phantom, reaching back to the primordial fear of death and loss: of a child, of a loved one, of one's own sense of self.","88","2321549"
"17673","It’s as if Moss is directing the movie through her performance.","88","7942742"
"17674","The movie works not because of twists and switchbacks in the narrative, but because of the skill with which Cortés has conceived this singularly disturbing nightmare.","88","1462758"
"17675","Handsomely mounted, skillfully acted, exquisitely photographed and genuinely touching, Testament of Youth is one of those rare film experiences that is just about perfect.","88","1441953"
"17676","However suave the movie itself may be, it's another accomplished piece of work from a filmmaker who is now four for four, and continues to surprise with the range of his interests and output. And it’s a love letter to a cinematic legend, serving as a perfect final film for someone who long ago surpassed mere actor status to become an icon.","88","2837574"
"17677","Ultimately, this is an engaging, uplifting, and life-affirming motion picture that reminds viewers that it is possible to do interesting things with a romantic comedy while still sticking to some of the conventions.","88","1045658"
"17678","The whole enterprise is amusing, warm and embracing, so much so that English words fall short of perfectly summing up this utterly charming film. Only a Spanish word will do. “Encantada.”","88","2380307"
"17679","One of the greatest mixes ever of gritty war drama and roll-on-the-floor hilarity. [29 Mar 2002, p.2A]","88","46359"
"17680","Austin is funny, extremely funny, because he is so ridiculous, and because Myers is a brilliant mimic who, like Martin Short, knows how to do ridiculous.","88","118655"
"17681","It’s too bad that Keaton plays Kroc as a grasping, alcoholic sleaze as he builds the McDonald’s brand into an all-American empire, but I forgive the movie’s cheap shots because this is one of the most thorough and satisfying depictions of business — everything from quality control to cost-cutting and branding — ever put on film.","88","4276820"
"17682","Violence in Green Room is just bad. Unfortunately for its heroes and for us all, it’s also sometimes inevitable.","88","4062536"
"17683","Douglas plays Ben as charismatic, he plays him shameless, he plays him as brave, and very gradually, he learns to play him as himself. That's the only role left.","88","1294213"
"17684","Gone Baby Gone would be an accomplishment with anyone at the helm; from a first-timer, it's a revelation.","88","452623"
"17685","The picture has fine ensemble acting and superb Italian scenery. It would have more power if it were shorter and tighter.","88","134119"
"17686","Living in Oblivion is a rarity, a dark comedy that takes place almost entirely on a film set. Written and directed by Tom DiCillo, this is a very funny picture that presents the world of independent film making as a nightmare of conflicting egos, budgetary squalor and incompetence.","88","113677"
"17687","The sharp economy of Lloyd's direction allows the incontestably great Streep to take impressionistic snatches of a life and build a woman in full. This is acting of the highest order.","88","1007029"
"17688","As far as shootouts go, The Killer is an over-the-top success. It's shameless in its excesses - in its filmic allusions, in its camp emotionality, in its frenzied and slo-mo sequences of bullet fire. There are shades of Martin Scorsese and Sam Peckinpah in the artfelt violence, and a direct hit on ""Duel in the Sun"" as two blinded lovers crawl to each other but miss. Throughout the absurd goings-on, director John Woo's playfulness is hard to resist, and Chow Yun-Fat as the hired killer has an appealing deadpan charisma. [28 June 1991, p.72]","88","97202"
"17689","At her best—and even in a hand-me-down project like Point Break—Bigelow is a uniquely talented, uniquely powerful filmmaker. Where the male action directors are still playing with toys-with dolls and models and matte shots-Bigelow has tapped into something primal and strong. She is a sensualist of genius in this most sensual of mediums.","88","102685"
"17690","Ron Howard has made his best movie with Frost/Nixon, an electric political drama with a skin-prickling immediacy.","88","870111"
"17691","This low-key and engrossing Belfast-based drama is as much a well-acted character study as it is a thriller about the conflict in Northern Ireland.","88","1770734"
"17692","Uusually satisfying in the way it unfolds.","88","120834"
"17693","One of the many surprising delights in the bright and brassy and wonderfully funny Thor: Ragnarok is the recasting of the God of Thunder as a perpetual underdog.","88","3501632"
"17694","Scott Pilgrim is a breathless rush of a movie that jumps off the screen, spins your head around and then stealthily works its way into your heart.","88","446029"
"17695","A beautiful film, not only in the way it was photographed, but for the manner through which the characters are revealed to us.","88","112579"
"17696","Although Precious is based on a novel, it's an act of truth-telling on behalf of a character in hellish enslavement.","88","929632"
"17697","Bouncy vocal rearrangements of pop songs, sparkling choreography and a hilarious script make for a movie that's made to be obsessed over, seen 50 times, quoted as devoutly as such sacred texts as ""Heathers"" and ""Bring It On.""","88","1981677"
"17698","This film teaches the rewards of patience for directors, for actors and for audiences, too. The compelling reality of Juliette's plight comes from how subtly and gradually she emerges from her carapace.","88","1068649"
"17699","As in the very best Anthony Mann and John Ford westerns, Looper at once understands the visual power of violence and is deeply critical of it.","88","1276104"
"17700","Raiders of the Lost Ark (at the Eglinton) is a cinematic roller-coaster, thrilling and frightening in equal measure, a heart-pounding slide down greased lightning. [12 June 1981]","88","82971"
"17701","The life of Riley is not exotic; her troubles are not unique. But they are rendered with serious imagination by Docter and company.","88","2096673"
"17702","The Neverending Story, Wolfgang Petersen's sophisticated fantasy film, is so wonderfully appropriate to children that it seems to have been made by kids. But there is enough artistic merit in the tale to enchant adults equally. [20 Jul 1984, p.1]","88","88323"
"17703","A souped-up roadster of a film, a relentless action flick that looks great and moves with more grace and speed than seems possible.","88","244244"
"17704","Sayles cannily blends drama, romance, mystery, and social observation into a satisfying, if slightly overlong, whole. In the hands of a lesser film maker, this material could easily have degenerated into routine melodrama, but Sayles keeps it on a consistently high level.","88","116905"
"17705","The most imperfect of the year's best movies, Magnolia's flaws are easily forgiven because they are the result of go-for-broke ambition.","88","175880"
"17706","A feature film as odd, personal and sometimes mundane as his (Pekar) comics.","88","305206"
"17707","Not a masterpiece, but it's an example of how imagination, craftsmanship, and technological bravura can fashion superior entertainment out of something that is far from flawless.","88","120915"
"17708","The picture is solidly crafted, performed to the hilt and full of humor.","88","120660"
"17709","This is a movie about friendship, about foolhardy endeavors that get your adrenaline going and make you feel life buzzing in your toes. Written with wit and concision and remarkable confidence, Bottle Rocket is a joyride worth taking.","88","115734"
"17710","Lee has forged a work of art in the classic sense -- art that delights and instructs.","88","97216"
"17711","The ""Godfather"" films transcended their mobster genre; New Jack City doesn't, but it's a great genre film, edgy, vibrant and full of urgent color.","88","102526"
"17712","The film is more than laborious eye-blinking - it's also dazzling visually, its potent imagery conjured by cinematographer Janusz Kaminski. But finally, Diving Bell is about something imperceptible: consciousness.","88","401383"
"17713","The irony is, this family isn't mismatched: All six bickering characters are connected by empathy as well as blood, and we wait for them to figure that out.","88","449059"
"17714","There's scarcely a scene in which the actors, action and sound track aren't cranked up to maximum intensity.","88","146838"
"17715","Rivets and amazes, even if it falls just frustratingly short of the mind-expanding grandeur it could have had.","88","407304"
"17716","Washington hasn't been this relaxed in years. When he feels like it he can be the most charismatic star in the movies.","88","454848"
"17717","A hilarious black comedy and already something of a cult favorite.","88","94336"
"17718","It's slick, sleek, and stylish, and if it doesn't quite redefine cool, it certainly offers a snazzy update.","88","240772"
"17719","It is by turns comic, dark and surprisingly tender. If one must reduce it to simple description, call it a love story with a twist. Or a twisted love story.","88","338013"
"17720","As striking as Mudbound's combat scenes are, they largely exist as setup for the postwar-set second half of the film, which scrutinizes the way that the atrocities witnessed in Europe laid bare the unsustainable hypocrisy in America's own bigoted divisions.","88","2396589"
"17721","The movie gets the job done, and the actors show a lot of confidence in occupying that tricky middle ground between controlled satire and comic overkill. It's fun.","88","480255"
"17722","It's a dark, dark comedy that ruthlessly skewers the news industry on a stake, then roasts it alive.","88","74958"
"17723","Urgent and stunning movie.","88","433383"
"17724","The Muppets may have been born out of a desire to revive a dormant franchise that was once a cash cow, but there isn't a single beat in the film that feels crass or opportunistic. This one is from the heart.","88","1204342"
"17725","The strength of Burger’s movie is the fact that a non-reader of Roth’s work can enjoy Divergent and not be confused by any aspect of the storyline.","88","1840309"
"17726","In capturing the compelling battle between a boy and his abusive stepfather, director Michael Caton-Jones cannily avoids obvious sentimentality, opting to let a rather brutal story tell itself.","88","108330"
"17727","Starts out hilarious and then turns very, very grim.","88","215545"
"17728","A rousing state-of-the-art cartoon capped by an aerial-combat climax that, to its credit, isn't anti-climactic. [2 July 1996, p.D1]","88","116629"
"17729","It’s one of the year’s sweetest films.","88","8637428"
"17730","This is no longer the James Bond we know from the '60s, '70s, '80s, and '90s. Welcome to the new world of MI6's most storied agent.","88","381061"
"17731","There is an undeniable neorealist quality to Labaki’s work, bringing to mind not only the first half of Garth Davis’ ""Lion,"" but also the likes of Vittorio De Sica’s ""Shoeshine"" and Sean Baker’s ""The Florida Project"" (even though it falls short of the artistic command of these titles).","88","8267604"
"17732","Denzel Washington is riveting.","88","115956"
"17733","Freeman and Tandy are the whole film, and their interplay is marvelous to watch and hear. [12 Jan. 1990, p.G7]","88","97239"
"17734","I greatly prefer this cleverly sustained and efficiently relentless remake to the '73 edition. It is lean and simple.","88","455407"
"17735","The film is very smart, most of all because it resists the urge to devolve into a sentimental redemption narrative. This is a daring comedy with a very sharp bite.","88","5962210"
"17736","Lately, it seems that film noir has become the province of independent productions. As a result, it's refreshing to see a big-budget, studio effort of this sort that does nearly everything right.","88","119488"
"17737","The keenly observed patterns of behavior and the witty, intimate dialogue pay off.","88","3062976"
"17738","The film is too sprawling in extent, too noisy as to background music and voices and much too obvious in the application of its social significance notes. But while it isn’t the best picture to come out of Hollywood this year, nor is it Capra’s masterpiece, it tells a good story and its conclusion has a heart-warming effect on the audience.","88","38650"
"17739","The crisply photographed and edited Body of Lies reveals some ambition, for while it certainly works as pure entertainment, this tale of a good man trying to extract himself from an impossible situation offers some commentary on America's feelings about being in Iraq.","88","758774"

"17756","A threat to the Bond franchise? Not a threat so much as a salute. I don't want James Bond to turn crude and muscular on me; I like the suave style. But I like Xander, too, especially since he seems to have studied Bond so very carefully.","88","295701"

"17758","Refusing to explain Ted Bundy is the strongest possible choice Berlinger could have made because it destabilizes reality. The film itself gaslights us, and this is where Berlinger and Zac Efron — an inspired choice—are powerful co-creators.","88","2481498"
"17759","While director Armando Iannucci's brand of satire -- just plausible enough to be painful -- isn't for all tastes, it's a little bit of heaven to hear screen characters spew such eloquently vicious bile.","88","1226774"

"17766","Huston gives one of her very best performances as a strong lady who can con almost everyone but herself. Her manner on the screen in this picture and in Woody Allen's ""Crimes and Misdemeanors'' marks Huston as the one contemporary actress who comes closest to having the power of classic female dramatic stars of years past.

"17777","The Equalizer features some gruesomely creative violence, but it’s equally memorable for the small, gritty moments set in that diner, or on the rough-and-tumble streets of Boston. And most of all, it’s got Denzel going for it.","88","455944"
"17778","Mr. Holland's Opus is a glowing tribute to the unsung heroics of those rare, gifted teachers who make a difference in life. Richard Dreyfuss, in a performance that both touches and inspires, plays music teacher Glenn Holland.","88","113862"

"17781","For all its polish, Bonfire of the Vanities neither sustains the feverish, revolutionary energy nor reaches the visceral peak of Hi, Mom! But as major Hollywood pictures go, it can become stunningly hot-tempered, a quality most journalists are too quick to ignore.","88","99165"

"17783","The movie with which it has the closest relationship may be ""Glengarry Glen Ross."" The same sense of desperation, the same need to make the sale, permeates Margin Call. Both films are to some degree about the dehumanizing impact of money and both are driven more by characters than plot points.","88","1615147"
"17784","For at least two-thirds of its length, all elements combine for a taut thriller, a Hitchcockian exercise in suspense pitting human frailty - can our minds be trusted? - against human resourcefulness.","88","408790"

"17789","While the musical numbers don’t match the impact of the originals and there’s a bit of a lull in the second act where not all that much seems to be happening, The Lion King is on balance a solid and at times stunningly beautiful film.","88","6105098"
"17790","Stone's most impressive achievement in this film is to allow all the financial wheeling and dealing to seem complicated and convincing, and yet always have it make sense.","88","94291"
"17791","A lean, spare, stylish and grimly, methodically ultra-violent extravaganza that provides star Keanu Reeves with a much-needed infusion of cool. And hard-core action fans with combat-centric cinematic expertise on a par with 20ll’s “The Raid.”","88","2911666"

"17798","There are times when a B-movie is made so carefully and performed so robustly that the audience wants it to work and goes with it, roots for it; those are the times that directors grope for, even with A-material.

"17799","This is a powerful tale of crime, guilt, and punishment -- a drama that incorporates elements of whodunit mystery/thrillers and police procedurals with a richly textured three-character play.","88","327056"
"17800","It's a sign of just how much Coppola respects her characters that she doesn't make us privy to that final line: It is only meant for them to share. But like the rest of the ethereal Lost in Translation, you don't need to have it spelled out in order to feel it.","88","335266"
"17801","A charming, if often-seen, tale, paced with alacrity by Wilder from the adaptation of Taylor's hit play. [Review of re-release]","88","47437"
"17802","Linklater ambitiously shot his new effort over a period of 12 years with the same cast, showcasing what turns out to be an astonishing performance by newcomer Ellar Coltrane, who grows up from 6 to 18 before our eyes over the course of 164 minutes.","88","1065073"
"17803","The filmmakers don't bother hammering home a backstory or explaining why David is crazy. They just throw us in the deep end and dazzle us with a series of violent encounters that ends with a deadly chase in a surreal fun house maze of mirrors.","88","2980592"
"17804","One powerful, mesmerizing thriller, a masterful exercise in controlling an audience's attention. [19 September 1986, Friday, p.A]","88","90756"

"17806","No one, but no one, makes movies like Bong, a South Korean master who combines baroque concepts, epic visuals, international casts, and a sense of humor that can make you laugh out loud in the middle of the darkest doings.","88","3967856"
"17807","The day after seeing it, you're less likely to fixate on the flaws than to find yourself experiencing chuckle aftershocks as you recall the most outrageous gags. In these days of mostly forgettable comedies, that sensation has become all too rare. [15 July 1998]","88","129387"
"17808","For some, the silver linings in Russell’s movies represent a failure to embrace darkness. I see them as a humanist’s act of resistance. That’s why American Hustle ranks with the year’s best movies. It gets under your skin.","88","1800241"

"17810","Grace is grace, and however it arrives, there's no denying its presence.","88","1028576"
"17811","Visually, the movie is a knockout. Craven-who, along with George Romero and David Cronenberg, was one of the real masters of post-'60s low-budget horror-never made a scarier picture than the original ""Nightmare."" But he's probably never made a better one than this-one that was more fun to watch or had a more satisfying conclusion, that slammed the door on hell with such panache.","88","111686"
"17812","Albert Brooks is one of the few, maybe the only, comic filmmakers making movies today with laughs that hurt. A very funny--and therefore neurotic--young man, Brooks places himself in all sorts of contemporary situations in his movies, situations that force him to whine like a baby to get what he wants. He's the filmmaker for the Baby Boom generation.","88","89504"
"17813","Adams, her face a reflection of conflicting emotions, is simply stellar in an Oscar-buzzed performance of amazing grit and grace. Without her, Arrival might be too cerebral to warm up to. With her, the film gets inside your head and emerges as something intimate and epic, a linguistics odyssey through space and time. It's the stuff that dreams are made of.","88","2543164"
"17814","McConaughey makes sure we feel his tenacity and triumphs in the treatment of AIDS. His explosive, unerring portrayal defines what makes an actor great, blazing commitment to a character and the range to make every nuance felt.","88","790636"
"17815","Giamatti's performance is one of those achievements. He is making a career of playing unremarkable but memorable men.","88","1423894"
"17816","Star Trek was never about gizmos, but about relationships - both among its crew members and with its audience. Star Trek VI more than upholds the tradition, making it a satisfying send-off for a mighty ship of foils. [6 Dec. 1991, p.1D]","88","102975"
"17817","Any culture that can create the kind of self-criticism exemplified in work of thePittsburgh horror master is far from a lost cause. [29 June 1979]","88","77402"
"17818","One of the most complex and visually interesting science fiction movies in a long time.","88","100802"
"17819","The cast is uniformly spectacular, infusing the characters with nuance and complexity.","88","878835"
"17820","Violence may provide entertainment value in more crass or commercially minded projects, but in the unflinching world of Affliction, it leads only to the ruination of your soul. [5 February 1999, Friday, p.D]","88","118564"
"17821","Succeeding where most docudramas fail, it turns a slice of recent history into a revealingly intelligent entertainment, without being didactic at one extreme or sentimental at the other.","88","436697"
"17822","A film as rich in its visual presentation as it is in its emotional resonance.","88","119314"
"17823","What Burton has made is a film which celebrates Wood more than it mocks him, and which celebrates, too, the zany spirit of 1950s exploitation films - in which a great title, a has-been star and a lurid ad campaign were enough to get bookings for some of the oddest films ever made.","88","109707"
"17824","Moving without being mawkish, charming without being coy.","88","69303"
"17825","It's a punchy, straight-up genre picture, a crime drama that might have once starred Charles Bronson or Steven Seagal.","88","399146"
"17826","If ""The Sixth Sense"" was Shyamalan's take on ghost stories and ""Unbreakable"" his ode to comic books, then Signs is the evil cousin to Steven Spielberg's ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind.""","88","286106"
"17827","Start to finish, it’s a delight.","88","787474"
"17828","Down in the mud with the guys, Moore finds the heart of her character and a career beyond vanity and hype. She's never looked better.","88","119173"
"17829","Zandvliet is a relatively young and inexperienced director, but his spare use of music and widescreen images is assured and even inspired.","88","3841424"
"17830","Psycho is a brilliant excursion into fear that pushes many of our primal buttons, but it lacks the story and character complexity of Vertigo and Rear Window.","88","54215"
"17831","It's a celebration of free expression that treats youth like a fierce and beautiful animal, and never attempts to tame it. In Pump Up the Volume, the ""why-bother"" generation finds a voice, and begins to bother. [22 Aug 1990, p.47]","88","100436"
"17832","In Ran, color plays a role not unlike that of language in ""Lear"": a kind of ground bass of beauty, a product of pure imagination, that both affirms life and surpasses it. Yet Kurosawa uses that beauty more as negation: a reminder not of what man is capable of but how puny he is in comparison.","88","89881"
"17833","With tenderness and toughness, Greengrass has made a great film about a terrible act.","88","7280898"
"17834","You can sense the difference between a movie that's a technical exercise (""Resident Evil"") and one steamed in the dread cauldrons of the filmmaker's imagination.","88","187738"
"17835","A beautifully photographed movie filled with poignancy, humor, and (of course) some superb acting.","88","82846"
"17836","A charming throwback filled with authentic characters.","88","1174730"
"17837","This film succeeds because it knows how to strike the right balance between laugh-out-loud comedy and quiet, effective drama. The clichés are there, but its heart beats loud enough for us to embrace and forgive them.","88","3385524"
"17838","Bryan Cranston finally translates his critical acclaim for “Breaking Bad” into an Oscar-caliber performance in darkly comic Trumbo, playing an eloquent, witty screenwriter who bucked the Hollywood blacklist and triumphed.","88","3203606"
"17839","The film's tone is set by a bravura opening sequence that follows a single bullet from a factory conveyer belt to its resting place in a child's skull, and by Cage's flawlessly sardonic voice-over.","88","399295"
"17840","The Greatest Showman, directed with verve and panache by Michael Gracey, is an unabashed piece of pure entertainment, punctuated by 11 memorable songs composed by Oscar- and Tony-winning duo Benj Pasek and Justin Paul.","88","1485796"
"17841","The film mixes the psychological with the supernatural, the profane with the ridiculous, the self-indulgent with the understated, and dares you to assume anything. It's all great fun.","88","309698"
"17842","Doesn't sound like a very prepossessing title, but prepare to be taken aback by ""what's in a name."" [6 July 1994, Life, p.1D]","88","109830"
"17843","The performance of the movie is Liev Schreiber as Shaw, a man howlingly uncomfortable in his own skin.","88","368008"
"17844","Likely to appeal to the fans of ""The Sixth Sense,"" ""Ghost"" and other movies where the characters find a loophole in reality. What it also has in common with those two movies is warmth and emotion.","88","186151"
"17845","What's fresh about Midnight in Paris is the way he (Allen) identifies with Gil's idealization of the past, of the Paris that represented art and life at their fullest.","88","1605783"
"17846","Together, Crystal and Ryan really click. Even though their characters are polar opposites (or perhaps because of it), their interaction has a charm and warmth that most motion picture pairings lack.","88","98635"
"17847","A unique, audacious studio movie, kicking off as a star-driven spectacle before whittling itself down to a raw and riveting character study.","88","1907668"
"17848","Vol. 2 isn't anywhere near as self-indulgent as its predecessor, but it still plays like the work of a man too in love with his creations to decide which of his darlings to kill - so he ended up with merely a very good movie.","88","378194"
"17849","The performances are uniformly strong, with Gere offering some of his best work - though it pales in comparison with Gossett's tour de force as the tough, principled Sgt. Foley.","88","84434"
"17850","From the Eastern flavor of the opening theme, hauntingly sung by Nancy Sinatra, to the Japanese setting, the fifth film is the Bond series just gets better and cooler with age. The tasty script by Roald Dahl junks most of the Fleming novel, spinning its own witty Cold War fantasy.","88","62512"
"17851","Resonates like the best of Southern fiction.","88","117666"
"17852","These films have always been about the power of words, their ability to bridge gulfs of time and space, the thrill of ideas and opinions taking definitive shape.","88","2209418"
"17853","This movie has the jaunty good cheer of another great movie about hit men, ""Prizzi's Honor."" And that is high praise indeed.","88","119229"
"17854","The Other Side of the Wind isn't a novelty item, but a work of anguished art that's worthy of its creator.","88","69049"
"17855","Gerwig, not surprisingly, is a marvel: mercurial, thin-skinned, haughty, desperate, funny, warm, a magnetic presence who mesmerizes the audience in the same way she attracts Tracy.","88","2872462"
"17856","Elegiac and yet ruefully funny, Hal Ashby’s Being There is at once a profoundly philosophical fable about how we become truly human only in the face of our ineluctable mortality, as well as an incensed satire intent on skewering the mass media’s unhealthy sway among the corridors of wealth and power.","88","78841"
"17857","Director Wolfgang Petersen puts such a fresh spin on the familiar that it all works like gangbusters.","88","118571"
"17858","Bright Star delivers a prismatic depiction - tart, funny and piercing - of the romance between poet John Keats and Fanny Brawne in the three years before he died, in 1821, at age 25.","88","810784"
"17859","Co-writers/directors Faxon and Rast have created a little gem of a film. Without question, The Way Way Back is the best coming-of-age movie of the summer and should be seen by audiences of all ages.","88","1727388"
"17860","The one movie families search for every Christmas for an outing, the way ""Something's Gotta Give"" was last year and ""Jerry Maguire"" was in 1996.","88","371246"
"17861","The coming-of-age film is poignant and comical, sitting squarely on that threshold, focusing on the time when a teen is part boy, part man and all adolescent.","88","2179116"
"17862","Baby Driver literalizes Edgar Wright’s fascination with people’s emotional overreliance on pop culture as a cover for arrested development.","88","3890160"
"17863","Super Dark Times has a deeply unnerving mood, more unnerving than ""what happens.""","88","5112578"
"17864","Thankfully, Tintin is Spielberg at his most playful and unpretentious.","88","983193"
"17865","Jingoistic politics are not proper or prudent in the pluralistic human society of the 1990s. It's much easier to assuage these baser urges by facing a real nonhuman enemy that just wants to kill you. War is gore. You or them. That message is the real strength of ""Starship Troopers,"" although many may find it morally flawed. No matter, this is powerful entertainment that appeals to our most basic instincts.","88","120201"
"17866","If you've been seduced by Andrew Lloyd Webber's stage version of ""The Phantom of the Opera,"" you'll fall in love with the gorgeous, splendidly cast film.","88","293508"
"17867","What is best about A Mighty Heart is that it doesn't reduce the Daniel Pearl story to a plot, but elevates it to a tragedy. A tragedy that illuminates and grieves for the hatred that runs loose in our world, hatred as a mad dog that attacks everyone. Attacks them for what seems, to the dog, the best of reasons.","88","829459"
"17868","The movie's an unexpected end-of-summer tonic: a trash guilty pleasure with a healthy (if really violent) sense of outrage. It's also Rodriguez's freest movie yet, and possibly his best.","88","985694"
"17869","Like ""The Notebook,"" but with an elephant, the unexpectedly good film version of Water for Elephants elevates pure corn to a completely satisfying realm of romantic melodrama.","88","1067583"
"17870","Ingrid Bergman makes a charming and beautiful refugee and Paul Henried gives a convincing performance in the role of the ardent anti-Nazi leader. Claude Rains gives one of his best performances as the police chief and Conrad Veidt is properly menacing as the Nazi officer. Sydney Greestreet is wonderful as the slick proprietor of the Blue Parrot and Rick’s rival in the cafe business.","88","34583"
"17871","It's a powerhouse, demanding film that sometimes stretches the limits of credibility. But it's done with such consistent technical brilliance--and with such a first-rate cast and company.","88","449467"
"17872","Peele is this generation’s Hitchcock, for sure, but also a true American original with introspective themes in hand and suspense to spare.","88","6857112"
"17873","Like its heroine, the film's glib - and sometimes sidesplittingly funny - patter at first diverts viewers from its poignant insights. Happily, as Juno grows in experience and maturity, so does the film.","88","467406"
"17874","The experience is frightening, sometimes disgusting, and (if the truth be told) exhilarating. This is very skillful filmmaking, and Mad Max 2 is a movie like no other.","88","82694"
"17875","It's a snapshot of a small Texas town in the 1950s that's ostensibly filled with bighearted, god-fearing real Americans. But this exceedingly sad film spits in the eye of such homespun niceties: This is an Eisenhower-era world riddled with directionless teens, bored housewives and disenfranchised citizens who can't escape the futility around them.","88","67328"
"17876","The excruciating and the hilarious mingle nearly to perfection in this marvelously visualized and deeply felt British film.","88","1440292"
"17877","The Brothers Bloom has it all: charming romance, jaunty adventure story, witty dialogue, gorgeous cinematography and superb performances.","88","844286"
"17878","War Horse is bold, not afraid of sentiment and lets out all the stops in magnificently staged action sequences. Its characters are clearly defined and strongly played by charismatic actors. Its message is a universal one.","88","1568911"
"17879","Brad’s Status might be the most Ben Stillerish movie Ben Stiller has ever made, and that’s actually a good thing.","88","5884230"
"17880","Writers Barry Berman and Leslie McNeil and director Jeremiah Chechik tell the story with tenderness and humor. And - miracle of miracles, in this day of endless endings - when the story is over, the movie is over, too. [16 Apr 1993, p.3G]","88","106387"
"17881","Tamara Drewe is one of those British comedies in which, one way or another, we envy all of the characters.","88","1486190"
"17882","“Moonlight” is a hard act to follow, and while Beale Street might not quite reach the heights of Jenkins’ instant classic of a best picture-winner, it is its own kind of marvel, lovely, transcendent, heartbreaking and as smooth as its jazzy soundtrack.","88","7125860"
"17883","The real deal, an often awkward but nonetheless terrifically compelling high-stakes human drama.","88","121766"
"17884","What a thoughtful film this is, and how thought-stirring. Marc Forster's Stranger Than Fiction comes advertised as a romance, a comedy, a fantasy, and it is a little of all three, but it's really a fable, a ""moral tale.""","88","420223"
"17885","As much as Eastwood finds to condemn in the movie’s designated villains, he does not deliver any comeuppances to them in the end. Which is merciful in the context of fiction, and kind of the mordant point in the context of fact.","88","3513548"
"17886","This film has two of Fincher's happiest trademarks: It's full of information and stretches over a remarkably long time (165 minutes), yet it's neither confusing nor overextended.","88","1568346"
"17887","The year's best man is a lady. [17 Dec 1982]","88","84805"
"17888","Winter's Bone is unforgettable. It means to shake you, and does.","88","1399683"
"17889","One of the most obvious problems with The Godfather Part III is that it covers little new territory. The plot is highly derivative of the original.","88","99674"
"17890","The Great Escape is that rare war film that doesn’t fully indulge in assumed nationalism, save for the fact that everyone speaks English. Sturges never touches on the essential hollowness and cruel pageantry of war, but he does the next best thing by depicting an international effort where victory, no matter how short-lived, depends on the cooperation of myriad talents, rather than the gruff can-do attitude of an unbreakable chosen one.","88","57115"
"17891","Splendidly spectacular, intelligent and very well-acted.","88","240510"
"17892","Is this a family film? No way. Does it include scenes that some may find painful to watch? You bet. Will you be entertained? Thoroughly.","88","3799694"
"17893","The White Ribbon is one of the finest films that ever repelled me, a holiday in the abyss.","88","1149362"
"17894","One of the most original, good-hearted comedies in a long time, Rushmore is the sort of movie where the strangest sequences of discords somehow keep managing to reach giddily improbable resolutions.","88","128445"
"17895","Sonnenfeld moves things along with alacrity and panache, serving up the exotic visuals quietly, blending in the sprightly humour efficiently, and keeping the mix at a rolling boil.","88","119654"
"17896","It's a thinking person's thriller, where pyrotechnics give way to plot, character development supplants fight scenes, and adrenaline does not short-circuit intelligence.","88","133952"
"17897","Though the comedy is sometimes more frenetic than inspired and viewer emotions are rarely touched to any notable degree, the movie is as visually inventive as its Pixar predecessors.","88","198781"
"17898","One of those rare movies that's not only based on a comic book, but also feels like a comic book. It's vibrating with energy, and you can sense the zeal and joy in its making.","88","167190"
"17899","A riveting remake of a pretty terrific 1957 western about manhood, fatherhood and honor.","88","381849"
"17900","The performances and Greengrass’s way with action immerse us and make Captain Phillips a tight, taut,edge of your seat thriller even if you remember the ending.","88","1535109"
"17901","For now, The Two Towers feels like the second installment in what next year, when Frodo finally reaches Mount Doom and the story draws to a close, we'll surely be hailing as a masterpiece.","88","167261"
"17902","The best teenage comedy since last year's ""Risky Business.""","88","88128"
"17903","Like the book, the movie blends a primitive quality with an imaginative artfulness. It also amplifies upon the story's gentle, sly wit.","88","386117"
"17904","A 2-hour classic wrongfully stretched into three.","88","112641"
"17905","Jurassic World is pure, dumb, wall-to-wall fun. When they hand you your 3-D glasses, you can check your brain at the door and pick it up on your way out.","88","369610"
"17906","This is the funniest teen movie I've seen in eons.","88","91042"
"17907","It's the actor/director's best movie - and the best Western by anybody in over 20 years. [7 Aug 1992]","88","105695"
"17908","Lethal Weapon sinks an unexpectedly sharp hook at a delightfully unique angle, and never once lets up. A purposefully off- kilter flick, it fakes one way and moves another, thwarting our conditioned responses and fuelling our happy surprise. [6 Mar 1987, p.D1]","88","93409"
"17909","Sometimes, it's exciting to watch a movie formula jell on screen-and that's what you can see happening in The Client, the latest, and best, of three successive films adapted from legal thrillers by John Grisham.","88","109446"
"17910","It's those moments and others and the way they are tied together by Shepherd's tongue-in-cheek narration that cements A Christmas Story as one of those rare must-see holiday movies, even for those who don't celebrate Christmas.","88","85334"
"17911","Unlikely as it seems, considering the source, Hope and Glory may be John Boorman's most affecting film. It is surely his most entertaining. [27 Nov 1987, p.D1]","88","93209"
"17912","Although Big is generally lighthearted, it rarely plays for stupid laughs. There are a few of these, but the film avoids sacrificing character integrity for the cheap guffaw.","88","94737"
"17913","In a development that seemed to begin in earnest with ""Sideways,"" a large part of The Descendents seems to operate on a non-narrative level.","88","1033575"
"17914","Hanks has a good time, romping around with the assurance of a holy fool. He and Roberts seem ""actorish,"" putting on accents and mannerisms, but they're entertaining. Hoffman is something more, a scenery-devouring force of nature irresistible as a cyclone and irreverent as a stand-up comedian at a midnight show.","88","472062"
"17915","It's a tough entry into the tough black-comic genre; don't be surprised if it becomes a classic. [31 March 1989]","88","97493"
"17916","Parts of Ruby Sparks are glowing and gentle. Others are harsh. Still others are wrenching. The transitions are expertly handled, never seeming jarring or inappropriate. If the movie feels like two shorter pieces grafted at the middle, that's an intentional decision. The filmmakers give us something approaching a traditional romantic comedy before deconstructing it.","88","1839492"
"17917","The film shines at capturing the watercolor delicacy of China's past.","88","120762"
"17918","For 20 years the news has reported from time to time of crimes alleged by employees of paid defense contractors. These cases rarely seem to result in change, and the stories continue. We can only guess what may be going unreported. The Whistleblower offers chilling evidence of why that seems to be so.","88","896872"
"17919","There isn't much depth to The Fugitive, but you'll never know it (or care). In addition to a spectacular train/bus smashup and an exciting sewer chase, there's one of the funniest public confrontations since Cary Grant broke up the art auction in North by Northwest. Result: Warner Bros. has what it had last August with Unforgiven - a commercial movie with real class. [6 Aug 1993, p.1D]","88","106977"
"17920","By turning a whistle-blower into a tragicomic figure, Soderbergh sustains our interest in a complicated financial scheme and rewards it with a kickback of ghastly laughs.","88","1130080"
"17921","If this works at all it’s because of the sound design: the cacophony of squawks and flapping over the opening credits, followed by incessant tapping, screeching, chirping, fluttering – sometimes in scenes where no birds are present. And then the occasional shock of silence, which is eerier still.","88","56869"
"17922","Wake up, people. Tarantino lives to cross the line. Is Django Unchained too much? Damn straight. It wouldn't be Tarantino otherwise.","88","1853728"
"17923","Everything in the movie is excessive, and if you have no taste forflamboyant or violent genre pieces, you may find much of it--and especiallythe amazingly protracted climax--a little ridiculous. But what's fascinatingabout ""Strange Days"" is both its sheer kinetic energy, the vitality of theactors and the density and detail of its crazy little world. [13 Oct 1995, p.C2]","88","114558"
"17924","It is not an entirely successful movie, but it is new and fresh and not shy of taking chances. And the dialogue in it is actually worth listening to, because it is written with wit and romance.","88","99892"
"17925","Sally Hawkins is the heart and soul of Made in Dagenham, but another actress to watch for is the equally wonderful Rosamund Pike. She steals every scene she's in as the sympathetic wife of Rita's sexist boss (Rupert Graves).","88","1371155"
"17926","Nothing if not a celebration of our willingness to be gulled by life's charming strangers.","88","264464"
"17927","28 Weeks Later has a stronger story line, equally fine performances, greater tension, enough gore to satisfy the most hard-core zombie fan, and a narrative pace that flings us from the opening scenes to the very last image.","88","463854"
"17928","Clooney, who gained 35 pounds for the role, gives a self-effacing but highly effective performance.","88","365737"
"17929","There’s something of the harlequin in Leigh’s conception of this bright, manic young woman.","88","1045670"
"17930","It could be argued that this movie's callousness toward human life is nihilistic and nasty. But Woo takes everything so absurdly far that audiences laugh at what horrified them moments before. [27Jun1997 Pg01.D]","88","119094"
"17931","Just see it. This movie will take a piece out of you.","88","1866249"
"17932","There is no mechanical plot that has to grind to a Hollywood conclusion, and no contrived test for the heroes to pass; this is a movie about two particular young men, and how they pass their lives.","88","102494"
"17933","Skyscraper doesn’t change the action-movie game the way “Die Hard” did, but it’s a solidly entertaining summer diversion best enjoyed on the biggest theater — or even better, drive-in — screen you can find. And if you’re afraid of heights, make sure there’s an armrest — or even better, an arm — that you can grab.","88","5758778"
"17934","One of those rare animated movies that transports you to a different setting without demanding that you focus on narrative or character development.","88","3666024"
"17935","Abrams understands what George Lucas never quite figured out: that we’re less interested in the science fiction future than we are in revisiting the past. We don’t really want to see what happens next in that galaxy far, far away. We want to recapture what it felt like the first time we arrived, in 1977, with a movie called “Star Wars.” We want to go home. Star Wars: The Force Awakens takes us there.","88","2488496"
"17936","This movie is more sophisticated and complicated than the Westerns of my childhood, and it is certainly better looking and better acted.","88","90022"
"17937","The New York art world quickly makes Basquiat a star. His work is good (when you see it in the movie, you can feel why people liked it so much), but his story is better: from a cardboard box to a gallery opening!","88","115632"
"17938","Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams give two of the most explosive and emotionally naked performances you will see anywhere. Just know you're in for a workout.","88","1120985"
"17939","The Guard is a pleasure. I can't tell if it's really (bleeping) dumb or really (bleeping) smart, but it's pretty (bleeping) good.","88","1540133"
"17940","Gary Oldman is one of the greatest actors on the planet – and he proves it again as Winston Churchill in Darkest Hour.","88","4555426"
"17941","It's instructive to note what a killer actor Richard Gere can be when a movie rises to his level. Arbitrage is such a movie, a sinfully entertaining look at the sins committed in the name of money.","88","1764183"
"17942","A raucous ride through one man's pain.","88","800039"
"17943","Beyond the visuals, what makes The Maze Runner so compelling is its attention-grabbing storyline.","88","1790864"
"17944","Hilarious sweet and sour David Mamet comedy.","88","120202"
"17945","You still get Tim Curry in drag, young Susan Sarandon in her skimpies and an enthusiastic score. [16 Nov 1990, p.3D]","88","73629"
"17946","The movie is astonishingly foul-mouthed, but in a fluent, confident way where the point isn't the dirty words, but the flow and rhythm, and the deep, sad yearning they represent.","88","829482"
"17947","The beginning is a little slow, but after Neeson starts his hunt and does his best wrath-of-God impression, it doesn’t skip a beat.","88","936501"
"17948","The maturity of the Star Trek saga and its remarkable fan base have combined to produce a polished film that shines like a crown jewel in the Star Trek firmament.","88","120844"
"17949","One of the pleasures of Beginners is the warmth and sincerity of the major characters. There is no villain. They begin by wanting to be happier and end by succeeding.","88","1532503"
"17950","DiCaprio may well receive a Best Actor Oscar for his tour de force as the conflicted FBI director -- greatly abetted by Hammer (who played the Winklevoss twins in ""The Social Network'') in his first major role as the flamboyant but frustrated Tolson.","88","1616195"
"17951","Ginnifer Goodwin gives a standout performance--and that’s saying a lot considering the large cast--as the insecure, neurotic female looking for love.","88","1001508"
"17952","The definitive zombie picture.","88","63350"
"17953","Megamind has presentation in spades. But it also has something even rarer than that. It's got heart.","88","1001526"
"17954","Miles Ahead is a film of ugly, bold bravado.","88","790770"
"17955","In D.J. Caruso's Two for the Money, you can see Al Pacino doing something he's done a lot lately: Having a terrific time being an actor.","88","417217"
"17956","Altered States is a superbly silly movie, a magnificent entertainment, and a clever and brilliant machine for making us feel awe, fear, and humor.","88","80360"
"17957","A wonderful film, nostalgia not for a time but for a style of filmmaking, when shell-shocked young audiences were told a story and not pounded over the head with aggressive action.","88","1650062"
"17958","I'm giving the movie a high rating for its skill and professionalism and because it does the job it says it will do. I am also advising you not to eat before you go to see it.","88","90605"
"17959","Easily the best non-Disney animated movie in recent memory, and it is good enough to rival such titles as “The Lion King” and “Aladdin.”","88","118617"
"17960","It was never going to be “Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.” Reserve that honor for the film that inspired it. But Saving Mr. Banks is still one of the best pictures of the year.","88","2140373"
"17961","A clever, ingeniously animated film filled with many shining moments.","88","382932"
"17962","Shot through with grit and grace, Novitiate is a potent provocation. It's also something special.","88","4513316"
"17963","Entertaining, thrilling and honestly sentimental, it's an equal-opportunity crowd-pleaser.","88","327137"
"17964","When Black Panther works, it’s thrillingly alive, whether it’s the dazzling colors of the vivid costumes by Ruth E. Carter (“Selma”)...or the eclectic and vibrant music choices.","88","1825683"
"17965","The ex-lovers' new conversation is stimulating and banal, selfish and broad-minded, affectionate and recriminatory, insightful and obtuse - in short, the kind of dialogue two people might have while pouring out their hearts and poring over their pasts.","88","381681"
"17966","One of the best of its streamlined, over-produced, double-clutch kind: a high-speed, slicker-than-slick car-chase movie with unexpected deposits of character and comedy.","88","187078"
"17967","This is one cinematic novella that stays with you for quite a while.","88","367089"
"17968","Seeing the splendid new version of Pride & Prejudice can be hazardous to your health: There's a very real danger of swooning.","88","414387"
"17969","The ironic use of every seventies psychological cliche in anunapologetic, unabashed B-movie elevates The Howling to irresistiblesilliness. Written and directed by Joe Dante, who comes to us straightfrom the horror-movie forge of Roger Corman, The Howling pays enthusiasticscenic homage to B-movies while remaining faithful to the exploitationformula of the genre. [15 May 1981]","88","82533"
"17970","It's a powerhouse of claustrophobic suspense and fierce emotion, mostly because Tom Hardy, best known as Bane in ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" is a blazing wonder as Locke.","88","2692904"
"17971","Griffith gives the fullest performance of her career; Weaver, the most likable, even though she's the villain of the piece. Michael Nichols directs his best film in years. [23 Dec 1988, Friday, p.A]","88","96463"
"17972","Yes, The King's Speech is a lively burst of populist rhetoric, superbly performed and guaranteed to please even discriminating crowds.","88","1504320"
"17973","A movie that is easily likable.","88","181875"
"17974","Whedon wants to make a Serenity trilogy, and I suspect the actors will grow on me if he does. In this case, familiarity would breed not contempt but comfort.","88","379786"
"17975","The Lobster, with a score that samples everyone from Beethoven to Nick Cave, comes at you with images that burn and laughs that stick in the throat. Take the challenge of this movie — it'll keep you up nights.","88","3464902"
"17976","When Pfeiffer is good, she's great. And when she plays bad, she's even better. [13 Oct 1989, p.G4]","88","97322"
"17977","In its amiable, quiet, PG-13 way, The Invention of Lying is a remarkably radical comedy.","88","1058017"
"17978","Hustlers is empathetic and understanding in the way it looks at sex workers as also single moms and women just trying to get by in a world where the rich seemingly only get richer. It also works as an enjoyable, empowering extravaganza of physical humor, clever script writing, exquisite fashion and scantily clad underdogs.","88","5503686"
"17979","Winslet (Mendes' wife) once again demonstrates why she's one of the best actresses working today.","88","959337"
"17980","Polanski’s direction is smooth and the film itself happily understated. The tension created is practically unbearable.","88","63522"
"17981","If the Marvel superhero movies on the whole are your favorite band’s individual albums, Avengers: Endgame is the triple-disc greatest-hits package with the really awesome cover and a slew of familiar, comforting gems inside.","88","4154796"
"17982","Be warned: Though it's entirely justified by the story, there's a level of violence and brutality in Training Day -- that some terror-weary audience members may not care to cope with these days.","88","139654"
"17983","The gamble of casting Misses Tomlin and Fonda in what would seem to be the wrong roles (Violet is the strong, efficient, hard-edged secretary; Judy the frilly, ""feminine,"" inexperienced employee) pays off handsomely, especially with Miss Tomlin. When she is handed a memo by a senior secretary and smilingly snarls, ""Thanks, Roz, I know just where to stick it,"" her line reading is worth the price of admission. The pneumatic Miss Parton sings the theme song with greater confidence than she brings to her acting: she is a sweet little thing, but she's no thespian. [20 Dec 1980]","88","80319"
"17984","An affectionate, often clever and unflaggingly funny satire.","88","177789"
"17985","As with her best films, Coppola is utterly at ease in this milieu and it shows.","88","2132285"
"17986","This is DeLillo's first produced screenplay, but he has written for the stage, and perhaps his portrait of Steven Schwimmer (Robert Downey Jr.), the detested critic, is drawn from life.","88","425055"
"17987","A potent environmental message wrapped up in an irresistibly cute romance between robots.","88","910970"
"17988","This is the rare screwball comedy that is superbly paced, cleverly plotted and hilarious from start to finish.","88","1279935"
"17989","The stunning set pieces take full advantage of animation’s unique mastery over time and space, so that we don’t just watch the characters’ daredevil exploits – we’re spinning and whirling right along with them. It’s as if we’ve mastered space and time ourselves.","88","441773"
"17990","Unlike many action-flick heroes, Snake Plissken is more than welcome the second time around. [09 Aug 1996, p.5E]","88","116225"
"17991","Its brazen mixture of the comic and dramatic, the high and low and the emotional and intellectual is positively Shakespearean.","88","138097"
"17992","The worst thing you can say about the brilliantly zany teen comedy Booksmart is that you get only an hour and 45 minutes with its quirky student body.","88","1489887"
"17993","No, the film may not be quite as luminous as the cast, but it's good - very good, in fact.","88","113277"
"17994","One of the year's most thought-provoking, hard-hitting films, gutsily opening up a subject rarely done with this kind of all-out chutzpah.","88","247199"
"17995","This is just sheer, escapist entertainment from start to finish.","88","2381941"
"17996","American Animals is a tense, taut sober and occasionally silly thriller that reminds us that the Caribbean Island at the end of the Hollywood heist is always a mirage.","88","6212478"
"17997","A thoroughly enjoyable Raiders of the Lost Ark inspired adventure film, set in the present and starring Michael Douglas as an American hustler in Columbia who helps uptight romance novelist Kathleen Turner search for buried treasure. [22 June 1984, p.12]","88","88011"
"17998","A uniquely American comedy, Greta Gerwig's Lady Bird is testy, humane, and firmly rooted in its time and place.","88","4925292"
"17999","Coppola, with his bravura style of direction, has created a movie of harrowing intensity and staggering power. But if you accept the belief that art should enlighten and illuminate as well as arouse the emotions, I’m afraid that Apocalypse Now does not qualify as great art.","88","78788"
"18000","Avoids all sports movie cliches, even the obligatory ending where the team comes from behind.","88","1226271"
"18001","Nothing can take away from the strength of Gable and Colbert's performances, the illusion of romance in their interaction, and Capra's deftness in crafting this kind of feel-good narrative. The screwball comedy elements work as effectively as the love story, which is a rarity for romantic comedies.","88","25316"
"18002","The longer film makes Donnie's intentions clearer, explains the time-travel theme better and also leaves us in no doubt as to Frank's identity.","88","246578"
"18003","Possesses the rare ability to make an audience laugh (and laugh hard) and cry, without ever seeming manipulative or going hopelessly over-the-top.","88","109831"

"18005","The Little Mermaid is more than Disney Lite, as so many of the studio's animations of the last couple of decades have been. It offers a strong link to the classic Disney tradition while generating freshly hatched delights. And it puts Disney back in the animation game in a big way. [17 Nov 1989, p.85p]","88","97757"
"18006","Garfield melts into his Doss character in a performance that seems impossibly still and tranquil. He’s mesmerizing. It’s almost impossible to imagine he ever played Spider-Man.","88","2119532"
"18007","Marshall deserves credit for knowing how to shoot and cut (alongside editor Wyatt Smith, “Thor: The Dark World”) a musical number, and his work here ranks much closer to his success with “Chicago” than to his dismal “Nine.”","88","2180411"
"18008","A funnier, faster, altogether more energetic film than Star Trek I, The Wrath of Khan doesn't linger over its modest special effects. This is really down-home week with Captain - now Admiral - Kirk and the boys. [5 June 1982]","88","84726"

"18011","Spielberg's must-see is so wondrous at depicting things that go crunch in the night that its human characterizations and pokey exposition seem astonishingly halfhearted… On a ""people"" level, Park isn't “Jaws,” but on a jolt level - oh, yes, it is. [11 June 1993, Life, p.1D]","88","107290"
"18012","Each conversation has at least one memorable line, and it's always delivered in such a casual manner that it blends right in.","88","114478"
"18013","Gerwig mostly plays it safe with this adaptation but a stellar cast and her impressive directorial eye mean that it's a total joy to watch.","88","3281548"
"18014","Just a few barrels short of being a masterpiece.","88","469494"
"18015","It is an immensely skillful sci-fi adventure, combining the usual elements: heroes and villains, special effects and stunts, chases and explosions, romance and oratory.","88","234215"
"18016","News is right, completely right, until it slips just a bit at the end.By that time it hardly matters because you've seen the best of the holiday films, as well as the most all-around entertaining movie of 1987 - a bittersweet media comedy-drama that surpasses its potential. [16 Dec 1987, p.1D]","88","92699"
"18017","A big, bold movie that gets at undeniable truths about the way no one, no matter how powerful, is immune from manipulation.","88","140352"
"18018","What really matters is that the film works. It's a genuinely suspenseful, no-holds-barred masterpiece of sex 'n' horror exploitation.","88","464154"
"18019","Jolie has an army of craftsmen in her corner, notably camera poet Roger Deakins (No Country for Old Men). But it's her vision that gives Unbroken a spirit that soars. In honoring Louis' endurance, she does herself proud.","88","1809398"
"18020","The result is a mesmerizing thriller, a movie that asks questions with no good answers and traps us within its terrifying and bizarre situation with little hope for a happy ending. With uniformly great performances throughout the cast and Lanthimos’ stunning eye for detail and composition, this is one of the most unforgettable films of the year.","88","5715874"
"18021","Chemistry is king. It's one reason the rom-com has long seemed like the toughest code for Hollywood to crack. But never underestimate the power of snappy, rapid-fire banter, the paving stones of the Hollywood road to romance.","88","1632708"
"18022","There is enough mirthful good will generated to justify even another sequel. May we suggest: ""License to Shag,"" ""You Only Shag Twice"" or ""Thundershag.""","88","145660"
"18023","The movie seems to be a fairly accurate re-creation of the making of a film at Pinewood Studios at that time. It hardly matters. What happens during the famous week hardly matters. What matters is the performance by Michelle Williams.","88","1655420"
"18024","In this haunting portrait of America as no country for old men or young, Hillcoat -- through the artistry of Mortensen and Smit-McPhee -- carries the fire of our shared humanity and lets it burn bright and true.","88","898367"
"18025","With Hammett's dialogue incorporated virtually verbatim into the screenplay, Bogart in top form, and Huston allowed total directorial freedom, watching this first of the films noir is an experience to be embraced.","88","33870"
"18026","A first-class thriller that will strike a terrifying note with anyone who's ever met the roommate from hell. [12 Aug 1992]","88","105414"
"18027","This truly IS must-see cinema — one of the most visually striking films you’ll ever see, featuring magnificent performances from the two leads.","88","7984734"
"18028","""The Sixth Sense"" was no fluke. Unbreakable, writer-director M. Night Shyamalan's dazzling reunion with Bruce Willis confirms he's one of the most brilliant filmmakers working today.","88","217869"
"18029","The movie putters near the end, but it's a film lover's delight.","88","913425"
"18030","With Rebecca, he (Hitchcock) illustrates an aptitude for crafting not only psychological terror but drama and romance.","88","32976"
"18031","Me and Earl and the Dying Girl isn’t deep. But this sure-to-be-a-crowd-pleasing laugher/weeper reminds us that there’s nothing wrong with a romantic comedy that reaches for inspiring and cathartic between the laughs.","88","2582496"
"18032","Never mind the gorgeous wilderness backdrop, the 18th-Century details, the carefully voiced and subtitled American Indian dialogue. From its very first frame until seconds before closing credits, ""Mohicans"" is an action movie. [25 Sep 1992]","88","104691"
"18033","The story has been filmed many times, but never with this kind of erotic charge. Knightley is glorious, her eyes blazing with a carnal yearning that can turn vindictive at any perceived slight.","88","1781769"
"18034","This is the first time, though, his (Mortensen)performance seemed so much bigger than the film surrounding it. That he manages the feat with so few wasted gestures puts him in line with the greats.","88","765443"
"18035","Brick is Bogart goes to high school, in other words, but that thumbnail description doesn't begin to convey the lasting pleasures of Rian Johnson's directorial debut.","88","393109"
"18036","The opening 15 minutes of Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World are so well crafted that they restore your faith in commercial cinema.","88","311113"
"18037","Sharply written, superbly acted, funny and even occasionally touching.","88","780536"
"18038","Aquaman is as concerned with scientific accuracy as “SpongeBob Squarepants.” And that’s one of many reasons why I like it.","88","1477834"
"18039","Scorsese and Schrader have made a courageous film that people of all religions or no religion should be able to watch with identical fascination. [10 Aug 1988. pg. C.4]","88","95497"
"18040","This is a remarkably assured movie, through and through. Walsh and cinematographer Guy Godfree have taken care to make every individual shot a thing of beauty. But the artfulness always acts in service of the emotions, which in the end become both inspiring and heartbreaking.","88","3721954"
"18041","Strangers on a Train is also simply a great thriller, yet another illustration of Hitchcock’s awe-inspiring ability to convey more with a single image than most directors can with minutes upon minutes of belabored set pieces.","88","44079"
"18042","Renner, in one of his best roles, lends a weathered depth to Cory but also surprising intelligence to the character deemed “Sherlock Snow.”","88","5362988"
"18043","Its provocations can seem savage at a glance, but they emerge from an observational tranquility that is uniquely Frederick Wiseman’s own.","88","12094720"
"18044","Though the film's downbeat ending was softened for U.S. release, it's still a long way from happy.","88","435625"
"18045","From the direction to the script to the production elements to the performances, Triple Frontier is a first-class ride.","88","1488606"
"18046","From Russia with Love is among the most tightly-plotted of all the Bond films, and, as a result, is one of the shortest. It moves briskly, blending intrigue, romance, and action into an immensely satisfying whole.","88","57076"
"18047","Moneyball is a thinking person's baseball movie, and a baseball fan's thinking movie.","88","1210166"
"18048","From beginning to end, Jarmusch carries it off. His vision is stranger than paradise, and his talent is odder than hell. [16 Nov 1984]","88","88184"
"18049","The movie has an organic intelligence and a sense that it, too, exists outside of linear time. It seems to be creating itself as you watch it.","88","1631867"
"18050","All of the actors play without winks and spins, unless you consider Lebowskism itself a wink and spin.","88","1234548"
"18051","It's one of the most ferociously convincing physical re-creations of warfare ever put on screen.","88","265086"
"18052","The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is as enduring a classic as has ever come out of Hollywood, and arguably among the greatest, but the film is admittedly not without its share of rough spots.","88","40897"
"18053","Baz Luhrmann’s The Great Gatsby is the first must-see film of Hollywood’s summer season, if for no other reason than its jaw-dropping evocation of Roaring ’20s New York — in 3-D, no less.","88","1343092"
"18054","Tenet is not so much a decipherable thriller as it is an extreme exercise in reverse-engineered narrative incomprehensibility – the cinematic equivalent of a half-baked pretzel, its goopy symmetrical loops superficial yet delicious all the same.","88","6723592"
"18055","An ingenious thriller that comes billed as science fiction, although its science is preposterous.","88","945513"
"18056","Though the narrative is a conventional one, the well-acted, suspenseful story deals in fascinatingly murky morality and mines intriguing material from a historic and complex city.","88","840361"
"18057","It all comes back to the heart of the Spidey story, the old adage that ""with great power comes great responsibility."" It's tough doing the right thing, and sometimes it's thankless and can come with a lot of pain, but it's still the right thing, and that's why you do it. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse always comes out swinging.","89","4633694"
"18058","Maggie’s Plan is an ensemble piece, with Maya Rudolph, Travis Fimmel, and a magic, romantic New York rounding out the cast. They’re all great, but it’s Gerwig who’s just so damn gosh-wow.","89","3471098"
"18059","I laughed more (sincerely, full-throatedly) at Toy Story 3’s smart comedy than at any other film of the still-young summer movie slate.","89","435761"
"18060","Anderson has the ability to control our emotions just as expertly as his camera.","89","1748122"
"18061","One of the most original movies of the year.","89","4353250"
"18062","Guillermo del Toro’s engrossing fairy tale The Shape of Water offers so much to be enamored of in terms of performance, execution and design that it’s disappointing when its story veers into formula.","89","5580390"
"18063","Visually inventive and offering up a complex view of family interaction, Kubo and the Two Strings is another feather in the cap for Laika, and a marvel to behold.","89","4302938"
"18064","A spare, discomfiting score and uniformly excellent performances, and you have a quiet little masterpiece of dark and chilling beauty.","89","230600"
"18065","Let Me In is by far one of the best-looking films of the year, genre or no genre. It's a nightmare, sure, but what childhood isn't?","89","1228987"
"18066","This drama-horror hybrid, set within a New York ballet company, strikes a tone more along the lines of the terrifying hallucinatories of Aronofsky's breakout film, ""Requiem for a Dream,"" revisiting, too, favorite themes of monster mommies and female hysteria.","89","947798"
"18067","Brooks’ early reputation as a film director rests with the success of this raunchy Western spoof. A great cast is eclipsed by the hilarious performances of Korman and Kahn, who plays a Marlene Dietrich-like chanteuse.","89","71230"
"18068","Despite my lack of Austen education, I found the film to be thoroughly engaging and surprisingly touching, so I can only imagine how pleased a true Austen-ite may be with Emma.","89","116191"
"18069","Love means being helpmates throughout all of life's stages. Death is part of love's bargain, and Haneke lays this fact bare.","89","1602620"
"18070","Thrilling, a grand cinematic adventure -- beautifully handled myth-making from Gibson, who, by the way, is just fine in the lead.","89","112573"
"18071","The movie's ending at the train station and the modern-day epilogue feel protracted and indulgent...Apart from the ending though, this is Spielberg's most articulate movie ever.","89","108052"
"18072","A riveting piece of cinema, successfully utilizing all the things that screenwriters are supposed to avoid: voiceovers, direct address, unreliable narrators. It also looks gorgeous, thanks to cinematographer Nicolas Karakatsanis and production designer Jade Healy.","89","5580036"
"18073","One wishes for a chewier whodunit – there just aren't enough clues for the viewer to work with – and the reveal of the mole is perversely anticlimactic. But maybe that's just stickling. We always knew Smiley'd get his man.","89","1340800"
"18074","Moon doesn't belabor anything, really, so confidently measured and philosophically nuanced it all plays out (aided by a striking, under-the-skin original score by Clint Mansell).","89","1182345"
"18075","This movie presented a radical melange of genuine horror and self-aware comic touches, not to mention the fabulous Rick Baker special effects.","89","82010"
"18076","Like Spencer Tracy, Gene Hackman, and others who have made acting on the big screen seem so easy while taking us on a journey that is far from simple, Clooney is the real thing.","89","465538"
"18077","Spotlight is a great newspaper movie, ranking up there with ""All the President’s Men"" and ""Citizen Kane"", and it’s certainly the best of its kind since ""The Paper"" in 1994, which also happened to star Michael Keaton.","89","1895587"
"18078","Doesn’t provide any answers, and that’s both its strength and weakness.","89","340855"
"18079","This movie is delightful – funny and dreamy and sometimes desperately sad.","89","4385888"
"18080","A big generational saga that woos the audience with its humor, spirit, style, and ability. Genius here is an evolutionary thing.","89","265666"
"18081","Watching and listening to these two is a charming experience; their conversation has the ring of veracity, and rarely does the viewer's interest stray.","89","112471"
"18082","Snap! That’s the crack of people teetering on the verge in each of the six segments in the perversely entertaining Argentinian film Wild Tales, a more-than-deserving recent Oscar nominee for Best Foreign Language film.","89","3011894"
"18083","An ingenious, incredibly entertaining, Rorschach-blot meta-comedy based on a spec script (by first-timer Charlie Kaufman) that is completely unlike anything anyone has ever seen before.","89","120601"
"18084","Drawn from the true adventures of the Washington Post reporters and their illustrious editor Ben Bradlee, the movie heroically recounts the dogged journalistic sleuthing that cracked the story of the Watergate break-in and cover-up.","89","74119"
"18085","Casting is everything, and the casting of Stallone -- playing way against type -- as the powerless hayseed sheriff in Cop Land is nothing short of inspired.","89","118887"
"18086","A war movie with a conscience, an action movie with a funny bone, a caper movie with a shifting agenda.","89","120188"
"18087","It's a thrilling, powerful movie, and one that certain people in certain quarters may have at one time called dangerous. Some of them may yet still.","89","181865"
"18088","Haynes brings the emotional underbelly to the surface, he also tricks up the visual surface with elaborate color schemes that provide unspoken clues regarding the characters’ frames of mind.","89","297884"
"18089","Fonda (who received an Oscar) and Sutherland are at the top of their game in this mystery/thriller that also provides a fascinating look into the mind and soul of a top NYC call girl.","89","67309"
"18090","This pleasantly rambling absurdist father/daughter drama is also one of the most strikingly unusual films of the year, period.","89","4048272"
"18091","A distinctive story with universal appeal.","89","1174732"
"18092","Wu quite simply is a stunner. Best known for playing the tough-love matriarch from ABC’s ""Fresh off the Boat,"" she betters the book version of Rachel by making her earthier, steelier, and more playful.","89","3104988"
"18093","If in previous films ""Adaptation"" and ""Being John Malkovich"" Jonze seemed a little squirmy about sex, his treatment here is fully adult and keenly sensitive to the complexities of sexual intimacy – how it relates to emotional intimacy, whether or not a flesh-and-blood body is required to achieve it.","89","1798709"
"18094","Weitz (About a Boy) is a sharp observer, and Tomlin and the rest of the cast are so superlative that any anxiety is quickly quelled. You’re happy to follow this movie over the river and through the woods.","89","4270516"
"18095","The Kids are All Right, a grin-cracking great portrait of a modern American family in minor and then major crises.","89","842926"
"18096","Room is ultimately not something you’d readily call enjoyable, but it is a cathartic and provocative reminder that life is full of possibilities and outcomes.","89","3170832"
"18097","A movie with style to burn, and, initially, that is this crime drama's most mesmerizing aspect.","89","114814"
"18098","The movie moves episodically, leisurely, through roughly a decade, and that feels like a gift: to nestle in with these extraordinary, ordinary people and get to know them.","89","2194499"
"18099","The tension is enough to make you slightly sick, and the overall mood of the thing is deeply dispiriting, but then, nobody ever said that war isn't hell.","89","887912"
"18100","At times poignant, joyful, and terrifying, Shawshank Redemption is an altogether brilliant movie and the debut of an equally brilliant director.","89","111161"
"18101","Wonderful performances anchor this biopic of country star Loretta Lynn's rise to fame. In a time before the TV music channels made star biographies into such a formulaic joke, Coal Miner's Daughter was the real deal.","89","80549"
"18102","So many things come together so beautifully in this movie based on the life of John Forbes Nash Jr. that you're likely to find yourself willing to benignly overlook its occasional biographical lapses and narrative sweetening.","89","268978"
"18103","Dingy atmosphere and great performances make this a standout.","89","54997"
"18104","A handsomely constructed and executed movie, the kind of effort that deserves appreciation, on its own terms, for what it both dares and accomplishes.","89","162222"
"18105","An order-of-magnitude leap forward in animated storytelling.","89","317705"
"18106","Corrosively funny yet emotionally devastating.","89","147612"
"18107","There's even a Simon and Garfunkel tune on the soundtrack, which makes Braff's character seem like the only living boy in New Jersey, which, of course, he may well be. L'chaim!","89","333766"
"18108","Nick and Nora Charles are one of the screen's great couples.","89","25878"
"18109","Basing the story on family history, Mendes’ terrifying view of war is poetic and tragic, dreamlike without the forced stoner surrealism that too often afflicts war dramas. It is instead impressionistic, most especially in its highly structured cinematography.","89","8579674"
"18110","Feels brief and dreamlike. Waking from its spell, you touch your face, and it's wet, but you're smiling anyway.","89","116209"
"18111","Director Alan Parker milks naturalistic performances out of his small cast and creates a brutal intensity rarely matched in cinema today. Michael Serensin's cinematography is oddly sedating yet intense, giving the prison and the whole country of Turkey a frightful, alien sort of feel.","89","77928"
"18112","Just strap in, because A Simple Favor's plot isn't just twisty: It's so labyrinthine that you expect a minotaur to pop up.","89","7040874"
"18113","O'Toole plays his seductive, grand, and dangerous director part as if this might be the role he wants to be remembered for.","89","81568"
"18114","For those who only recall Bana from his bland showing as Ang Lee's super-thyroidial meltdown monster, his performance here is a revelation.","89","408306"
"18115","The horror-movie clichés form the backbone from which the film's humor and creativity emerge. This Cabin may not be the Parthenon, but it's definitely a place to worship the gods of horror.","89","1259521"
"18116","Audience fortitude aside: This is compulsively watchable stuff, a masterstroke of thoughtful direction and thought-provoking performance.","89","2017038"
"18117","It's thrilling and lovely and sad and explosive in all the right ways, and it needs to be seen – on the big screen, in 3-D – to be believed.","89","499549"
"18118","Suspiria is not a movie that will gel with everyone. It will awaken the sickest, most twisted parts of your mind if you allow it.","89","1034415"
"18119","A sweet-natured romantic fable, albeit one that packs in carnivorous cockroaches, rampaging brontosaurs, and the ever-Freudian Empire State Building among its requisite emotional baggage. And, too, it's a corker of an action/monster movie.","89","360717"
"18120","Funny and sweet and guaranteed to flood you with good feeling.","89","845046"
"18121","Cooly feral in dark suit and tie, Glover’s the man in the gray flannel suit gone way, way over the edge, and it’s one of the most fully realized screen performances in ages, rats and all.","89","310357"
"18122","Grant punctuates almost every piece of Hock’s dialogue with an absurd gesture or facial expression – the theatricality of his portrayal of this not-so-street-smart bullshit artist is fascinating.","89","4595882"
"18123","It upholds deep respect for everything that makes a rom-com great: unabashed joy.","89","9484998"
"18124","The adaptation by Joel and Ethan Coen (both co-credited as writer and director) of McCarthy's as-if-written-for-the-screen No Country for Old Men becomes a marvelous meld of narrative faithfulness and pre-established sensibilities.","89","477348"
"18125","This movie is unbalanced and constantly fluctuating and as uneven as you’d expect from Spike Lee, but this time that works for the film rather than against. There’s a nationwide emergency, and Spike Lee, with BlacKkKlansman is screaming in your face for action at every turn.","89","7349662"
"18126","Frankenweenie is that rare film that's both kid- and adult-friendly.","89","1142977"
"18127","It’s not quite as brutalizing as McEwan’s brilliant source novel – it bears too much of a Great Art buff – but it ravishes nonetheless in its grand exploration of the sins of the daughter and a lifetime spent making reparations.","89","783233"
"18128","In a year when the coy social mores of upstairs and downstairs have been filtered once again through the aristocratic monocle of ""Downton Abbey,"" it's a relief that there's a film this year that tackles the servant/master relationship with the straight-for-the-jugular malice of Parasite.","89","6751668"
"18129","From the second it begins, Boogie Nights seizes your senses and pulls you right in: no turning back, no time for debate, no regrets.","89","118749"
"18130","A bitter, bloody masterpiece with adrenalized emotions and hyper-realized images, this is perhaps as close to battle as any sane human being should ever hope to tread.","89","120815"
"18131","Snatch is nothing if not watchable: It has the insane, popcorn rhythms of a Road Runner cartoon, and for that reason alone it's a minor masterpiece.","89","208092"
"18132","The sexual chemistry between Hepburn and Grant, when set against Charade's tumultuous backdrop of shifting identities, makes this movie an enduring favorite.","89","56923"
"18133","As things turn out, Clooney’s butt is just one of the many delights to be found on a trip to Solaris.","89","307479"
"18134","An abundance of color is present in Pain and Glory but the shades are more muted than Almodóvar’s early color-saturated work. Thematically and visually, this film has more in common with such Almodóvar dramas as ""All About My Mother"" and ""Talk to Her."" Pain and Glory is ultimately the story of an artist on the verge of a creative breakthrough.","89","8291806"
"18135","It takes a deft hand and a rare talent to make tyranny and state sanctioned torture so funny.","89","4686844"
"18136","Pennywise the Dancing Clown (Skarsgård) is as joltingly nightmarish as fans could have hoped for.","89","1396484"
"18137","With a story built around the need to bring everyone, all the oddballs and weirdos and lost friends and new friends together with peace, understanding, and a lack of judgement, maybe now is the time we really, truly need Bill & Ted.","89","1086064"
"18138","Searching for Bobby Fischer is a story that sounds, on paper, like something that shouldn't succeed as a movie but when played out so remarkably by all the parties involved, it becomes an unexpected treat.","89","108065"
"18139","The Diary of a Teenage Girl is the rare movie that presents the subject of the loss of virginity from the female perspective. Not only is the film unique in this regard, but also in its frankness, humor, and artistry.","89","3172532"
"18140","Don’t leave until the final credits finish rolling or you’ll miss what many are considering Kill Bill: Vol. 1’s best bit. Trust us on this one.","89","266697"
"18141","A crazed, lovestruck, wholly original (and yet amazingly referential) beast, part pop-culture wasteland, part glowing tribute, and part wild-eyed roller coaster (of love).","89","203009"
"18142","Blomkamp and his entire cast and crew have created an instant genre classic that transcends the self-limiting ghetto implied by the term ""science fiction"" and instead, like precursors such as Robert Wise's ""The Day the Earth Stood Still,"" engages not only the mind but the heart as well. It's magnificent.","89","1136608"
"18143","It's a jaw-droppingly good performance from this pint-sized, first-time actor.","89","2125435"
"18144","Hooper's vision is horrid yet engrossing... But the worst part about this vision is that despite its sensational aspects, it never seems too far from what could be the truth.","89","72271"
"18145","McKay makes moral outrage wickedly entertaining.","89","1596363"
"18146","The Last Station would have satisfied alone as a witty, manic lark, but as it moves toward the titular railway station, the film unfurls into so much more – a work of compassion, modulated mournfulness, and unchecked joy.","89","824758"
"18147","With such a frenetic, brain-melting load of images to ponder, it's easy to forget that there are also some terrific actors at work here, not the least of whom is the amazing Vinnie Jones.","89","120735"
"18148","It is rich with ideas and contemplations and packed with the sort of existential jokes that tickle the Coen boys so.","89","1019452"
"18149","A brilliant, exhilarating piece of filmmaking. It may even be the best mainstream film of the year thus far.","89","169547"
"18150","The actors, as a powerful and convincing ensemble, are equally understated and just as devastating.","89","247425"
"18151","In an age of doggedly unambitious comedy, one marvels at the finesse these first-time screenwriters and director Feig bring to marrying raunch, romantic comedy, and the tested but ever-true bond between women.","89","1478338"
"18152","The film is so velvety textured and dreamy, I would’ve stuck around for more. That is Cianfrance’s special talent.","89","1817273"
"18153","The film is hypnotic, which lends it an addictive sensibility that complements the need Adam and Eve have for their bloody fixes.","89","1714915"
"18154","This remarkable adaptation of the supposedly ""unfilmable"" novel by David Mitchell achieves near-perfection on virtually all levels.","89","1371111"
"18155","Crowe has rarely been better, and the same goes for director Scott, who parallels and then dovetails Lucas and Roberts' stories with sublime, gritty precision, working up to a magnificent ""Godfather III""-style crosscutting sequence that electrifies an already explosive tale.","89","765429"
"18156","If Overlord was a video game, it would be a great one. It just happens to be a movie, and it’s a great one of those too. It hits all old-school genre tropes so hard that they make new noises, and infuses cheesy grindhouse thrills with all the “you are there” intensity of a great interactive experience.","89","4530422"
"18157","This astonishing animated feature from first-time Slovenian director Krstić is required viewing for art history majors and anyone else with even a glancing interest in the works of everyone from Warhol to Gauguin, Diego Velázquez to Joan Miró.","89","6241872"
"18158","The humanistic approach makes Eastwood's movie a war story for the ages.","89","498380"
"18159","The spasmodic violence creates a stomach-churning counterbalance to the quiet palace intrigues, especially through the surgically placed classical Chinese score by Loudboy – much of it carried through duets by the commander and his wife on the guqin and guzheng (paired Chinese zithers), which becomes a subtle subplot in its own right.","89","6864046"
"18160","Sorkin smashes the cradle-to-grave biopic mold with Steve Jobs. R.I.P., I guess. It’s called a mold for a reason.","89","2080374"
"18161","Certainly one of the best drug movies ever made.... Great performances make this dispassionate study a memorable experience.","89","97240"
"18162","Above all else, Birdman is tender, raucously funny and deeply tragic.","89","2562232"
"18163","It's not necessary to be a longtime fan of the Star Trek universe to appreciate the sheer emotional punch and swagger of this rough and randy Enterprise crew.","89","796366"
"18164","Clearly the single best, the single coolest (to borrow from Harry Knowles) animated film in a great while.","89","129167"
"18165","Danny Boyle's 127 Hours is the calm, cool, and tear-your-hair-out exciting mirror image of Tony Scott's bland and formulaic ""Unstoppable.""","89","1542344"
"18166","Everything fits perfectly, from titles to fin, but most of all Firth, who dons the role of George like a fine bespoke suit.","89","1315981"
"18167","This is horror with a wink and a nod to drive-in theatres and sweaty back seats. This is how it's done.","89","116367"
"18168","Depp, as the the fragile but irresistibily fabulous title character, is a delight.","89","99487"
"18169","One thing about this extremely talented artist: He never sees anything in just black-and-white.","89","4326444"
"18170","This is Denzel Washington’s third at bat behind the camera while directing himself and, holy smokes, does he knock it out of the park with a vicious, visceral performance that fairly sets the screen ablaze.","89","2671706"
"18171","Absurdist humor abounds throughout a story whose underlying themes echo Elvis Costello’s eternal question, “What’s so funny ’bout peace, love, and understanding?” even as corpses dangle from a foregrounded gallows.","89","2584384"
"18172","Funny and touching, Frances Ha may very well be the most eloquent take yet on a generation in flux – a cinematic talk-back to so many Atlantic articles, minus the scolding and the statistics, and uncharacteristically (for Baumbach) uncynical.","89","2347569"
"18173","At long, long last: the real thing.","89","102926"
"18174","Fantasies and phantasms aside, Fincher proves himself yet again to be a better cinematic psychologist of (in-)human nature than almost any other director alive. It’s another squirmily excellent date movie from hell, courtesy of contemporary cinema’s most overt nihilist.","89","2267998"
"18175","Fight Club's dirty little secret is it's one of the best comedies of the decade.","89","137523"
"18176","The Rider is a stunning piece of fiction played close to the bone.","89","6217608"
"18177","A technologically marvelous animated movie that's just as funny and inventive as the first, but also more emotionally engaging than most live-action films. This is clearly a sequel in name only.","89","120363"
"18178","I can't remember the last time I felt so seduced by a film.","89","780504"
"18179","It is wonderful for what it is: a delightful, thoroughly satisfying comedy of modern manners.","89","138524"
"18180","A glorious, action-and-pathos packed capstone to the rebooted Apes franchise.","89","3450958"
"18181","It's a veritable shoo-in for an Oscar nod this year, and one of the more disturbing films to come out of a major studio in ages.","89","1392214"
"18182","Gravity is a major filmmaking accomplishment, no doubt, although it would have been interesting to see how it might have played sans dialogue. Unthinkable to Hollywood, sure, but still … Kowalski and Stone’s backstories and banter are, in the end, secondary to the film’s jaw-dropping visuals.","89","1454468"
"18183","In its cinematic incarnation, Sex and the City has lost none of its bawdiness yet gained a more profound sense of soberness. Parker, especially, who in the last season of the show bordered on insufferable in her affected squeaks and shrieks, is allowed to go to very dark places – to be, in fact, quite unfabulous.","89","1000774"
"18184","Nobody’s a monster here, and that’s the subtle, aching rub of Little Men: Everyone is right in their claim, depending on the right angle, be it economic, sentimental, moral, or fraternal.","89","4919484"
"18185","Nothing short of horror-hound heaven.","89","1127180"
"18186","With American independent film teeming with so many shaky-cam snarksters, what an electric riposte to the status quo is Nichols, whose films are classically constructed and deadly serious. In his short but potent career, he’s mastered a wide-vistaed eye for the epic and the elemental.","89","1935179"
"18187","Substantive and imaginatively filmed but is not an off-putting art movie; rather, it's the kind of solid but accessible filmmaking that prevailed in Hollywood's golden age.","89","387131"
"18188","The most original comedy from either side of the pond in years.","89","365748"
"18189","One of the best movies I've seen this year and, consequently, the less said about it here the better. The beauty of this movie is in the way it twists and turns, thwarting expectations, confounding stereotypes and venturing into places you least anticipate.","89","104036"
"18190","Snowpiercer holds its own; it’s an unruly but rattling – and ravishing – work of art. On first watch, I wondered if there was anything to scratch beneath the surface – it seemed so straightforward, I worried there wasn’t enough there there – so I rewatched it almost right away and was surprised to find it still left me panting.","89","1706620"
"18191","What makes Under the Skin such a mind-blower has everything to do with Johansson’s chillingly unempathetic turn as the, well, whatever she is, coupled with cinematographer Daniel Landin’s disorienting, hallucinogenic visuals.","89","1441395"
"18192","Pawn Sacrifice is intelligent, absorbing, never boring, and skillfully tense when it should be.","89","1596345"
"18193","Blisteringly entertaining.","89","1285016"
"18194","From its brilliant and sublime opening sequence to its self-reflexive ending, The Player distills everything that's wrong with the American film industry with the precision of someone who's been there.","89","105151"
"18195","In many ways even more hellish and stylish than its predecessor... A horror cult classic.","89","92991"
"18196","As if the dazzling performances and audaciously intertwined storylines weren’t enough, Waves is a visual stunner, too, thanks to director of photography Drew Daniels, whose restless, reckless camerawork paints a family tragedy in dizzying, near-psychedelic hues, mirroring the increasingly frenetic storyline.","89","8652728"
"18197","Yes, it's a coming-out film, but it breaks that mold by being thoroughly unpredictable. It's a coming-of-age film, too, and by virtue of of telling the story of a young, black lesbian, Pariah also ventures into novel territory for a motion picture.","89","1233334"
"18198","The work of a fine craftsman and artist.","89","165854"
"18199","The effect is devastating, both emotionally and physically. You literally can’t take your eyes off Saul.","89","3808342"
"18200","This is high fantasy of the best kind.","89","120737"
"18201","A genuinely outrageous and occasionally brilliant coupling of American animation and classic early-Eighties heavy metal (does anybody even remember Riggs and Trust?).","89","82509"
"18202","Jenkins' superlative work proves her first film was no fluke; let's hope it doesn't take another nine years to hear from her again.","89","775529"
"18203","An altogether more viscerally engaging film, from its relentless pacing and slam-bang effects work to the fine, appropriately heroic score by John Ottman. That the movie has an obvious gay subtext neither adds nor detracts from the film’s smashing popcorn appeal.","89","290334"
"18204","Ryan O’Neal has never been better cast than as the shallow and opportunistic hero of Thackeray’s early 19th-century novel.","89","72684"
"18205","Niccol's futuristic fable is a gorgeous construct, from its cast on down to the brilliant, clinical nature of the set design that reflects a future in which even a particle of saliva can be one's undoing.","89","119177"
"18206","Disturbing, harrowing, visceral, and even sporadically humorous, Kids is one of those rare films that begs the description “a must-see.” For once, it's the truth.","89","113540"
"18207","Love, death, hope, and hatred: Spider-Man 2 has ’em all, in spades.","89","316654"
"18208","This is a quest movie, with a lot of ground covered, and just as our heroes never stay long in one place or feel safe in their surroundings, neither does the audience.","89","926084"
"18209","The on-target performances, along with the unceasing barrage of popular music and daring narrative gambles, combine to make Trainspotting one of the grand movie rushes of 1996.","89","117951"
"18210","This Tom Clancy thriller gets the proper screen treatment here with this first-rate cast and direction by one of the genre’s best: Die Hard director John McTiernan.","89","99810"
"18211","With caustic wit and fantastic performances for all involved, the film is destined to be an anti-war classic.","89","6896536"
"18212","The performances of all the central and secondary characters match the passionate intensity of the film's behind-the-scenes collaborators.","89","120603"
"18213","This is a film that alternatively shows humanity in all its ugly glory as well is its quiet moments of beauty.","89","6155172"
"18214","A phantom of a movie whose beautiful flakes fall into the deep crevices of memory long after the seasons change.","89","491747"
"18215","Shot in winter grays with no warming ambers and the whiff of tuberculosis hanging around all the players, Inside Llewyn Davis is a chilly thing – a nominal comedy in brisk shivers.","89","2042568"
"18216","Pixar's Finding Nemo may well have the best casting of any animated film of the past 30-odd years.","89","266543"
"18217","Hoffman and Bancroft are phenomenally cast in a script co-written by Buck Henry and Calder Willingham that is by turns sly, touching, and amazingly fresh 30 years later. [Review of re-release]","89","61722"
"18218","The crisp imagery (by Radek Ładczuk) creates a true sense of menace amid the household banality. Tales about mothers who fear their offspring also strike at a very primal level of mythic storytelling. Vigilance is the only means of protection against creatures from the id.","89","2321549"
"18219","The beauty of Redford’s rock-steady performances over the last six decades or so is that he never showed off, and yet always commanded your attention.","89","2837574"
"18220","Coco is animatedly empowering entertainment for anyone who’s ever had to go against the wishes of their family to achieve their most heartfelt dreams.","89","2380307"
"18221","Saulnier and co. have crafted a gleefully merciless update on Deliverance, except instead of city folk vs. hillbillies, it’s punk rockers vs. neo-Nazis, and it is one of the most brutal, visceral films to come along in quite some time.","89","4062536"
"18222","Just the thing to clear your Capra-glutted holiday movie palate.","89","134119"
"18223","This is tragedy at its most hilarious and comedy to break your heart; sweet violence in a hellish fairy tale.","89","97202"
"18224","Wright takes the tools of a bloodless medium, the video game, and crafts an action-comedy with a true-blue beating heart.","89","446029"
"18225","But let's be honest: Any actress can do melancholy; it takes a special talent to recognize that there's a certain luxuriousness, a certain joy, to be found in longtime self-hatred.","89","1068649"
"18226","Looper makes a full-meal entertainment out of piecemealing genres: It boasts the kicky mental gymnastics that come with time-travel terrain, the relentless rapid heart rate of a crackerjack thriller, and the bursts of extreme violence, buttressed with black humor, of a modern actioner.","89","1276104"
"18227","A stronger structure underpinning these emotions run amok would have benefitted the film, but then what would feelings be without a little messiness? For many viewers, giving their own Joy and Sadness a workout will be enough to make Inside Out a valuable experience.","89","2096673"
"18228","The range of characters here is daringly broad, but Sayles is able to touch on the humanity of each (with considerable help from a gifted and eminently watchable cast), and the details of the region -- the heat, the beautiful but often unforgiving landscape, and especially the pride of the residents -- are vivid and true.","89","116905"
"18229","Remarkably fresh and exciting.","89","305206"
"18230","Could easily have tipped over into melodrama, but Schnabel is too much an artist to let that happen; he realizes that in order to make his hero truly substantial, and not just sympathetic, he has to present him as an ordinary man making the best of extraordinarily lousy circumstances. By doing so he’s created a character we not only marvel at but identify with.","89","401383"
"18231","As with all of Lee's films, there's much more going on beneath the surface than is immediately apparent.","89","454848"
"18232","Langella is terrific in a small but critical role as CBS president William Paley, although the one essential problem with the film is that it never clearly delineates the jobs fulfilled by the cluster of other newsroom employees that are always huddled about.","89","433383"
"18233","It is with immense pleasure that I can report that Disney's Muppet reboot movie is an absolute delight.","89","1204342"
"18234","Szpilman takes to performing sonatas in thin air, eyes closed, those jittery fingers stroking nothing but air. It's a wonderful moment in a wonderful, ghastly film, and one of the most moving arguments for the redemptive powers of art ever made.","89","253474"
"18235","A film that wants you to get happy.","89","211915"
"18236","The Big Sick is as personal as it gets, but Gordon and Nanjiani pull no punches and steer well clear of preciousness. I laughed plenty at their film, cried my guts out, too, and went home elated.","89","5462602"
"18237","This is an animated film that happily has room for both an existentialist dread of death and a grinning joie de vivre.","89","432283"
"18238","Light Sleeper represents Schrader at his best, giving us a character we've become familiar with over the years and Schrader's intimate mastery of our fascination with decadence, loss and redemption.","89","102307"
"18239","With original director John Carpenter's blessing, Green manages something that is both a tribute to and an evolution of the 1978 classic, with moments designed to create resonances that are not just re-enactment but part of his bigger theme of trauma-causing scars (there are also, in a nod to his days as an Austin resident, a couple of subtle visual nods to the original The Texas Chain Saw Massacre).","89","1502407"
"18240","More emotionally complex than even I had thought possible, Chasing Amy is the sound of burgeoning genius on the fast track to maturity.","89","118842"
"18241","This is a dream cast for both Scorsese and the viewer, and everyone is working at the peak of their craft. Nicholson's flawless performance as the increasingly unhinged crime boss is a marvel of manic, paranoid ruination.","89","407887"
"18242","This may be the first film to examine the intricacies of the Colombia-to-U.S. drug route in any detail.","89","390221"
"18243","As good as it ever was, and improved slightly by hindsight, experience, and extra cash.","89","86979"
"18244","To this day, Dueling Banjoes still gives me the willies.","89","68473"
"18245","At the center of it all stands Reeves, a convincing embodiment of both the calm before the storm and its subsequent capacity for ruin.","89","2911666"
"18246","A rare achievement.","89","159365"
"18247","Cox, who wrote and directed the film, creates a strange but hilarious view of our culture, a brilliant satire on modern society...deserves the same respect and attention given to ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" and ""This Is Spinal Tap,"" two films that define the cult category.","89","87995"
"18248","We will be comparing Up with classics like ""The Wizard of Oz"" for years to come.","89","1049413"
"18249","Mystic River asks plenty of questions but rarely if ever offers any answers, and certainly no easy ones. If this fine and sorrowful film is what can be expected from our aging cinema icons, here’s to the golden years, dark though they may be.","89","327056"
"18250","A lovely, quietly thrilling thing.","89","335266"
"18251","In terms of sheer, unrelenting visual invention, Velvet Goldmine is a wonder.","89","120879"
"18252","Ocean’s 8 is the most satisfying installment in the franchise. The all-star cast is impeccable, the shift in focus yields sharp insights, and the heist itself is wily and enjoyable. What the film lacks in suspense it makes up for in style, and that style has undeniable substance.","89","5164214"
"18253","The Queen is palace intrigue at its finest.","89","436697"
"18254","A History of Violence poses the right question: Are those who don't study history doomed to repeat it?","89","399146"
"18255","The masterful Land of Mine slowly, almost without notice, transforms into one of the most viscerally intense anti-war films since Dalton Trumbo’s ""Johnny Got His Gun.""","89","3841424"
"18256","He's (Flanagan) never trying to one-up Kubrick or King. Instead, he's trying to push past his own best work, and he may well have achieved that in one supernatural scene that is as shocking and captivating as the fall of the bent-neck lady. In honoring both Kubrick and King, Flanagan's greatest achievement is not being swallowed by the Overlook's shadow.","89","5606664"
"18257","A remarkable balance of sentimentality and harshness, darkness and light.","89","109830"
"18258","We've come to expect each new Demme film to percolate to an urgently musical beat. (The Manchurian Candidate also features a few cameos by musicians as diverse as Robyn Hitchcock and Fab Five Freddy.)","89","368008"
"18259","Thornton, who wrote, directed, and stars in Sling Blade, has created an unforgettable character and situation, a film that's sure to become an American classic.","89","117666"
"18260","Campion’s story of a tubercular poet and his lady love recasts the hackneyed old stanza in refreshing new verse.","89","810784"
"18261","It’s that feeling of seeing something unlike anything you’ve ever seen before. It’s the experience of witnessing the fresh, the new. And if you love movies, there’s nothing like it.","89","3890160"
"18262","It's a masterful film, the kind you itch to see twice or more, as elliptical as a dream and as direct as the short sharp shock of lead kissing flesh.","89","449467"
"18263","Haneke (Caché) has created a morality tale that concludes with the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand: one more example of a solitary act of violence that unleashes a cataclysm.","89","1149362"
"18264","Filled with brilliant, stand-out performances.","89","128445"
"18265","While this is arguably Greengrass’ best film, it’s almost certainly his most urgent.","89","1535109"
"18266","God forbid this should ever play on an IMAX screen -- the concussive soundtrack and relentless visuals would likely strike viewers deaf and blind (but what a way to go!). Simply breathtaking.","89","167261"
"18267","I don't want to oversell the thing. It is, quite simply, something very special indeed.","89","386117"
"18268","When people think fondly of John Hughes, it's movies like Ferris Bueller that they're thinking of.","89","91042"
"18269","Director Michael Lehmann made a stunning debut with this sharp satire of teen cliques.","89","97493"
"18270","Disney's latest animated feature hearkens back to its heyday fare, a sweet and captivating tale that pits gentle, enduring goodness against dark, malevolent forces.","89","120762"
"18271","Everything about this swift and gorgeous and tremendously enjoyable film is played out in a rush of staccato edits, crisp performances, and charmingly giddy subplots that coalesce into Spielberg's most purely entertaining movie in years.","89","264464"
"18272","Face/Off works like a charm right on down the line thanks to brilliant, exhilarating performances from Cage and Travolta, and the many tremendously enjoyable action set-pieces that are Woo's hallmark.","89","119094"
"18273","Grief doesn't exactly sound like a promising starting point for a love story, but, really, what a bounty Mills presents to us of beauty and buoyancy and possibility.","89","1532503"
"18274","Pixar's animation is simply flawless; colorful, deeply realized, and ably conveying both the chaos of the kitchen, and the sensual allure of food well prepared.","89","382932"
"18275","Yes, Black Panther is a moment. But in 20 years' time (or 100 more Marvel films), when this moment has passed, it will still be the kind of resonant, rip-roaring crowd-pleaser to which all smart action films should aspire.","89","1825683"
"18276","Although the characters and their backstories are carefully thought out, Delpy and Hawke deliver their dialogue as if spontaneous and unmeditated.","89","381681"
"18277","It packs a hefty emotional wallop.","89","367089"
"18278","This fresh adaptation shakes the dust off Jane Austen's early 19th-century novel of manners and gives it a good airing out. The result is a witty and lovesick skirmish of the sexes that exceeds all expectations.","89","414387"
"18279","A restless, nervy actor, Hardy seems to get a kick out of tying one hand behind his back. He dominated ""The Dark Knight Rises"" even with a modified ball gag obscuring most of his face. Here, locked behind a steeling wheel and a conceptual gimmick, he only has the upper half of his body to work with. No surprise to anybody who’s been paying attention: Half a Hardy adds up to a hell of a lot.","89","2692904"
"18280","It's a ""keep calm, carry on"" wartime melodrama of the first order, and stiff though it may be, it is never less than brilliantly done.","89","1504320"
"18281","Crowe has created a genuine love song for all those who've ever felt their lives to have been saved by rock & roll.","89","181875"
"18282","Hustlers is an absolute joy and one of the most refreshing movies you’ll see all year.","89","5503686"
"18283","What's best about Markus and McFeely's script is that they understand the characters.","89","4154796"
"18284","This is Pixar's finest and most emotionally powerful film yet, and it draws on a wealth of cinematic resources that run the gamut from Chaplin's best to Buster Keaton, Jacques Tati, and even Martin and Lewis.","89","910970"
"18285","The end result is a delightful, though a smidge too long, reminder of one of the reasons we so enjoy going to the movies: perchance to dream.","89","138097"
"18286","The cast is pitch-perfect, scoring big laughs, heart swells, and even tears. Feldstein and Dever are a phenomenal comedy duo; Lourd is a stellar standout. And Wilde crushed it right out the gate.","89","1489887"
"18287","In her first solo writing and directing effort, the hard-working indie film actress Greta Gerwig proves that she is her own muse. She takes the well-worn coming-of-age-dramedy format and fashions something fresh, funny, and artful from its familiar tropes. Also delivering the goods is a knockout cast of accomplished veterans and relative newcomers.","89","4925292"
"18288","Marks the end of an era of good -- even very good -- Disney animated features, and the start (one hopes) of a new period of great ones.","89","97757"
"18289","Who would have ever thought to pair up Stanley Kubrick and Stephen King? But weird as it sounds, this creepy thriller works.","89","81505"
"18290","This Romeo & Juliet is a rich visual feast, besotted with the fervor of its acrobatic camerawork and kinetic staging and its mind-bending aggregation of unrelated but resonant fragments of 20th-century iconography.","89","117509"
"18291","Cloverfield is the most intense and original creature feature I've seen in my adult moviegoing life, and that's coming from a guy who knows his Gojira from his Gamera and his Harryhausen from his Honda. Cloverfield isn't a horror film – it's a pure-blood, grade A, exultantly exhilarating monster movie.","89","1060277"
"18292","When looking at the one-two punch of The Lighthouse and ""The Witch,"" Eggers seems to find inspiration in how superstition and folklore blurred the boundaries of human knowledge throughout history. His characters live in the space between mankind and mysticism, where things like witches and mermaids can (and maybe even do) gain access to our homes.","89","7984734"
"18293","The performances are first-rate, and Anderson as the obsessively attached maid Mrs. Danvers is a perverse gem.","89","32976"
"18294","It's Cronenberg's film, but it's the actors who elevate Eastern Promises from mere thriller to some other, more disturbing plane.","89","765443"
"18295","I cannot think of another film that plainly and comprehensively lays bare the both the complex apparatus at work, and the people dedicated to serving its populace.","89","12094720"
"18296","This film began the fine tradition of deviating from Ian Fleming's novels, which gave us the suave, sophisticated Bond over Fleming's monosyllabic misogynist.","89","57076"
"18297","Absolutely harrowing, shocking in its sudden revelatory immediacy, and very, very well done, Black Hawk Down is one of the best depictions of the outright lunacy inherent to battle I have ever seen.","89","265086"
"18298","A gorgeous, violent, brilliant puzzle box of a movie that relishes in how convoluted it is, and pays off every second of attention.","89","6723592"
"18299","Eminem plays Rabbit with riveting, flamboyantly expressive intensity.","90","298203"
"18300","This astonishingly gritty film maintains its strong niche between Roberto Rossellini's ""Open City"" and Paul Greengrass' ""Bloody Sunday"" as a pinnacle of war-torn neo-realist drama.","90","58946"
"18301","The Apartment is an important and provocative film.","90","53604"
"18302","Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse delivers a dynamic visual experience unlike any other.","90","4633694"
"18303","Green Book is a real crowd pleaser — aside from the banter between the oppositely-minded characters, it has clear heroes and villains. The writers do manage to sneak a few nuances in, especially when discussing Shirley feeling out of place in both the white and black communities.","90","6966692"
"18304","Toy Story 3 is very much a worthy entry in the series, a movie well worth making (and seeing). It continues the legacy. It just doesn't expand upon it.","90","435761"
"18305","Shot on Super 16mm, the visible grain giving each image a wonderfully tactile depth and life, Wes Anderson's Moonrise Kingdom is, in a lot of ways, the ur–Wes Anderson film.","90","1748122"
"18306","It's a true-life yarn loaded with extremes, of wealth, personal eccentricities, grief, tension, daring, criminal means to political ends, maternal drive and luck, both bad and good. It is also a peek into a rarefied world where money knows no bounds and yet means everything.","90","5294550"
"18307","Dramatically gripping while still brandishing a droll undercurrent of humor, this beautifully made film will certainly be embraced as one of the best Bonds by loyal fans worldwide and leaves you wanting the next one to turn up sooner than four years from now.","90","1074638"
"18308","Beetlejuice means something good: that imaginative artists can bring a fading genre back from the dead. [11 Apr 1988]","90","94721"
"18309","Spider-Man brings the beloved comic-book character to the screen with both angst and action undamaged by the move.","90","145487"
"18310","Funny, poignant, personal and a rage-filled valentine to a metropolis that’s seen its fair share of gentrification.","90","4353250"
"18311","A sensitive, intimate, enormously touching drama.","90","203230"
"18312","A vigorous and involving salute to professionalism and being good at your job, Sully vividly portrays the physical realities and human elements in the dramatic safe landing of a crippled US Airways jet on the Hudson River on January 15, 2009.","90","3263904"
"18313","If nothing else, Into the Wild is a beautiful film. Penn meticulously shot in the actual locations McCandless visited, and Eric Gautier's cinematography is breathtaking, many scenes are framed in such a way as to almost Hirsch entirely, further emphasizing how solitary his trek actually was.","90","758758"
"18314","A hilarious and unexpectedly profound comedy.","90","107048"
"18315","It is the hilarious business of Shrek, a delightful new animated feature based on the William Steig book, to subvert all the well-worn expectations of its genre.","90","126029"
"18316","It is much better and funnier than the ""The Sting"" precisely because it allows the two stars to play off each other.","90","64115"
"18317","Ryder, Hawke, Stiller and Garofalo turn these paradigms into wonderfully tasty characters. Written with verve and played with grace, Reality Bites is too smart to pass itself off as a definitive statement, but it gets the details delightfully right.","90","110950"
"18318","Inevitably a little patchier and less startlingly original than its predecessor -- S2 is an ingenious, often hilarious, movie that does nothing to diminish the well-deserved cult reputation of its director.","90","120082"
"18319","Generally grim, occasionally startling, and altogether enthralling sixth chapter in a movie franchise that keeps managing to surprise just when one would expect it to be puttering along on auto-broomstick.","90","417741"
"18320","Batman Begins emerges from the darkness and leaves a powerful, lasting impression.","90","372784"
"18321","Twenty-four years later -- digitally spruced up, with some scenes shaved and others padded with previously cut material -- Scott's film still shreds nerves.","90","78748"
"18322","With solid bodywork, clever feints and tremendous heart, it scores at least a TKO, by which I mean both that it falls just short of overpowering greatness - I can't quite exclaim, ""It's a knockout!"" - and that the most impressive thing about it is technique.","90","964517"
"18323","Guillermo del Toro is more than a filmmaker, he's a fantasy visionary with an outsized imagination and a fanatical specificity, a creator of out-of-this world universes carefully conceived down to the smallest detail. His particular gifts and passions are on display in the long-awaited Pacific Rim and the results are spectacular.","90","1663662"
"18324","This intelligent, engaging indie sets out to find a few answers and in the process introduces a clutch of interesting, very human characters.","90","268690"
"18325","Tin Men is a tale of transitions and a test of mettle, as sweet as a slow dance, as classy and cumbersome as a Coupe de Ville.","90","94155"
"18326","The strangest thing about The Shape of Water, which should be one almighty mess, is that it succeeds. The streams of story converge, and, as in any good fairy tale, that which is deemed ugly and unworthy, by a myopic world, is revealed to be a pearl beyond price.","90","5580390"
"18327","It's an unforgettable, moving and brilliantly acted drama that richly deserves to be seen by anyone who cherishes great filmmaking.","90","935075"
"18328","As the ghouls evolve toward humanity and the humans toward ghouldom, we can appreciate Romero for using horror to show us How We Live Now, and How We're Living Dead now, too.","90","418819"
"18329","With such awe-inspiring artistry, designed so as to never distract from the material it serves, Kubo and the Two Strings stands as the sort of film that feels richer with each successive viewing, from the paper-folded Laika logo at the beginning (an early taste of the stunning origami sequences to follow) to the emotional resonance of its final shot.","90","4302938"
"18330","It's the atmospheric sideshow that earns the highest marks.","90","230600"
"18331","The 11-year-old Osment evokes the boy's terror and awful predicament so memorably, you'll never forget him.","90","167404"
"18332","An imaginative and largely intact retelling of this gory, troubling, uniquely sweet and uniquely dark vampire tale.","90","1228987"
"18333","Costner (with Michael Blake's screenplay) creates a vision so childlike, so willfully romantic, it's hard to put up a fight.","90","99348"
"18334","With Williams giving a virtuoso fast-mumbling performance as the hero, and gags ranging from expertly choreographed slapstick to subtle verbal infelicities (Popeye muttering about 'venerable disease'), it is far too sophisticated to function merely as kids' fodder. Often, watching the actors contorting themselves into non-human shapes, you wonder how on earth Altman did it; equally often, you feel you are watching a wacky masterpiece, the like of which you've never seen before.","90","81353"
"18335","Salt moves ever forward -- pushing, pushing, pushing its heroine to greater feats every minute. It doesn't stop for martinis, either shaken or stirred, or any other detours. The movie is lean and muscular, looking for action even in situations where a little sleight of hand might have done the trick.","90","944835"
"18336","The rare sequel that not only improves on but retroactively justifies its predecessor, this lightning-paced caper-comedy shifts the franchise into high gear with international intrigue, spy-movie spoofery and more automotive puns than you can shake a stickshift at, handling even its broader stretches with sophistication, speed and effortless panache.","90","1216475"
"18337","One of the year's most imaginative and uniquely exciting pieces of cinema.","90","206634"
"18338","Its cleverness is exceptionally congenial and sustained. [13 Apr 1984, p.B1]","90","88258"
"18339","It's a brisk, smart satirical comedy from the writers of ""Police Academy"" and the director of ""Valley Girl,"" set in a Caltech-like institution for the whiz kids of the sciences. How refreshing it is to see young people depicted as having a capacity for thought as well as emotion.","90","89886"
"18340","One of the few recent movies I have seen that plunged me into that rare, giddy state of pleasurable confusion, of not knowing what would happen next, which I associate with the reading and moviegoing experiences of my own childhood. But there is no reason that children should have a monopoly on this primal, wonderful experience.","90","311289"
"18341","There hasn't been a studio movie as unapologetically adult, sophisticated, and nuanced as Up in the Air in some time.","90","1193138"
"18342","The picture is almost shamefully entertaining, bold and self-effacing at once: Its intelligence reveals itself as a devilish gleam, not a pompous layer of shellac. Why can't more Hollywood movies be like this one?","90","386140"
"18343","Mr. Quaid has long been a reliably likable actor, but this time he pitches a perfect performance -- no frills, no tricks, not a single false note -- in a film that's true to its stirring subject, and to the sweetest traditions of the game.","90","265662"
"18344","A wicked, sexy and ultimately devastating study of a young dancer's all-consuming ambition, Black Swan serves as a fascinating complement to Darren Aronofsky's ""The Wrestler,"" trading the grungy world of a broken-down fighter for the more upscale but no less brutal sphere of professional ballet.","90","947798"
"18345","Brooks' fast-paced direction is a masterpiece of comedy detail, filled with delightful and perfectly timed sight gags.","90","71230"
"18346","A modest, skillful, unfussy genre piece that tells an exciting story and lets its more serious concerns remain just below the surface, gently complicating the smooth-flowing rhythms of the narrative.","90","112857"
"18347","The disturbing, involving, always-complex story of British mathematician Alan Turing is a tale crafted to resonate for our time, and the smartly entertaining The Imitation Game gives it the kind of crackerjack cinematic presentation that's pure pleasure to experience.","90","2084970"
"18348","This replaces the British version's tight, economic plotting and quirky social observations with altogether glossier production values and a typically '50s examination of the family under melodramatic stress.","90","49470"
"18349","At his provocative best, though - in his brilliant, gorgeous 2009 film ""The White Ribbon,"" a study of the roots of fascism in domestic tyranny, and now in Amour - Haneke implicates us in the full range of human capacity.","90","1602620"
"18350","It's a real writer's movie, happy to linger on a psychologically telling moment--and audiences expecting a big payoff may feel disappointed. ""Diner"" isn't the kind of movie that jumps up and down to please. But while seeming to traverse familiar ground, Levinson and his superb young cast are sprinkling it with sparkling insights. [19 Apr 1982, p.96]","90","83833"
"18351","A sparkling romantic comedy, the kind of picture that glides by so gracefully and unpretentiously that it's only upon reflection that you realize how much skill, caring and good judgment had to have gone into its making.","90","120888"
"18352","This film has everything for the all-important female audience: feisty heroines, lots of slapstick, great clothes.","90","120783"
"18353","Allen has crafted a wry and thoughtful film about the peculiar stirrings of the heart that is certainly his most accomplished piece of work since 2005's ""Match Point"" and arguably his funniest in the eight years since ""Small Time Crooks.""","90","497465"
"18354","An odyssey of horror and suspense that's as tightly wound as a garrote and as beautifully designed as a guillotine. [24 Feb 1986, p.81]","90","91209"
"18355","Al Pacino again is outstanding as Michael Corleone, successor to crime family leadership.","90","71562"
"18356","The great thing about Hail, Caesar! is that it is fun whether you get all its references or not.","90","475290"
"18357","If Elise and Frank are opaque to each other, they're opaque for a reason, as, sadly, lovers sometimes are. (Come to think of it, this picture has more in common with ""The Lives of Others"" than you might expect.)","90","1243957"
"18358","This 1971 thriller about a heroin bust is solid, slick filmmaking, full of dirty cops, shrewd operators, and slam-bang action. Friedkin's close study of Raoul Walsh pays off in the justly celebrated chase sequence.","90","67116"
"18359","When it comes to the tantalizing prolongation of suspense, nobody does it better than De Palma. He has absorbed and adapted the Hitchcock's fondness and flair for sustaining exposition through sheer pictorial virtuosity, his mischievous erotic humor and even his ambiguous mixture of morbid, romantic and comic impulses. [25 July 1980, p.C1]","90","80661"
"18360","Startlingly vigorous and entertaining piece of work.","90","112573"
"18361","Quietly devastating.","90","108052"
"18362","It’s a serious blast, with a plot that zigs and zags (but only because it sticks, within reason, to the facts), and a cast of characters who are so eccentrically scuzzy that maybe no one could have dreamed them up.","90","5580036"
"18363","Mr. Mooney, currently cutting it up on “Saturday Night Live,” manages the twists and tonal fluctuations in Brigsby Bear beautifully.","90","5805752"
"18364","The Time Machine is an old-fashioned adventure that tries to remain as true to the original text as it could (the ending of the book isn't the same here, along with various other additions and changes) with an excellent score, great special effects, and a story that keeps you watching thanks to the excellent narration throughout the film.","90","54387"
"18365","An enthralling and rigorously realistic outer-space survival story.","90","3659388"
"18366","Spielberg's Empire of the Sun dispels with the sugar coating that turned Alice Walker's searing novel about racial and sexual subjugation into ""The Color Purple: The Coffee Table Edition."" Yet, Spielberg retains a sense of innocence in this ambitious, visionary tale. [10 Dec 1987, p.6]","90","92965"
"18367","An inventive, meaty distillation of Le Carre's 1974 novel, picture turns hero George Smiley's hunt for a mole within Blighty's MI6 into an incisive examination of Cold War ethics, rich in both contempo resonance and elegiac melancholy.","90","1340800"
"18368","The definitive representation of young American men at the start of the 21st century.","90","181984"
"18369","Sam Mendes' much-anticipated second effort after his Oscar-winning ""American Beauty"" finds him working in a very different key while displaying an even more pronounced attentiveness to tone, genre variations and artistic niceties.","90","257044"
"18370","One of those special movies whose freshness and vitality are so bounteously infectious, your humble reviewer wishes everyone had the pleasure of discovering it brand-new and undescribed.","90","120655"
"18371","Gorgeous filmmaking that brims over with funhouse thrills and ravishing romance.","90","162661"
"18372","This is Depp's coming-of-age role, and he's terrific. Pacino, who's shown more flash than substance recently, reminds us how great he can be when he loses himself inside a character. The bond between these two makes the film sing.","90","119008"
"18373","This is an amazing film, both for what it did in 1953 and what it still does today. It's a far better interpretation of H.G. Wells' novel than Spielberg's abrupt and lopsided film.","90","46534"
"18374","What’s energizing and exciting about Amy, especially when compared with the sexless cuties populating rom-coms, in which female pleasure is often expressed through shopping, is that her erotic appetites aren’t problems that she needs to narratively solve and vanquish.","90","3152624"
"18375","Ford's admirers have rightly tended to play this down in favor of his later and more personal westerns, but there's much to admire here in Gregg Toland's sun-beaten photography and Henry Fonda's meticulous performance as Steinbeck's dashboard saint, Tom Joad.","90","32551"
"18376","This uncommonly intelligent thriller evokes the great films of the 1970s (""All the President's Men,"" ""Klute,"" ""Three Days of the Condor"") that managed to elicit gritty urban realism while maintaining a suave sense of style and moral complexity.","90","465538"
"18377","A witty, raunchy comedy, which proves that a well-written piece of business – oozing with sex, wit and nasty intrigue – works for any generation.","90","139134"
"18378","A fresh, disarmingly bright and at times explosively funny comedy well worth a trip to the mall, even if it eventually runs out of gas.","90","112697"
"18379","Like so many films consumed with the minutiae of daily journalism, Spotlight is a magnificently nerdy process movie — a tour de force of filing-cabinet cinema, made with absolute assurance that we’ll be held by scene after scene of people talking, taking notes, following tips, hounding sources, poring over records, filling out spreadsheets, and having one door after another slammed in their faces.","90","1895587"
"18380","A film that you can appreciate, but it’s also one that may be difficult to watch. Because it is so course, because it is so authentic, and because the characters are so real, you feel a closeness to Lee that may be uncomfortable.","90","340855"
"18381","Shallow Grave, a tar-black comedy that zings along on a wave of visual and scripting inventiveness.","90","111149"
"18382","Fincher, whose work on ""Fight Club"" and ""Panic Room"" displayed his expertise in melding the suspenseful and the lurid, plays it cool here. He lets his stars do their thing.","90","443706"
"18383","I found myself -- all twitchy intellectualism aside -- liking it enormously. There's more to Stevens's exteriors than those great shots of the looming ranch house. He had learned John Ford's trick of keeping the horizon low in the frame, and there are literally dozens of long, wide shots that are more than merely awesome. They suggest an emptiness that stumbling, ill-educated, materialistic people will somehow fill with something -- oil derricks, bragging Texas talk, reactionary politics. [Reprinted in the NY Times: 25 May 2003, p.21]","90","49261"
"18384","The fact that we experience Travis’s need for an explosion viscerally, and that the explosion itself has the quality of consummation, makes Taxi Driver one of the few truly modern horror films.","90","75314"
"18385","Missing is Mr. Costa-Gavras's most beautifully achieved political melodrama to date, a suspense-thriller of real cinematic style, acted with immense authority by Jack Lemmon, as Charles Horman's father, Ed Horman, and Sissy Spacek as Charles's wife, Beth.","90","84335"
"18386","Louis-Dreyfus and Gandolfini are lovely together, though her character is the sharper-edged of the two. It's Gandolfini's Albert, soft-hearted and soft-bellied, who suffers more. Gandolfini takes the movie's small, offhand jokes and intensifies them.","90","2390361"
"18387","20th Century Women is irreducible, too, although certain adjectives and adverbs do leap to mind: generous, reflective, absolutely delightful.","90","4385888"
"18388","Mamet -- crafts tangy, well-seasoned dialogue that a good cast can feast on. And this cast is prime.","90","252503"
"18389","What sets this film entertainingly apart from most civil-rights sagas, though, are a slew of relaxed, offhandedly persuasive performances, along with the flamboyance of hippie-era San Francisco.","90","1013753"
"18390","The film's both mental and experimental, more melodious than Yentl and at heart as soft and gentle as a Christmas kiss.","90","107688"
"18391","A tale that's so enriching, so heartwarming, so funny, so touching and so breathtaking, you'll wonder why the king of wackiness didn't branch out sooner.","90","319061"
"18392","Along with his writing partner, actor Owen Wilson, who also plays (hilariously) a supporting role in the film, Anderson reveals himself to be a highly original comic talent, impressive both for his strongly controlled deadpan style and for providing a sense of emotional heft lacking in most mainstream film comedies.","90","265666"
"18393","Fred Zinnemann’s superbly sensitive film explores the anti-Nazi awakening in the 1930s of writer Lillian Hellman via persecution of a childhood friend, portrayed in excellent characterization by Vanessa Redgrave in title role. Richard Roth’s production is handsome and tasteful.","90","76245"
"18394","The whole film is unlikely, a joyous story of youth, innocence, sweet earnestness, charming ineptitude and a shaky but productive belief on the hero’s part that he can do anything he pleases.","90","3544112"
"18395","Richard Linklater goes Hollywood (1995) -- triumphantly and with an overall intelligence, sweetness, and romantic simplicity that reminds me of wartime weepies like The Clock.","90","112471"
"18396","Wild Tales is loose-limbed, rowdy, and exhilarating — in its vibrant lunacy, and with its cartoonishly brash violence, it's a little bit Almodóvar, a little bit Tarantino.","90","3011894"
"18397","The acting of the brilliant cast is sometimes superb. But Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is bigger than any of these things. Its real hero is not calfy Jeff Smith, but the things he believes, as embodied in the hero of U. S. democracy's first crisis, Abraham Lincoln.","90","31679"
"18398","While the screenplay for Little Chilldren is basically perfect, it's the acting that really drives the film home.","90","404203"
"18399","Steinfeld is brilliantly able to weave together a character who's both typical and yet surprising in her multidimensional emotions that Nadine slowly works through. She's not a cookie-cutter character.","90","1878870"
"18400","Tully encapsulates the psychological process of maturity with pithy humor and vertiginous insight. Tully’s appearance may have seemed like a magical interlude, but she solidifies Marlo’s reality by exposing the path that led her there.","90","5610554"
"18401","A darkly enjoyable roller-coaster ride -- Clooney and Kaufman deftly interweave the macabre with lightheartedness.","90","270288"
"18402","As it turns out, Mr. Perry, while busily establishing his economic independence, has been finding his voice as a filmmaker. And here, working with fine performers like Ms. Elise, Anika Noni Rose, Phylicia Rashad and Kerry Washington, he sings the song the way he likes it - with force, feeling and tremendous sincerity.","90","1405500"
"18403","Wilder trades Cain's sun-rot imagery for conventional film noir stylings, but the atmosphere of sexual entrapment survives.","90","36775"
"18404","A genuinely affecting movie that approaches its adult themes with intelligence, maturity, and rare authenticity.","90","120686"
"18405","Bob Fosse's remarkable film version of Julian Barry's legit play, Lenny, stars Dustin Hoffman in an outstanding performance.","90","71746"
"18406","There's nothing bogus about this locomotivated follow-up; it's a truly excellent adventure, hilariously inventive, greased-lightning paced and dumb-bunny brilliant.","90","101452"
"18407","I'll just say to anyone lamenting the state of American cinema since the 1970s, if you're curious where the next generation of auteurs is coming from, look in the art houses and look in The Matrix.","90","133093"
"18408","Like its hero, the movie has a blunt, exuberant honesty, pulling off even its false moves with conviction and flair.","90","1125849"
"18409","The sequel is simply a tour-de-force of thriller filmmaking.","90","372183"
"18410","WarGames is a soft-sell protest -- pro- people, anti-nuclear and anti-machine -- that entertains. It peddles neither the hysterics of Jane Fonda's ""China Syndrome"" nor the hopelessness of ""Dr. Strangelove."" It's a war cry for peace that's good to the last byte. [3 June 1983, p.23]","90","86567"
"18411","The picture packs a wonderful wallop.","90","88763"
"18412","Its unique message about laughing in the face of evil clearly reveals that life is beautiful.","90","118799"
"18413","Beautifully acted by Rachel Weisz, Rachel McAdams and Alessandro Nivola as the three points of a melancholy romantic triangle, this is a deeply felt drama that exerts a powerful grip.","90","6108178"
"18414","A dynamic, fully visually realized experience. It's every bit as gory as ""Batman"" but more cohesive and its struggle between good and evil more tightly integrated. [11 Aug 1989, p.C6]","90","97981"
"18415","Out of the elusive, but curiously intoxicating Truman Capote fiction, scenarist George Axelrod has developed a surprisingly moving film, touched up into a stunningly visual motion picture.","90","54698"
"18416","Weird, beguiling premise.","90","120601"
"18417","A cunning and hilarious update of the giant-insect movies of the 1950s.","90","271367"
"18418","It all serves a portrait of 1970 California that mixes absurdity with an air of looming cataclysm, a volatile formula that wouldn’t work without Phoenix’s performance.","90","1791528"
"18419","Some ingenious direction by Alan J. Pakula and scripting by William Goldman remove much of the inherent dramatic lethargy in any story of reporters running down a story.","90","74119"
"18420","Anchored by two outstanding performances from Anthony Hopkins and Jonathan Pryce, the film is a triumph of writing as well as unostentatious filmmaking.","90","8404614"
"18421","This film aspires to be a meditation on (among other things) art, trust, loyalty, politics and popular culture. With utter simplicity, and with unexpectedly intense storytelling, it achieves all that and more.","90","122529"
"18422","Kong is an exaggeration ad absurdum, too vast to be plausible. This makes his actions wholly enjoyable.","90","24216"
"18423","Everywhere the camera turns in this tense and volatile drama, it finds enough interest for a truckload of conventional Hollywood fare. Whatever its limitations, Cop Land has talent to burn.","90","118887"
"18424","The enigma of the planet's history, juggled through Heston's humiliating experience of being studied as an interesting laboratory specimen by his ape captors, right down to his final startling rediscovery of civilisation, is quite beautifully sustained.","90","63442"
"18425","When movie lovers are looking back on the best of 2001, they will still be marveling at the beauty, intelligence and seemingly effortless mastery of Ms. Blanchett's performance.","90","219699"
"18426","Darren Aronofsky wrestles one of scripture's most primal stories to the ground and extracts something vital and audacious, while also pushing some aggressive environmentalism, in Noah.","90","1959490"
"18427","When every aspect of a movie comes together, it's a beautiful sight.","90","5437928"
"18428","The visuals are wild, the sound track has the audacity to underscore the subtext instead of just echoing the obvious, the comedy is irreverent and occasionally slapstick, and the metaphorical details are consistently strong.","90","120188"
"18429","Blanchett makes an indelible impression as a woman who, through breeding, intense personal cultivation and social expectations, has brilliantly mastered the skill of navigating through life.","90","2402927"
"18430","Frozen is a delightful animated musical, a return to form for Disney animation with an intriguing story and terrific songs.","90","2294629"
"18431","There’s raw power in Chomko’s writing, but so much scrupulousness and craft that you feel safe when the time comes to weep.","90","6662736"
"18432","This ""Les Mis"" does make you feel, intensely and sometimes thrillingly, by honoring the emotional core of its source material.","90","1707386"
"18433","His (Soderbergh's) work has taken on echoes of a classier, bygone age of cinema, at once more literate and lighthearted.","90","181865"
"18434","So smartly has del Toro thought his fable through, and so graceful is his grasp of visual rhyme, that to pick holes in it seems mean; yet Pan's Labyrinth is perhaps more dazzling than involving--I was too busy reading its runes and clues, as it were, to be swept away. It is, I suspect, a film to return to, like a country waiting to be explored: a maze of dead ends and new life.","90","457430"
"18435","The confident storytelling and the bravura acting — Daveed Diggs, Toni Collette and John Malkovich contribute compelling caricatures — carry “Buzzsaw” all the way home.","90","7043012"
"18436","Haynes makes it possible to forget all the layers at work and simply be swept up in the story's emotions. As in Sirk's films, these characters live and breathe within the film's exaggerated reality, thanks to rich performances by Haysbert, Quaid, and especially Moore.","90","297884"
"18437","A vivid character study in the tradition of the not dissimilar The Hustler. Marvellous performances throughout ensure interest.","90","59037"
"18438","Donald Sutherland works small and subtly, balancing Jane Fonda's flashy virtuoso technique.","90","67309"
"18439","The German comedy Toni Erdmann makes the best case imaginable for the importance of tone.","90","4048272"
"18440","This weirdly off-kilter suspenser goes well beyond the usual police procedural or killer-on-a-rampage yarn due to a fine script, striking craftsmanship and a masterful performance by Morgan Freeman.","90","114369"
"18441","Filled with tension, deception and bravura acting, Breach is a crackling tale of real-life espionage that doubles as a compelling psychological drama.","90","401997"
"18442","Adroitly directed by Orson Welles, who also plays the star, it is a grade A gooseflesh-raiser.","90","38991"
"18443","Technical elements are among the best this year. Photography, editing, music, production design, and costumes all add seamless period flavor to the puritanical stew that was London almost a half-century ago.","90","1174732"
"18444","Emotionally layered, culturally specific, and frequently hilarious, Crazy Rich is a transportive delight, with food montages to die for (the film offers a splendid showcase of Singapore’s justly celebrated street-food scene) and a wedding processional so exquisite I started crying at its sheer beauty.","90","3104988"
"18445","Crawl is a great example of a simple story exceedingly well-told. It’s a bloody adventure full of teeth-gnawing turns of fortune, mordant wit, vicious gator kills, and surprising tenderness — that clocks in at a blessedly fleet 87 minutes. It’s a perfect horror film for the summer, as much an ode to the cataclysmic, humbling aspects of Mother Nature as it is a love letter to father-daughter relationships.","90","8364368"
"18446","[De Palma] is a superb visual artist, but more important, his visual patterns express the moral dislocations of a troubled society. In Body Double, De Palma has never been more perversely brilliant in his tracking of the pervasive lust -- for sex, for money, for power -- that floats through our culture like some poisoned aerosol of desire. [29 Oct 1984, p.134]","90","86984"
"18447","It is literate, bawdy, sophisticated, sensual, cynical, heart-warming, and disturbingly thought-provoking.","90","68327"
"18448","It’s a great work of the Discover America Seventies.","90","65724"
"18449","Never Look Away makes an eloquent case for art as an expression of hope, a way of searching for meaning in chaos.","90","5311542"
"18450","This is a probing, inquisitive work of a very high order, although it goes a bit slack in the final third and concludes rather conventionally compared to much that has come before.","90","1798709"
"18451","The recent proliferation of gray-haired cinema is a welcome development, but it hasn’t yielded very many notable pictures. “Dreams” doesn’t just buck that trend; it points a new way forward by being frank about living one’s final years and confronting that fact every day.","90","3236120"
"18452","Sings whenever Williams is onscreen.","90","97165"
"18453","As played by Gene Wilder in Mel Brooks's funniest, most cohesive comedy to date, this Dr. Frankenstein is a marvelous addled mixture of young Tom Edison, Winnie-the-Pooh, and your average Playboy reader with a keen appreciation of beautiful bosoms.","90","72431"
"18454","It gradually settles and deepens into something nuanced and moving, a character study that's not so much about aging, specifically, as it is about the great and awful process of getting to know yourself.","90","4270516"
"18455","A remarkably stylish and fascinating space drama.","90","2935510"
"18456","With no shtick to fall back on, Sandler is forced to act, and it’s a glorious thing to watch.","90","5536736"
"18457","This is where Payne shines. Schmidt’s Winnebago journey through America’s heartland is more like a personal voyage into his Heart of Darkness.","90","257360"
"18458","The Kids Are All Right ranks with the most compelling portraits of an American marriage, regardless of sexuality, in film history.","90","842926"
"18459","Lenny Abrahamson's shattering drama Room borrows its fictional plot from the tabloids and strips it of sensationalism.","90","3170832"
"18460","Irresistible, hugely satisfying feminist fairy tale.","90","195685"
"18461","The fact that not every terrible thing can be remedied or appropriately punished is a tough lesson even for adults to learn, but A Monster Calls helps find the sense in it.","90","3416532"
"18462","This one's done right. Here's an intelligent movie with no special effects. You have to pay close attention, to listen hard to its cross-fires of dialogue.","90","114814"
"18463","Triad oozes a confidence that carries the viewer almost without pause to its shocking climax and ironic close.","90","115012"
"18464","Kathryn Bigelow's The Hurt Locker is a grinding, nightmarish machine.","90","887912"
"18465","Remarkable.","90","111161"
"18466","Abel Ferrara's uncompromising Bad Lieutenant is a harrowing journey observing a corrupt NY cop sink into the depths, with an extraordinary and uninhibited performance by Harvey Keitel in the title role.","90","103759"
"18467","Mr. Crichton's previous films as a director — ""Westworld"" and ""Coma"" — are skillful and, each in its own way, entertaining, but they give no hint of the amplitude he displays in this visually dazzling period piece. With Sean Connery as the gang's elegant leader, the sort of mastermind who denies his body nothing, Lesley-Anne Down as his magnificent moll, and Donald Sutherland as his locksmith —""the best screwsman in England"" — The Great Train Robbery is classy entertainment of the sort I associate exclusively with movies.","90","79240"
"18468","The Searchers is more a look at American genocide and racism, and the poison of revenge-obsession, than it is an adventure movie, and it feels like one of the wisest and most mature Westerns on the classics docket.","90","49730"
"18469","I love Jackson's ""Rings"" saga despite his propensity for whimsical animation whenever he tries to strike a chord of dread or menace.","90","167260"
"18470","The writer and director, Asghar Farhadi, has thus created the perfect antithesis of a crunching disaster flick, such as ""2012,"" which was all boom and no ripple.","90","1832382"
"18471","Though not as cleverly original as ""Strangers on a Train"", or as cleverly sexy as ""Notorious"", this is one of Hitchcock's most entertaining American thrillers.","90","53125"
"18472","Sadly, Howard blands out in the final third, using old-age makeup and tear-jerking to turn a tough true story into something easily digestible. Until then, you'll be riveted.","90","268978"
"18473","A wonderful hymn to the last true era when men of substance played pool with a vengeance.","90","54997"
"18474","Crichton keeps the laughs coming with infectious energy.","90","95159"
"18475","Kramer vs. Kramer is a perceptive, touching, intelligent film about one of the raw sores of contemporary America, the dissolution of the family unit.","90","79417"
"18476","A gender-flipped sibling to Crystal Moselle's Skate Kitchen (set in Los Angeles versus that film's NYC), its narrative of sudden belonging and onrushing perils mirrors that Sundance entry. But in emotional punch and shoulda-seen-this-coming skill, it is more like Hill's Lady Bird, a gem that feels simultaneously informed by its author's adolescence and the product of a serious artist's observational distance.","90","5613484"
"18477","Finally, the man (Hanks) has delivered a moving, slightly unhappy, and ultimately hopeful story in which squishy love takes a backseat to the wondrous whirlwind of life. The season's most delightful surprise.","90","162222"
"18478","The movie is full of wonderful little touches: Syndrome, the bad guy, is drawn to remind viewers of ""Heat Miser"" from the classic Christmas cartoon ""The Year Without a Santa Claus.""","90","317705"
"18479","While Cronenberg works, the two other main humans - Boone and his girlfriend, are flat and boring, mostly due to uninspired performances. Still, that's like blasting Star Wars for Mark Hamill's acting. While this isn't as great as Star Wars, it's in the same vein, and if Nightbreed had made some loot, I think we would have gotten some very cool sequels with a fantastic mythology.","90","100260"
"18480","A brilliant, disturbing, but unstable and half-crazy piece of work.","90","147612"
"18481","Labyrinth, a fabulous film about a young girl's journey into womanhood that uses futuristic technology to illuminate a mythic-style tale, is in many ways a remarkable achievement.","90","91369"
"18482","It's a long movie that feels short: It grabs you in early scenes, intense though low-key before all hell breaks loose, then keeps you riveted to its mostly male characters.","90","1291584"
"18483","Constant lateral tracks, push-ins, whip-pans, camera moves timed to dialogue, title cards, chapter headings, miniatures, use of stop-action, fetishization of clothing and props, absurdist predicaments — all the techniques Anderson has honed over the years — are used to pinpoint effect here.","90","2278388"
"18484","To their old fascination with Sunbelt pathology, to their side-winding Steadicam and pristine command of screen space, the Coens have added a robust humor, a plot that keeps outwitting expectations and a surprising dollop of sympathy for their forlorn kidnapers. [23 March 1987]","90","93822"
"18485","What enchants, really, is the relationship between Nick and Nora as they live an eternal cocktail hour, bewailing hangovers that only another little drink will cure, in a marvellous blend of marital familiarity and constant courtship, pixillated fantasy and childlike wonder.","90","25878"
"18486","What truly makes Liar Liar work, however, is Shadyac's inspired sense of comic proportion. While torquing the hilarities to the max, he never loses sight of the story's important human side. His blend of farce with heart is perfect.","90","119528"
"18487","Summer hasn't arrived, but the funniest riff on a summer movie genre has already landed.","90","425112"
"18488","The right word for Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is wondersful -- as in full of wonders, great and small.","90","304141"
"18489","Leonard Schrader adapted the screenplay from the novel by Manuel Puig, and his fearless willingness to explore every corner of human nature serves what is greatest and sweetest in the performances of William Hurt and Raul Julia.","90","89424"
"18490","This isn't just the most riotously inventive movie of the year, it's the raunch anthem of the age.","90","158983"
"18491","Even if the film is mostly hitting familiar notes in terms of story and theme, it expresses a concise, focused and expertly managed vision with which there’s little to quibble, and the extraordinary style represents the fruition of a long-imagined dream on the part of many directors and cinematographers. From now on, when the discussion turns to great works of cinematography and camera operating, 1917 will always have to be high on the list.","90","8579674"
"18492","Without its animation, A Scanner Darkly would have made a fine cautionary tale about drug addiction, paranoia and institutional treachery in a police state. But with a technique that turns the existing live action into a two-dimensional cartoon, the movie goes one -- maybe even 10 -- better. It becomes its own living, breathing metaphor.","90","405296"
"18493","Mississippi Grind itself may be a bit of a throwback to the lived-in, character-driven, landscape-besotted films of the 1970s, but it’s less a pastiche or a homage than the cinematic equivalent of a classic song, expertly covered.","90","2349144"
"18494","A harsh (though slightly toned down from Moody's book), deeply moving, emotionally rich and intelligent film about the difficulty of rebelling against social restrictions--and the inescapable consequences of such attempts when they do succeed--The Ice Storm should not be missed.","90","119349"
"18495","Lee's finest, most unabashed labor of love.","90","104797"
"18496","Succeeds stunningly on its own terms.","90","116209"
"18497","A densely textured moral universe that makes good on his metaphoric title-and in this case, the animals are perfectly willing to eat their young.","90","1313092"
"18498","You will laugh. Then you will laugh some more. Then you will laugh still again.","90","357413"
"18499","Corbet's high-caliber melodrama combines food for thought with sense-blitzing spectacle. Between screaming tantrums and booming anthems, it leaves us with a nagging sense that history never quite repeats itself, but sometimes rhymes. Usually to a thumping disco beat.","90","5960374"
"18500","If necessity is the mother of invention, then DreamWorks’ desire to extend the Dragon franchise has propelled the creative team in the most admirable of directions, resulting in what just may be the mother of all animated sequels.","90","1646971"
"18501","3 Days of the Condor is a classic spy thriller. It remains just as relevant and thrilling today as it did in 1975. It's a film built around political metaphors and pessimism, trends that continue to spiral and evolve throughout our culture even today, with events unfolding that oddly mimic this film's once outlandish plot.","90","73802"
"18502","A smart, realist drama -- I wouldn't be surprised if this one winds up on my 10-best list for '99.","90","144814"
"18503","Just about everything about this film is winning and gratifying.","90","4622512"
"18504","This movie’s strength lies in its gentleness just as its wisdom lies in its willingness to get extravagantly silly. Richard Linklater is one of the best directors going, and Last Flag Flying shows his talents in the full flower of their maturity.","90","6018306"
"18505","Bottom line: It's hilarious, vicious, offensive, thoroughly profane and a joy to watch, just like you'd expect. Be sure to sit through the end credits for a bonus song from Kim Jong-il to Alec Baldwin.","90","372588"
"18506","A deeply felt, deceptively simple film that marks the high point of Mr. Eastwood's directing career thus far.","90","107808"
"18507","A virtuoso piece of kinetic moviemaking. Working with material that could, with a few false steps, have turned into a tony reality-and-illusion puzzle, the director, Richard Rush, has kept it all rowdy and funny -- it's slapstick metaphysics.","90","81568"
"18508","Mr. Pitt moves through this unexpectedly solid thriller with dazzling confidence, showing off all the star power that he usually works overtime to hide.","90","118972"
"18509","Munich's even-handed cry for peace is not an act of equivocation but one of bravery. What Munich has to say, and its ability to say it to the widest possible audience, couldn't be more needed than it is right now.","90","408306"
"18510","Never a dull moment, which, considering the film's length is saying something. [04 Jan 1987, p.6E]","90","52561"
"18511","While it's easy to imagine an infinite number of bad courtroom comedies based on this scenario, this 1992 movie turns out to be wonderful—broad and low character comedy that's solidly imagined and beautifully played.","90","104952"
"18512","[Crowe] knows how to shape a scene and he's never cheap with characterization; adults are permitted to be as complex as their children; a rare event in pictures. [18 May 1989, p.A14(E)]","90","98258"
"18513","Driver ferries Baumbauch’s super-cerebral script — Baumbach could never not be cerebral — to a place beyond thinking, where raw emotion becomes an entropic, hurricane swirl.","90","7653254"
"18514","Cage, who gives a blazing, imposive performance, uses his haunted eyes to reveal the emotional scars that Frank can't heal.","90","163988"
"18515","This gripping crime thriller about hardboiled NY cop Michael Douglas tracking a yakuza hood in Osaka, Japan, boasts magnificent lensing and powerfully baroque production design.","90","96933"
"18516","An ethereal, creepy, almost breathtaking meditation on the life of a mind snapped in two.","90","144084"
"18517","The greatest of all pulp fantasies.","90","17136"
"18518","A pretty damn good summer movie.","90","114898"
"18519","Its terrifying story about death still leaves audiences with much to think about long after the credits roll, and the twists that lead to a new ending are fun to follow. Thirty years after the original movie frightened audiences, its source material has given new life to one of the best Stephen King adaptations in the past decade.","90","837563"
"18520","I haven’t seen a crime thriller this good since L.A. Confidential.","90","385887"
"18521","Drew Goddard's giddily brilliant The Cabin in the Woods has a lot on its twisted mind.","90","1259521"
"18522","A sensationally entertaining old-school freakout and one of the smartest, most viscerally effective thrillers in recent memory.","90","1457767"
"18523","Ingeniously conceived and impressively executed, Pleasantville is a provocative, complex and surprisingly anti-nostalgic parable.","90","120789"
"18524","Some of us knows that there's an American style -- best displayed in the big, smart, kid-friendly epic -- that few other cinemas even aspire to, and none can touch. When it works, as it does here, it rekindles even a cynic's movie love. So cheers to Downey, Favreau and the Iron Man production company. They don't call it Marvel for nothing.","90","371746"
"18525","In his late seventies, Robert Redford has never held the camera as magnificently as he does in the survival-at-sea thriller All Is Lost.","90","2017038"
"18526","An exquisitely realized adaptation of Lionel Shriver's bestselling novel. In a rigorously subtle performance as a woman coping with the horrific damage wrought by her psychopathic son, Tilda Swinton anchors the dialogue-light film with an expressiveness that matches her star turn in ""I Am Love.""","90","1242460"
"18527","The intensity and the lyrical fervor of Kasi Lemmons’s direction lend this historical drama, about Harriet Tubman’s escape from slavery and her work with the Underground Railroad, the exalted energy of secular scripture.","90","4648786"
"18528","Cutting to the emotional core of what social media says about us, the result is as much a time capsule of our relationship to (and reliance upon) modern technology as it is a cutting-edge digital thriller.","90","7668870"
"18529","What makes this movie work is the kind of cool that made Get Shorty go so nicely: an understanding that life's little adventures rarely come in neat three-act packages, the way most movies now do, and the unruffled presentation of outrageously twisted dialogue, characters and situations as if they were the most natural things in the world.","90","120780"
"18530","Mann takes all the instincts he learned as a Miami Vice producer and trims them of their excesses, and the result is an unsettling thriller whose detached style perfectly complements its psychological intensity.","90","91474"
"18531","It was incredible to see what is arguably the best of the Star Wars films, on the big screen again. However, I do not believe that any of the minor changes make the film any better. [Special Edition]","90","80684"
"18532","Much as it owes to Kubrick, Spartacus owes even more to its script, which Scenarist Trumbo has adorned with humor, eloquence, sophistication and a corrosive irony. Above all, despite his personal predilection for the 20th century's most crushing political orthodoxy, Trumbo has imparted to Spartacus a passion for freedom and the men who live and die for it —a passion that transcends all politics and persons in the fearful, final image of the dying gladiator, the revolutionary on the cross.","90","54331"
"18533","A terrifying thriller with a surprisingly warm heart, John Krasinski's A Quiet Place is a monster-movie allegory for parenting in a world gone very, very wrong.","90","6644200"
"18534","Getting full comic effect from its class-comedy abrasions, Philomena rises to poignancy and profundity as Dench reveals her control of a character stained by the loss of her child and troubled by her suspicion.","90","2431286"
"18535","Everett looks at home in this role and breathes new life into Wilde. The Happy Prince proves that Rupert Everett was born to tell the tumultuous story of a kindred spirit. Oscar Wilde would be proud.","90","2404639"
"18536","Of course the film raises more questions than it comes near to answering, but its faults rather pale beside the epic nature of its theme, and Kingsley's performance in the central role is outstanding.","90","83987"
"18537","Is it or is it not stupendously friggin' rad? And the answer is yes. For most of the first hour, a good portion of the second, and even many of the 40 minutes left after that, Avatar is stupendously friggin' rad.","90","499549"
"18538","Exciting, smart and enormously enjoyable.","90","117060"
"18539","Kick-Ass moves with such bloody assurance that you'd be forgiven for not seeing how smart it is. But smart it is. Smart, important and deadly.","90","1250777"
"18540","A first-rate thriller with grit and intrigue to spare.","90","258463"
"18541","Above all else, it lodges itself into one’s brain and seems primed to reward repeat viewings. The biggest compliment I can give Guadagnino is that he’s made a Suspiria that appears destined for the long-lasting cult status already enjoyed by the original.","90","1034415"
"18542","I suppose the perfect ending to the chapter would be to report that The Beaver is a masterpiece. It isn't quite, but it does offer an astonishing and resonant performance by Gibson, who spends most of the movie playing two simultaneous characters, often in the same shot.","90","1321860"
"18543","After a start heavy on exposition, the film strings one action setpiece after another, each realized with the breathless excitement of an adventure pulp cover. It's as if Jackson set out to bring to life every fantasy of the last moment before earth gave way to space as the site of the final frontier.","90","360717"
"18544","With One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Forman takes his rightful place as one of our most creative young directors. His casting is inspired, his sense of milieu is assured, and he could probably wring Academy Award performances from a stone.","90","73486"
"18545","What's most stunning about Raging Bull is the tension between 19th-century melodrama and 20th-century psychodrama, the narrative form brought into being by the conjunction of Freudian theory and the mechanics of the movie camera.","90","81398"
"18546","The heart of Million Dollar Baby lies in the core relationships among Frankie, Maggie and Scrap, friendships so pure, so genuine, so authentic that it takes actors of Eastwood's, Swank's and Freeman's caliber to sell them in this otherwise cynical world.","90","405159"
"18547","Glover, as usual, is phenomenal.","90","310357"
"18548","The real hero here is Joss Whedon, who directs the film with a fanboy's enthusiasm and a thorough knowledge of the genre.","90","848228"
"18549","It’s the human side of the character that makes this McCarthy’s best performance to date, revealing haunting insights into friendship, loneliness, and creative insecurity.","90","4595882"
"18550","Scene after scene is filled with a ferocious strength and humor. Michael Lerner's performance as a Mayer-like studio overlord is sensational.","90","101410"
"18551","For diehard fans, X-Men is full of in jokes and sly references -- For everybody else, there's the thrill of the unknown.","90","120903"
"18552","With craft, crackle, a little bombast and plenty of residual rage, he has created a time-capsule movie that explodes like a frag bomb in the consciousness of America, showing how it was back then, over there.","90","91763"
"18553","Somehow, for all the dollar-book Freud brought to bear on it, the picture comes up fresh, innocent and enchanting whenever you see it.","90","32138"
"18554","An appalling masterpiece.","90","99685"
"18555","Samberg and Milioti are great together.","90","9484998"
"18556","Full of ideas about sexuality - some quite provocative, even a century after their first articulation - but it also recognizes and communicates the erotic power of ideas.","90","1571222"
"18557","It's the most ambitious and impressive Coen film in at least a decade, featuring the flat, sun-blasted landscapes of west Texas -- spectacularly shot by cinematographer Roger Deakins -- and an eerily memorable performance by Javier Bardem, in a Ringo Starr haircut.","90","477348"
"18558","Even the car chase in Fletch is witty and believable and something an adult can attend without flinching. As the adolescent revels of summer wear on, that alone could make it a movie to cherish.","90","89155"
"18559","It's a work of art for sure, but a sadistic one. Oldboy is one of the year's best; it just isn't for everyone. If you're still interested, go for it.","90","364569"
"18560","BlacKkKlansman is a nuanced story of race in America, but Lee doesn’t take any chances with vagueness or ellipses, nor should he. As much as BlacKkKlansman plays with the mechanics of blaxploitation fantasy, it doesn’t leave one with any question about what’s real.","90","7349662"
"18561","As writer and actress, Thompson has all the right Austen rhythms and filmmaker Ang Lee (""Eat Drink Man Woman"") orchestrates with sensitivity and style.","90","114388"
"18562","As action, as allegory, as cinema, The Hunger Games is the best American science-fiction film since ""The Matrix,"" and if Ross and his crew stay with the series for the next two books, we may get that rarest of things: a blockbuster franchise that earns our money through craft, emotion and execution, not merely marketing and effects.","90","1392170"
"18563","The movie is simply luxurious: huge, ornate stage settings; bright, colorful circus like street scenes; gorgeous costumes.","90","86879"
"18564","The Terminator is a splendid meta-monster, Frankensteined for the computer age. And Cameron devises not one, not two but, well, let's call it X climaxes that will melt the hinges of your jaws. [19 Nov 1984, p.132]","90","88247"
"18565","This magnificent stop-motion cartoon is alive - ""it's alive! - with laughs and heart.","90","1142977"
"18566","It's hard enough to find comedies like this at any time, so it's a small and welcome miracle to come upon one in the midst of a typical movie summer.","90","478311"
"18567","Made with uncommon skill and assurance, the film never succumbs to rank sentimentality, but it manages to get at the nuances of human relationships.","90","978759"
"18568","May not hit every note perfectly, but the picture they've come up with is full-bodied and intelligent.","90","783233"

"18570","Bong is back and on brilliant form, but he is unmistakably, roaringly furious, and it registers because the target is so deserving, so enormous, so 2019: Parasite is a tick fat with the bitter blood of class rage.","90","6751668"
"18571","Out of Africa is still an absolute knockout. It provides such an enchanting glimpse of the paradise that Dinesen tragically lost that audiences will completely understand her other grand passion for Africa itself.","90","89755"
"18572","That rarest of independent films -- it's risky and exciting.","90","118749"
"18573","As a good fairy tale should, The Princess Bride teaches but never preaches. It's a lively, fun-loving, but nevertheless epic look at the nature of true love.","90","93779"
"18574","Legrand’s achievement — his integrity, one might say — is that he’s managed to cut to the marrow of the situation while remaining keenly sensitive to how such things play out in the real world.","90","6002232"
"18575","Darren Aronofsky’s churning fever dream mother! is a devouring and restless experience: a creative surge that’s like the lancing of a boil, releasing a torrent of despair and disgust for the greedy chaos of society today as well as a self-loathing portrait of the artist as an emotional succubus.","90","5109784"
"18576","As successful as this family drama is, Demme proves himself to be quite a multitasker. With the skill of an ethnographer and the passion of a sentimentalist, he celebrates the traditions of marriage in a handful of tender set pieces.","90","1084950"

"18579","Meticulously crafted and beautifully performed.","90","250797"
"18580","The musical is as malleable and eclectic a genre as any other, and Chazelle reminds us how effectively it can be applied to intimate moments as well as huge ones.","90","3783958"
"18581","A harrowing World War II epic about the struggle to uphold decency in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds, the visual masterwork finds Spielberg atop his craft, weaving heart-pounding action and gut-wrenching emotion — often during the same sequence — that will leave viewers silently shaken.","90","120815"
"18582","An exquisitely evocative movie that elevates rueful melancholia to a superpower.","90","362270"
"18583","About a billion laughs (though ""Hot Tub"" is not for the faint of heart or anyone even slightly concerned with what's happened to common decency these days).","90","1231587"
"18584","As in all of Wright’s films, the surface is just as satisfying as the subtext: hilarious comedy, compelling character drama, eye-popping visuals, and a juicy science-fiction story.","90","1213663"

"18592","It's an entirely different animal from Tarkovsky's hypnotic but opaque take, and it's an entirely different animal from most studio product in general -- Soderbergh's Solaris is a gorgeous and deceptively minimalist cinematic tone poem.","90","307479"
"18593","A mature work of meticulously tuned meta-fiction.","90","8291806"
"18594","Gleeson is one of the finest actors we have, and in casting him as the lead, McDonagh stacks the deck so that regardless of our own religious reservations, we're forced to care about Father James as a man.","90","2234003"

"18597","No film with an ambition this large, and achievement this impressive, can be anything but exhilarating, a vital affirmation of the creative process.","90","383028"
"18598","Ari Aster directs slowly, meditatively, purging the film of any of the usual horror-video razzmatazz. Instead, he creates scary coherent spaces for the audience to sink into.","90","7784604"
"18599","It's both a perceptive dual character study and, that rarity of rarities, a large-scale action movie for grown-ups, one worth leaving the house for.","90","1979320"
"18600","Mimic is undoubtedly the best mutant-cockroach horror thriller ever made. Even granting that there hasn't been much competition, this is intended as a high compliment.","90","119675"
"18601","The Saint works. The reason why it occasionally soars is Kilmer, an actor who’s happiest when burying himself in eccentric characterizations, a trick he performs repeatedly here even as he fills the screen with pure movie-star dazzle.","90","120053"
"18602","Coogler and company do fine work convincing us against our better judgment that nothing we see is preordained, that anything can happen within the four corners of the ring. You can't ask a ""Rocky"" film to do more than that.","90","3076658"
"18603","Excellent performances; fascinating film.","90","71970"

"18608","Robocop is as tightly worked as a film can be, not a moment or line wasted.","90","93870"
"18609","It is not a film the memory of which you will exactly wish to cherish. You may even, like me, reject the glib and icy pessimism of its message. But you will, I can assure you, find it difficult to put out of mind.","90","66921"

"18614","Zaillian tells it with warmth, humor and zest. The cast is first-rate. Laurence Fishburne plays the rather underdeveloped role of Vinnie, Josh's other teacher, a speed-chess hustler with a more instinctive approach to the game than Pandolfini. Joan Allen is Josh's protective mother, determined to see that his childhood isn't stolen by the monastic demands of the game. Best of all is young Pomeranc, a chess whiz with no previous acting experience. [30 Aug 1993, p.52]","90","108065"
"18615","Patton is a war movie of unusual depth and a landmark in screen biographies.","90","66206"
"18616","One regrets the pounding Muzak of Tangerine Dream, but this is on the whole a striking directorial debut, at once scary and erotic, with lots of sidelong touches in the casting, direction, and script .","90","93605"
"18617","Beyond its craftiness and impeccable craft, the film sparks a warm connection with the viewer. Like a smiling cavalier swinging into view to rescue an imperiled maiden, The Artist brings salvation to melancholy movie lovers. For here is that rare film indeed that offers pleasure beyond words.","90","1655442"
"18618","All About Eve is probably Hollywood's closest original approach to the bite, sheen and wisdom of high comedy. It crackles with smart, smarting dialogue. Sometimes at too earnest length, but mostly with wit and always with insight, it jabs at the quirks and follies of show business and its ""concentrated gatherings of neurotics, egomaniacs, emotional misfits and precocious children."" It matches some penetrating characterizations with top-drawer acting. With all these merits, plus a full-blooded story, the picture is absorbing enough to ride over an occasional lag, satisfying enough to redeem a contrived epilogue.","90","42192"
"18619","[Wiig's] great, but the film's in the pocket of Powley's rib-high corduroys from the second she struts onscreen — and long after she takes them off.","90","3172532"
"18620","t's a movie for adults -- if they can keep up with its careering pace -- and, yes, you can take the kids. It juggles a '90s impudence with the old Disney swank and heart.","90","103639"
"18621","Even though there are tedious stretches with less-than-riveting characters, the film gradually pulls you into its claustrophobic spell and becomes acutely suspenseful in its final half-hour.","90","123755"
"18622","Nothing tops ILYPM's Jim Carrey ... in the most gloriously raunchy, unrepentant moment in the an(n)als of Hollywood A-listers doing gay-for-pay.","90","1045772"
"18623","It deserves praise not as a polemic but as a richly humanistic, emotionally searing drama that sticks in the memory.","90","7008872"
"18624","Get On Up isn't a perfect-picture; there are moments of awkwardness, little gambles that don't quite pay off. But it's one of those experiments that's both flawed and amazing, a mainstream movie (with Mick Jagger as one of its producers) that fulfills old-fashioned, entertainment-value requirements, even as it throws off flashes of insight.","90","2473602"
"18625","""E.T."" is as contemporary as laser-beam technology, but it's full of the timeless longings expressed in children's literature of all eras.","90","83866"

"18627","Impeccably crafted and utterly impersonal, Lasse Hallstrom's adaptation of John Irving's novel has many of the qualities Oscar is known to appreciate.","90","124315"
"18628","George C. Scott as the fiery Pentagon general who seizes on the crisis as a means to argue for total annihilation of Russia offers a top performance, one of the best in the film. Odd as it may seem in this backdrop, he displays a fine comedy touch.","90","57012"
"18629","It's gleefully bold, visually adventurous, often funny, strikingly concise — the whole heart-pounding tale is over in 90 minutes — and 100% entertaining.","90","2872732"
"18630","This is rapture in pictures. [22 December 1997, p. 81]","90","119485"
"18631","I think that the power and the theme of the film lie in the fact that while some characters are more “major” than others, they are all subordinated to the music itself. It’s like a river, running through the film, running through their life. They contribute to it, are united for a time, lose out, die out, but the music, as the last scene suggests, continues.","90","73440"
"18632","Reconfirms Tarantino's status as the master of pop cinema and puts a sense of excitement into the year. He has matched, if not eclipsed, the power and scope of 1994's ""Pulp Fiction,"" though not its human charm.","90","266697"
"18633","Happily, then, the first movie of the Harry Potter series casts a splendid spell, as screenwriter Steve Kloves has transcribed J.K. Rowling's novel nearly to a T, with precious little tweaked or trimmed.","90","241527"
"18634","This incredible but true story marks the first time Eastwood's signature themes have found expression in a woman's experience, and the absence of any distracting machismo only heightens his sense of helpless rage at the perpetual anguish of victims' families.","90","824747"
"18635","Martha Marcy May Marlene enters so richly into psychological horror it recalls those disturbing dramatizations of Jonestown that were big on TV in the '80s.","90","1441326"
"18636","The Rover might not be about anything at all, but the dust it stirs up sticks to you after you leave the theater.","90","2345737"
"18637","Lord and Miller do great work within constraints, taking pre-made pieces and fashioning them into feats worthy of applause. It's no wonder they made a Lego movie — and it's no wonder it's so good.","90","1490017"
"18638","Citizen Kane does occasionally sink to dullness because of its reiterations, notwithstanding it can be classified as, in a number of aspects, one of the most arresting pictures ever produced.","90","33467"
"18639","Luhrmann has raised the level of his game, deconstructing the Hollywood musical -- a genre all but left for dead -- and reassembling it with a potency that hasn’t been seen since “Cabaret.”","90","203009"
"18640","One truly, madly, deeply satisfying creep-out.","90","265349"
"18641","District 9 whizzes by with a resourcefulness and mordant wit nearly worthy of its obvious influences: ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"" ""Dawn of the Dead,"" and ""Starship Troopers.""","90","1136608"
"18642","Believe us, that secret is so clever, even though it is devilishly far-fetched, that we wouldn't want to risk at all disturbing your inevitable enjoyment of the film.","90","52357"
"18643","This exquisitely beautiful adaptation of Yann Martel's castaway saga has a sui generis quality that's never less than beguiling, even if its fable-like construction and impeccable artistry come up a bit short in terms of truly gripping, elemental drama.","90","454876"
"18644","The acting in the film is grade-A, with Stallone bringing the more mumbled Rocky from the first film spliced with some rousing inspirational monologues when the moment is right (not forced, not preachy… just perfect).","90","479143"
"18645","Let other directors play with toy soldiers and computer effects. This is big-time, old-school filmmaking. Dunkirk isn’t overdone. It’s simply done epically...But it’s also human. It has room for small acts of heroism, of kindness, of forgiveness. And for a single, simple important, timeless message of resilience: Take what comes. Do what you can. Never surrender.","90","5013056"
"18646","Boasting a pitch perfect voice cast led by a terrific Ginnifer Goodwin as a righteous rural rabbit who becomes the first cotton-tailed police recruit in the mammal-centric city of Zootopia, the 3D caper expertly combines keen wit with a gentle, and very timely, message of inclusivity and empowerment.","90","2948356"
"18647","The movie's stroke of sheer genius is its wondrous ending.","90","285742"
"18648","Like all the best fairy-tales, the film is purely sensual, irrational, fuelled by an immense joy in story-telling, and totally lucid. It's also a true original, with the most beautiful visual effects to emerge from Britain in years.","90","87075"
"18649","In Peggy Sue Got Married, Francis Coppola takes a familiar, sitcomish premise -- the one about a grown woman who time-travels back to her high-school days -- and invests it with rich and surprising colors. Imagine a paint-by-numbers comic book put in the hands of a Rembrandt; the bold comic outlines remain, but the subject is transformed by the dark palette and subtle brushwork into a tale reverberating with complex, adult emotions. [6 Oct 1986, p.73]","90","91738"
"18650","Brilliant study of hero-worship and bloody-minded individualism centering on doomed outsider Paul Newman, jailed on a minor charge, bullied by guards, and winning the respect of fellow convicts on a southern chain gang. Superb cast, unforgettable moments. [29 Nov 2009, p.29]","90","61512"
"18651","The most exciting thing about Jackie Brown is the director's seamless transition to a less flashy, revealing style; it's well-suited to the more character-oriented focus of the film... an assured, accomplished, and very good film.","90","119396"
"18652","The very good news is that, in addition to stylistic innovation, the film sports a provocative and appealing story that's every bit the equal of this technical achievement.","90","114709"
"18653","Far more than Norman's adventure, which takes him from home to a cemetery and deep into his town's history, what pulls you in, quickening your pulse and widening your eyes, are the myriad visual enchantments - from the rich, nubby tactility of his clothes to the skull-and-bones adorning his bedroom wallpaper.","90","1623288"
"18654","The difficulty of humanizing killers without romanticizing them may present a challenging problem, but Malick showed it’s not impossible to solve.","90","69762"
"18655","Eighth Grade” shines as, like, a totally spot-on, you know, portrait of Millennial angst and stuff. That may be how Kayla (and all her peers) talk...but Burnham shows a sociolinguist’s ear for the cadence and flow of 21st-century girl-speak, and Fisher...delivers his dialogue so naturally, you’d swear she’s making it up as she goes along.","90","7014006"
"18656","Brandishing an ambition it's likely no film, including this one, could entirely fulfill, The Tree of Life is nonetheless a singular work, an impressionistic metaphysical inquiry into mankind's place in the grand scheme of things that releases waves of insights amid its narrative imprecisions.","90","478304"
"18657","Mitchell’s deft handling of the relationships in It Follows gets threaded into an ingenious and exceedingly skillful creepshow.","90","3235888"
"18658","Battleship Potemkin is first and foremost an action drama, a work of straightforward emotion and pulse-quickening tension.","90","15648"
"18659","The result is one of Sayles' best films. The music, a mix of blues, seminal rock and newcomer Gary Clark Jr.'s performance, will be an obvious draw, as will the performances by some leading African-American actors.","90","829193"
"18660","Seek this one out though, because it's too unique and too defiantly strange to survive for long in today's Darwinian and consumerist exhibition environment.","90","2125435"
"18661","This hugely entertaining thriller is what's needed to banish a winter-long case of movie blues.","90","488120"
"18662","Rarely has so scary a thriller been so well made, and never has digital video -- by the English cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle -- been put to grittier use.","90","289043"
"18663","Jones gets everything--the gestures, the generosity, the mean streak, the bending of the ear to recitals of woe, whether across a lunch table or a prison cell. He even nails the voice, like that of a chorister caught running a racket with the incense.","90","420609"
"18664","Eastwood is at his effortless, slyboots best and the film is as preposterous as it is delightful.","90","118548"
"18665","Kaufman and King somehow give felt puppets an independence they might otherwise have lacked. How? The magic of movies, I guess. Or, more likely, the magic of Kaufman’s mind.","90","2401878"
"18666","Brutal and precision-made, Thief is a high-tech crime movie that closes in on its subject with such relentless purpose that it approaches abstraction. Nothing enters Mann's frame that is not designed to be there: the expertise he honors in his criminal hero is mirrored by his own meticulous craftsmanship. He gets the job done--and blows you away while doing it. [30 Mar 1981, p.82]","90","83190"
"18667","McKay approaches this adaptation of Michael Lewis’ book with wit, energy and a surprising degree of clarity. But if the movie is a crackerjack entertainment, it’s one with a conscience.","90","1596363"
"18668","Guadagnino does a remarkable job of capturing the tension and anxiety that comes with not only first love, but first-time queer romances.","90","5726616"
"18669","Through his art and passion, Stone makes JFK plausible, and turns his thesis of a coup d'etat into fodder for renewed debate.","90","102138"
"18670","To pull this kind of thing off you need exceptional performances, and the two leads rise commandingly to the challenge. Wilson, best known for his work in the screen version of ""The Phantom of the Opera"" and HBO's ""Angels in America,"" keeps his true colors effectively muted throughout the bulk of their face-off, but it is Page who astonishes.","90","424136"
"18671","What's truly surprising about Happy Feet is not its giddily brilliant entertainment, its intimate knowledge of the culture or its toe-tapping music. It's how commonplace these qualities have become in computer-animated movies… Happy Feet may be just one of the crowd, but what a great crowd it is.","90","366548"
"18672","It is the interplay between Wasikowska and Eisenberg that gives ""The Double"" both its tension and its charm... Their struggle captivates, the resolution shocks, and you can't help but wonder what windmills Ayoade will tilt next.","90","1825157"
"18673","The film at its simplest serves as a cautionary tale, but it also functions as a meditation on how little it takes to redirect a life by choice or by chance.","90","307901"
"18674","A slick job of movie hoodwinking with a thoroughly implausible romance, set in a frame of wild adventure that is as whopping as its tale of off-beat love. And the main tone and character of it are in the area of the well-disguised spoof...Mr. Huston merits credit for putting this fantastic tale on a level of sly, polite kidding and generally keeping it there, while going about the happy business of engineering excitement and visual thrills.","90","43265"
"18675","Not just a ripping yarn but a powerful, poignant coming-of-age story.","90","373889"
"18676","Skillfully adapted from Tim Tharp's novel, evocatively lensed in the working-class neighborhoods of Athens, Ga., and tenderly acted by Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley, this bittersweet ode to the moment of childhood's end builds quietly to a pitch-perfect finale.","90","1714206"
"18677","It takes about an hour after it's over for the heart to slow, the brain to recalibrate, and the nonsensicalness of the thing to sink in.","90","493464"
"18678","Paxton's Dad may be the most terrifying father to appear in a horror film since Jack Nicholson went crazily homicidal in ""The Shining.""","90","264616"
"18679","It's unmissable, flaws and all, because riveting suspense spiced with diabolical laughs and garnished with a sprig of kinky romance add up to the tastiest dish around.","90","212985"
"18680","Fukunaga has made his Jane Eyre an intimate, thoughtful epic, anchored by strong lead performances and the gorgeous, moody 100-shades-of-gray cinematography of Adriano Goldman.","90","1229822"
"18681","It's like reading a fairy tale that has the mixture of happiness and trauma to set your imagination whirling; the fire-breathing dragon--scaly, winged, huge--is more mysterious, probably, than any we could have imagined for ourselves.","90","82288"
"18682","It's like visual rock, and it's bursting with energy. The action runs from night until dawn, and most of it is in crisp, bright Day-Glo colors against the terrifying New York blackness; the figures stand out like a jukebox in a dark bar. There's a night-blooming, psychedelic shine to the whole baroque movie.","90","80120"
"18683","If you come to this expecting the philosophical depth and psychological detail of Tolstoy’s work you’re sure to be disappointed, but as an actors’ romp it’s delectable.","90","824758"
"18684","Sure, the territory is not exactly fresh...but the chemistry between the two leads is so explosive yet assured, and the comic timing so perfect, that the cliches are given new life.","90","122933"
"18685","Dark, dangerous and a great deal of wicked, amoral fun. A film that manages to be as clever, playful and mock violent as its title, Lock, Stock was a major hit in its native Britain and its cheeky tone, simultaneously calculated and off the cuff, is as hip as anyone could want. [5 Mar 1999]","90","120735"
"18686","Aronofsky's ability to capture the rush and confusion of racing down a timeline toward infinity, only to suddenly slam into a dead end, makes for impressive and occasionally disturbing stuff.","90","138704"
"18687","Essentially, this is a film about existential emptiness, and yet it’s beautiful and alive, as filled with humor as it is with melancholy.","90","3416744"
"18688","An unleashed Raimi may be a more exciting moviemaker, but there's something to be said for the virtues of a good story well told, which describes A Simple Plan down to its last shivery snowflake.","90","120324"
"18689","A Serious Man is not only hauntingly original, it’s the final piece of the puzzle that is the Coens. Combine suburban alienation, philosophical inquiry, moral seriousness, a mixture of respect for and utter indifference to Torah, and, finally, a ton of dope, and you get one of the most remarkable oeuvres in modern film.","90","1019452"
"18690","There's more to everyone here than we're initially led to think. The Good Girl is like a neurotically charged post-millennial take on the trailer-park comedies that Jonathan Demme once claimed for himself.","90","279113"
"18691","It is tough, bleak, brutally intense, and genuinely scary - not in the cutesy cathartic way of most horror films, but in a way that makes you ponder the nature of existence and leaves you with a pit in your stomach.","90","2798920"
"18692","Damsels in Distress is deliberately and purposefully irrelevant; its irrelevance is its strength. It's zany-in-quotation-marks and also flat-out zany. I laughed until I cried, and you may too (if you don't find it pointless and teeth-grindingly irritating). Either way, Whit Stillman is back at last, bringing his peculiar brand of counterprogramming refreshment to our jaded age.","90","1667307"
"18693","The skillful Patrick Marber (Closer) adapted this gripping drama from a novel by Zoe Heller, and it's both literate and urgently plotted, with a voice-over from Dench that cuts like broken glass.","90","465551"
"18694","Chillingly hilarious.","90","88846"
"18695","The movie is realistic enough to make all corporate climbers, but especially men over 50, quake in their boots. If you are what you do, what are you if you're no longer doing it?","90","1172991"
"18696","A blood-chilling dark comedy with unexpected moments of both fury and warmth, a strange, brooding and very accomplished film that sets us back on our heels from its opening frames.","90","169547"
"18697","For all its flaws, In the Bedroom is an unusual accomplishment, a serious drama about violence and morality that plays out with a fatalistic intensity somewhere between Greek tragedy and film noir.","90","247425"
"18698","Mr. Krokidas deftly shows how the ambition to write is entangled with other impulses.","90","1311071"
"18699","The Love Witch is an expertly executed homage that works brilliantly on its own original terms.","90","3908142"
"18700","Franco, who’s absolutely hysterical as the brooding, deluded Wiseau, leads a parade of familiar faces...delivering a winning, Ed Wood-esque blend of comedy and pathos that could very well earn its own cult status.","90","3521126"
"18701","It has an uncommonly strong ensemble cast...but the movie belongs to Mr. Trintignant.","90","5304464"
"18702","It's a magnificent achievement—holes, tatters, crudities, screw-ups, and all.","90","217505"
"18703","A work of artistry and craftsmanship at the highest level.","90","241303"
"18704","Its look has the same grudging beauty that, once you get used to it, English weather does: It's so defiant in its grayness that you come to appreciate its conviction.","90","330373"
"18705","A breakthrough comedy, a four-square piece of populist fun that ranks as quite possibly the best mainstream American comedy in years-at least since ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin.""","90","1478338"
"18706","This is the Mickey Mouse factory at its finest, with inventive animation, stirring music and a pride of inspired, almost-human animals.","90","110357"
"18707","A performance like De Niro's, in a well-made entertainment like Midnight Run, is cheap at any price. And capable of restoring the audience's faith in the form. [25 July 1988]","90","95631"
"18708","Walt would be proud.","90","120910"
"18709","An old-house thriller retrofitted for the 21st century without any touch of unneeded flash, Panic Room is scary enough to do for downtown living what Jaws did for beaches.","90","258000"
"18710","Never Let Me Go is that rare find, a fragile little four-leaf clover of a movie that's emotionally devastating, yet all too easily trampled by cynics.","90","1334260"
"18711","The best surprise in A Fantastic Woman might be how lived-in Marina’s existence feels despite the tenuousness of her housing, her romantic fulfillment, and her legal rights.","90","5639354"
"18712","A critic-proof movie if there ever was one: it isn't all that good, but somehow it's great.","90","31381"
"18713","All in all, Pirates of the Caribbean is the best spectacle of the summer: the absence of pomp is a relief, the warmth of the comedy a pleasure. [28 July 2003, p.94]","90","325980"
"18714","From the clockwork comic timing to the movie's salty mix of the ridiculous and the reflective, This Is the End is stupidly hysterical and smartly heretical. Cross my heart and hope to die, it's funny as hell.","90","1245492"
"18715","The drama flows gorgeously and, unlike in many other franchises in which entries keep getting longer every time out, this one is served up without an ounce of fat. It provides all the tension and action the mainstream audience could want, along with a good deal more.","90","2316204"
"18716","Only Lovers Left Alive accomplishes the neat trick of reinventing a moribund genre as a distinctly Jarmuschian hangout movie.","90","1714915"
"18717","Even when Conspiracy Theory is jammed or rushed or overly jittery, Gibson's command--of Jerry's fractured psyche, his freak perceptions, and his ardor--gives the picture blue-eyed soul.","90","118883"
"18718","There is no denying the emotional force that this film develops, and for that, we can credit talented filmmakers and two stars working at the height of their powers.","90","5711148"
"18719","This first English-language outing by the ever-adventurous French director Jacques Audiard (A Prophet, Rust and Bone) is a connoisseur’s delight, as it's boisterously acted and detailed down to its last bit of shirt stitching.","90","4971344"
"18720","Before and after everything else, Honey Boy — James’s nickname for his son — is a movie worth seeing for its distinctive qualities, but it must also have been worth doing for its therapeutic effect. Filming well is the best revenge.","90","8151874"
"18721","The director, Tobe Hooper, who honed his scary craft on such films as ''The Texas Chain Saw Massacre'' and ''Poltergeist,'' knows how to construct a horror film so it builds to a screaming pitch. He shoots many of his images from below, to give the view a child might have, and deftly manipulates the audience to feel the growing menace. He is helped by an excellent cast.","90","91276"
"18722","Though While We’re Young is primarily a comedy — and a very funny one at that, managing to be both blisteringly of-the-moment and classically zany in the same breath — Baumbach has bitten off several serious topics, for which laughter serves as the most agreeable way to engage.","90","1791682"
"18723","Invigorating.","90","79100"
"18724","In the recent flood of superhero movies, several have managed to be quite good — but Wonder Woman ranks as one of the few great ones.","90","451279"
"18725","Parents may not approve of this dark, violent 1981 children's film, which is what makes it such a good one. The film is resolutely, passionately antiadult, yet much of the humor has an adult sophistication and edge to it; this is one kids' movie that doesn't condescend.","90","81633"
"18726","No movie can convey the truth of war to those of us who have not lived through it, but The Messenger, precisely by acknowledging just how hard it is to live with that truth, manages to bring it at least partway home.","90","790712"
"18727","The movie absolutely delivers on the sheer moment-to-moment pleasures fans have come to expect, from dynamite dialogue to powder-keg confrontations.","90","3460252"
"18728","Beautiful Girls is always in touch with reality but never drowned in it. [19 February 1996, p.64]","90","115639"
"18729","There are no surprises in Sleepless, and the audience is ahead of the characters every step of the way. But people seem to like it that way. And, hey, it works like a charm.","90","108160"
"18730","A riot from start to finish, Carrey's first feature comedy is as cheerfully bawdy as it is idiotically inventive.","90","109040"
"18731","Isn't much more than marvelous entertainment -- but then, that's a lot right there.","90","280707"
"18732","Gibson has made a big, bold, nightmarishly beautiful film not just about the dawn of the Christian faith, but about the awful tendency of human communities (wherever and whenever in the world they may exist) toward self-preservation, intolerance and mob rule.","90","335345"
"18733","Finely made and richly satisfying film.","90","765429"
"18734","The true allure of Titanic is its invitation to swoon at a scale of epic moviemaking that is all but obsolete.","90","120338"
"18735","Like Woody Allen's ""Take The Money and Run"", The Jerk is basically designed to allow Martin to use as many of his standup jokes and routines as possible, but his charm and timing makes this cleverly constructed movie seem fantastically loose and easy.","90","79367"
"18736","A smart, lively and unpretentious exploitation picture...Consistently funny and clever.","90","133751"
"18737","A melodramatic journey from coast to coast shows Hitchcock at his best. It gives movement, distance and a terrifying casualness to his painful suspense.","90","35279"
"18738","Judged, though, as the action extravaganza it means to be, Rise of the Planet of the Apes wins high marks for originality, and takes top honors for spectacle.","90","1318514"
"18739","An acrobatic, larkish globetrotting adventure about paintings and psychotherapy that defies easy categorization save inclusion on any adult animation fan’s must-see list, its slinky, colorful pleasures and wittily referential joie de vivre are like a lifeline in a season when the art house is typically beholden to severe, award-seeking bids to depress you.","90","6241872"
"18740","Very beautiful and the first truly interesting, American-made western in years.","90","65214"
"18741","Lawrence, in this movie, shows you what true screen stardom is all about. She cues each scene to a different mood, leaving the audience in a dangling state of discovery. We’re on her side, but more than that we’re in her head. Even when (of course) we’re being played.","90","2873282"
"18742","The special power of Eastwood's achievement is that, save for one indelible moment, the mutual recognition between sworn adversaries happens not on-screen, but later, as we piece the two films together in our minds.","90","498380"
"18743","Every supremely controlled stylistic element of Zhang Yimou’s breathtakingly beautiful Shadow is an echo of another, a motif repeated, a pattern recurring in a fractionally different way each time.","90","6864046"
"18744","A chilly, fascinating thriller at odds with itself.","90","1598778"
"18745","The latest furiously paced, perversely entertaining ""Pulp Fiction"" for puppies.","90","139239"
"18746","It’s a film that aches with beauty. It cries with longing. It quakes with a rich sadness that lingers with you long after the final moments. A masterpiece of poetic filmmaking, Moonlight is one of the most powerful films of the year.","90","4975722"
"18747","Writer Aaron Sorkin, director Danny Boyle and star Michael Fassbender have given their subject the brilliant, maddening, ingeniously designed and monstrously self-aggrandizing movie he deserves.","90","2080374"
"18748","This exuberant satire of Hollywood in the late 20s, at the time of the transition from silents to talkies, is probably the most enjoyable of all American movie musicals.","90","45152"
"18749","It says something about Paul Greengrass' directing style that he's able to make a movie as fresh and frank as The Bourne Ultimatum from a genre as moldy and bombastic as the spy thriller.","90","440963"
"18750","A frightening and consistently inventive horror story... It's busy on the surface and empty in the center, but somehow it works.","90","69995"
"18751","Mawkishness is kept at bay by the lightness of touch in Ashby's direction and Gordon and Cort's wonderful performances. Only the most miserable cynic could resist its unique charm and ultimate hopefulness.","90","67185"
"18752","Drugstore Cowboy, an electrifying movie without one misstep or one conventional moment. [11 Oct 1989]","90","97240"
"18753","What ""The Big Chill"" was to baby boomers, the inspirational sex, lies, and videotape is to the mall crowd. It's designer soul-searching, a looking glass for a generation.","90","98724"
"18754","Scarface is the most stylish and provocative - and maybe the most vicious - serious film about the American underworld since Francis Ford Coppola's ""Godfather.""","90","86250"
"18755","The director has wisely assembled an ensemble of performers who know how to handle a long take; this will certainly rank among Keaton's career highlights — in a role that allows him to completely dump out his paintbox and show a vast range of emotion — but everyone shines.","90","2562232"
"18756","Star Trek goes back to the legend's roots with a boldness that brings a fatigued franchise back to life.","90","796366"
"18757","When the movie just sits with the characters on front porches or in backyards, Mackenzie's generous, hands-off approach with his actors — most of the conversation scenes play out in long takes with minimal camera movement — yields poignant rewards.","90","2582782"
"18758","Despite its p.c., humanistic overtones, the film manages to integrate the humor and action of a kid’s adventure tale and the message of a political allegory without beingheavy-handed.","90","129167"
"18759","No deep solutions are suggested in this subtle and meticulously observed study. Yet Director Norman Jewison has used his camera to extract a certain rough-cut beauty from each protagonist. He has shown, furthermore, that men can join hands out of fear and hatred and shape from base emotions something identifiable as a kind of love. In this he is immeasurably helped by performances from Steiger and Poitier that break brilliantly with black-white stereotype.","90","61811"
"18760","Lyrical, original, misshapen and deeply felt, this is one flawed beauty of a movie.","90","421715"
"18761","All of the key creative personnel contribute to the movie's nail-biting tension and unexpectedly moving finale. Jon Harris's editing is matchless, and Rahman's score effectively heightens the emotion. Ultimately, however, it is the talents of Boyle and Franco that sock this movie home.","90","1542344"
"18762","The Marx Brothers in their greatest movie.","90","23969"
"18763","Like the great space epics of the past, Christopher Nolan’s Interstellar distills terrestrial anxieties and aspirations into a potent pop parable, a mirror of the mood down here on Earth.","90","816692"
"18764","An exquisite, almost sensual grief suffuses every frame of A Single Man.","90","1315981"
"18765","It's irresistible.","90","125439"
"18766","Those more devoted to the genre can debate whether Matthew Vaughn's Kingsman is the best comic-book movie of the last few years. What's beyond argument, however, is that Vaughn has whipped up the most interesting one, the only to make ferocious, unsettling art out of the great contradiction of superheroic fantasy: jolly do-goodism and its brutalizing sadism.","90","2802144"
"18767","A flashy, nasty triumph","90","203119"
"18768","Things worked out between Joe and Valerie, and for their real-life models, who are now the subjects of a terrifically entertaining movie. But that does not mean that justice was done, or that truth prevailed.","90","977855"
"18769","This is a beautifully crafted and special movie to cherish, one likely to stay with you long after most of the so-called summer blockbusters have faded into memory.","90","817177"
"18770","In his bigscreen feature debut, director and co-writer Jonathan Mostow displays real flair for visceral cinema while adroitly sidestepping many of the usual tripwires of this sort of film, particularly silly coincidences, stupid decisions on the part of characters with whom you're supposed to identify, and superheroics performed by ordinary people.","90","118771"
"18771","A delightful and delicate comic fable.","90","99487"
"18772","At first and final glance, Poltergeist is simply a riveting demonstration of the movies' power to scare the sophistication out of any viewer. It creates honest thrills within the confines of a P.G. rating and reaches for standard shock effects and the forced suspension of disbelief only at the climax, when we realize that the characters are behaving with such obtuseness precisely because they are trapped inside a horror movie.","90","84516"
"18773","Yet even with those slightly different chords, Ross manages to pluck the right heartstrings, in the process delivering a grade-A tear-jerker.","90","112571"
"18774","Suffice to say, unrelenting material like this isn't for everybody. That it is a gloriously filmic gesture - by turns jaw-dropping, elusive, silly, obnoxious, painful and beautiful - is celebration enough.","90","1191111"
"18775","Gosling's performance is a small miracle, not only because he's so completely open as a man who's essentially shut off, but because he changes and grows so imperceptibly before our eyes.","90","805564"
"18776","Perhaps the nature of the story is such that the film can’t help but be obvious and quite melodramatic at times, but it gets better as it goes along and builds to a moving finish.","90","2024544"
"18777","It eases up on you, lazy as a cloud, and carries you off in a mood of exquisite delight. To borrow W.P. Kinsella's phrase, it has the thrill of the grass.","90","94812"
"18778","Julieta is a timeless and mature examination of femininity and guilt that marks a return to form for director Pedro Almodóvar.","90","4326444"
"18779","If the film has a problem, it's a kind of excess of goodness at the expense of imaginative excitement. The real hero is the psychiatrist, played with a riffing Jewish beat by Hirsch as a counterpoint to the tight Wasp rhythms of Conrad's family. There's a feeling of therapy more than revelation, but perhaps for our multifariously sick society therapy has become revelation. This seems to have been a major point in Guest's novel, and Redford has dramatized it with integrity, honor and compassion. [22 Sept 1980, p.76]","90","81283"
"18780","Even as it properly foregrounds Wilson’s dialogue — few playwrights have approached his genius for turning workaday vernacular into poetry — Fences is much more than a filmed reading. Mr. Washington has wisely resisted the temptation to force a lot of unnecessary cinema on the play.","90","2671706"
"18781","A solemn, subtly structured, beautifully acted and ultimately hypnotic movie.","90","120255"
"18782","The tension is rooted in psychology rather than gimmickry, and evinces a command of craft that feels old-fashioned in the most refreshing possible sense.","90","1179933"
"18783","Takes a premise that, in less competent, less empathetic hands, would have had the depth of a pancake, gives it a soul and turns it into a surprisingly sweet and funny ode to male friendship and middle-aged love.","90","405422"
"18784","A delicious throwback to the all-star whodunit, this juicy comedy thriller is a treat from start to finish.","90","8946378"
"18785","Marshall masterfully plays our strings without becoming either melodramatic or maudlin. Like Brian De Palma's ""Bonfire of the Vanities,"" hers is an adaptation that ends with a wake-up call, only here it's done successfully and in context.","90","99077"
"18786","Massively inventive, Wonder Boys is spiked with fresh, perverse humor that flows naturally from the straight-faced playing.","90","185014"
"18787","It's a dramatic tale loaded with all manner of dynamics, political and personal, and Spielberg charges out of the gate at a brisk clip, extends his hand and all but enjoins the viewer to grab hold and be swept along for the ride.","90","6294822"
"18788","Considerable intelligence and strategic finesse have been brought to bear on this handsomely mounted adaptation of Michael Cunningham's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, which was hardly a natural for the bigscreen.","90","274558"
"18789","A riveting genre blend of thriller, domestic drama and supernatural horror propelled by a brilliant lead performance.","90","1675192"
"18790","Waititi masterfully balances the film’s comedy with the seriousness of the subject. He plays with your emotions to heighten the impact of the story’s message. Nothing in this film feels gratuitous and the tonal shift in the film will hit you like a ton of bricks.","90","2584384"
"18791","Funny and smart, full of biting humor and astute observations about identity and history, Cheryl Dunye's audacious, joyous debut feature captures the process of falling hopelessly in love with the movies.","90","118125"
"18792","Todd Phillips is no artist, but his lowbrow comedies (Road Trip, Old School) always hit the mark because they're so psychologically true: the superego tries to control the id, but the id gets drunk and barfs all over it. Hilarious.","90","1119646"
"18793","A remarkable study of poverty, family and personal responsibility, The Florida Project meticulously illustrates how life on the margins affects one impressionable six-year-old.","90","5649144"
"18794","Elegantly witty and haunting . . . McKellen gives the performance of his career . . . and Brendan Fraser excels.","90","120684"
"18795","One reason filmmakers like Mr. Nolfi seem attracted to Philip K. Dick's work, beyond the brilliance of its ideas, is that his unembellished writing style leaves them room to make the stories visually their own.","90","1385826"
"18796","A charming, witty, passionate romantic drama about a love transcending space and time, Somewhere In Time is an old-fashioned film in the best sense of that term. Which means it's carefully crafted, civilized in its sensibilities, and interested more in characterization than in shock effects.","90","81534"
"18797","It might be the scariest movie ever made.","90","185937"
"18798","A fluent, intelligent piece of work whose sex and violence are anything but gratuitous, and exactly the kind of highly personal, no-holds-barred vision of life on the ragged edge that independents always aspire to but rarely have the goods to achieve.","90","180093"
"18799","The director mixes moods with a playfulness that is both brazen and carefree and yet precisely modulated, yielding results that amplify the specific content of the screenplay. This makes for a film that, however cheap it was to make, is incredibly rich to watch.","90","2347569"
"18800","The ending of Jacob's Ladder, when it finally arrives, is, like much of the film, both quaint and devastating.","90","99871"
"18801","May be the best independent horror film to have come out since ""The Blair Witch Project."" It's certainly better than ""Blair Witch"", and more fun, more gruesome, and more macabre. In a very delightful way.","90","387564"
"18802","Something we haven't seen before: a manic-depressive romantic comedy that aspires to the soul of a musical. It's a new-fashioned love song.","90","272338"
"18803","Lincoln is too sharply focused to deserve the pejorative ""biopic"" label. It's splendid enough to make me wish Spielberg would make a ""prequel"" to this instead of another Indiana Jones picture.","90","443272"
"18804","A deeply reflective, quietly powerful work that is as timely as it is moving.","90","478134"
"18805","Under Jonathan Demme's masterful cinematic surgery, we get into Lecter's twisted skull and, through this outrageous descent, we come to see this sinister in the everyday.","90","102926"
"18806","This musical about a plant that craves blood has a smart and snappy score -- and Steve Martin in a hilarious bit as a dentist who gives himself laughing gas as he treats his unanesthetized patients. [23 Dec 1986, p.1]","90","91419"
"18807","In keeping with the Smith rules, the movie is irreverent, self-referential, twisted, cheap and tasteless. And, of course, I mean that as the highest compliment.","90","261392"
"18808","While The Dark Knight Rises raises the dramatic stakes considerably, at least in terms of its potential body count, it doesn't have its predecessor's breathless sense of menace or its demonic showmanship, and with the exception of one audacious sleight-of-hand twist, the story can at times seem more complicated than intricate.","90","1345836"
"18809","The Fault in Our Stars may not show the true messiness of cancer, but it does grapple with death and the ability to survive great loss. Maybe that's enough truth for one movie.","90","2582846"
"18810","Ultimately, McCabe and Mrs Miller shapes up as a half baked masterpiece with a kind of gutsy gradeur. It's personal as all-get-out, and I thought that's what everyone had been screaming for all these years. [08 Jul 1971, p.49]","90","67411"
"18811","Physically it is a kick in the teeth, a depiction of poverty, sex and violence which crosses most known codes of acceptability.","90","2053425"
"18812","Not only brutal but also brutally funny, Gone Girl mixes top-notch suspenseful storytelling with the kind of razor-edged wit that slashes so quick and clean you're still watching the blade go past before you notice you're bleeding.","90","2267998"
"18813","Its sharp writing and essential credibility make this small, intimate tale fresh and involving.","90","2063781"
"18814","Glorious, a colossus of rousing action and ferocious fun.","90","172495"
"18815","Though much of the acting attention in Danish Girl will understandably go to Redmayne, Vikander's position as the audience surrogate plus her energy and passion as Gerda, a woman facing an exceptional challenge to her love of her husband, is more than essential.","90","810819"
"18816","Blockers, on the surface, sticks very much to the formula — even the prom setting is very been there, done that. But it’s subversive in these little details, and the resolution is genuinely touching. The best part is that Cannon doesn’t have to sacrifice any of the laughs to get there.","90","2531344"
"18817","Bold, inventive, sustained adrenaline rush of a movie.","90","137523"
"18818","It miraculously pulled off the effect of feeling like a surprise: The picture both fulfilled some vague, unexpressed hopes I didn't know I had and also left me with the sense that I'd just seen something I wasn't quite prepared for -- the kind of contradiction that great showmanship can bridge.","90","367882"
"18819","Escape from the Planet of the Apes is an excellent film, almost as good as the original Planet of the Apes. Arthur Jacobs’ production is marked by an outstanding script, using some of the original Pierre Boulle novel characters; excellent direction by Don Taylor; and superior performances from a cast headed by encoring Roddy McDowall and Kim Hunter.","90","67065"
"18820","The Rider is a rare gem, a small, acutely observed portrait of a few lives on what used to be the frontier but is now a desolate backwater, the windswept badlands around Pine Ridge, South Dakota.","90","6217608"
"18821","For all of its social, political and cinematic significance, Dog Day Afternoon is a terrifically entertaining and emotionally devastating film to boot.","90","72890"
"18822","Doesn't have the purity, the sense of discovery, of the first Toy Story, but it's still an utter delight. Its images and gags keep replaying themselves in the mind well after the film is over.","90","120363"
"18823","First-rate agitprop about the ruthlessness of South African apartheid, directed by Euzhan Palcy (Sugar Cane Alley) and adapted from Andre Brink's novel by Palcy and Colin Welland. The relentless plot is effectively set up and expertly pursued, and Hugh Masekela makes some striking contributions to Dave Grusin's musical score.","90","97243"
"18824","His sumptuous film is as strange and mesmerizing as it is imaginatively ghastly. It's a sophisticated, spookily intense rendering of Ms. Rice's story.","90","110148"
"18825","It would be difficult to describe Martin Scorsese's fine new film, The King of Comedy, as an absolute joy. It's very funny, and it ends on a high note that was, for me, both a total surprise and completely satisfying. Yet it's also bristly, sometimes manic to the edge of lunacy and, along the way, terrifying.","90","85794"
"18826","An unconventional biopic about a brilliant young pianist.","90","117631"
"18827","A rivetingly suspenseful drama that deftly intertwines elements of ticking-clock thriller and tragic farce.","90","2057392"
"18828","Simultaneously an art film and a crime film, Mann's latest work may not give you a ton to hang on to emotionally, but the beauty and skill of the filmmaking keep you tightly in its grasp.","90","1152836"
"18829","In a world of movies that try far too hard to move, entertain and dazzle us, the artistry of Hustle & Flow lies in the way it waits for us to come to it. We can walk as slowly as we want, but sooner or later, it's going to get us.","90","410097"
"18830","Ultra-violent and ultra-stylish, Drive stands out in this year's Cannes competition for its calculated, hard-edged brilliance.","90","780504"
"18831","As bustling and impassioned as the best Sturges and Capra movies, this one captures both the purposeful edginess of Administration Pooh-Bahs (Martin Sheen, Michael J. Fox, David Paymer and Samantha Mathis--nice jobs, all) and the isolation of the President. [20 Nov 1995, p.117]","90","112346"
"18832","By the time of the closing shot -- twists of fog rising like spectres from a leaden sea -- even the most stubborn viewer will be lying back in a state of happy hypnosis. [16 December 2002, p. 106]","90","318034"
"18833","T3 delivers the goods. A hard-hitting, straight-ahead sci-fi actioner with none of the pretentions and ponderousness that have put at least a portion of the public off of ""The Matrix Reloaded"" and ""Hulk.""","90","181852"
"18834","It's definitely an enchanting spectacular for Potter fans anxious to ride the Hogwarts Express toward a new year of magic and mischief.","90","295297"
"18835","As you watch the movie, its central idea — that Jeffrey Dahmer wasn’t just born, he was made; that he started off as an actual human being — has a shocking validity that never undercuts the extremity of his crimes.","90","2291540"
"18836","Phantom Thread is classical and deliberate, with few of his former signatures like ostentatious flourishes of camera, editing, or music. That may frustrate some Anderson fans, but Phantom Thread’s luxurious but restrained aesthetic perfectly matches Reynolds Woodcock’s approach to design.","90","5776858"
"18837","Argo is a crackerjack political thriller told with intelligence, great period detail and a surprising amount of nutty humor for a serious look at the Iran hostage crisis of 1979-81.","90","1024648"
"18838","Compared with the novel, the movie might seem predictable. But compared with other movies, it stands alone.","90","115964"
"18839","Something not seen in movie theaters for a long time: an intelligent, modern screwball comedy, a minor classic on the order of competent, fast-talking curve balls about deception and greed like Mitchell Leisen's ""Easy Living"" and Billy Wilder's ""Major and the Minor.""","90","138524"
"18840","It’s engrossing every inch of the way, with casualties, infighting, character flaws, war mongering, and some delicious grandstanding from Harrelson.","90","3450958"
"18841","Coffin and Renaud's execution is fresh, sincere, often lovely and a great deal of fun -- and in this kind of movie, and this kind of movie summer, execution is everything.","90","1323594"
"18842","Molly’s Game delivers one of the screen’s great female parts — a dense, dynamic, compulsively entertaining affair, whose central role makes stunning use of Chastain’s stratospheric talent.","90","4209788"
"18843","Bridge of Spies is a consummate professional's tribute to a gifted amateur, a smooth entertainment with a strong but subtle political subtext that's both potent and unexpected.","90","3682448"
"18844","The first great film of 2005.","90","366627"
"18845","Prisoners can at times be a hard film to watch, but thanks to all the talent involved, it’s even harder to shake off.","90","1392214"
"18846","In a summer of remakes, reboots and sequels comes Inception, easily the most original movie idea in ages.","90","1375666"
"18847","The film uses the cutting edge of technology to take viewers to the far reaches of the human experience, but also to create a sense of empathy, of investing in the life of another person. It’s a remarkably complex film, but an admirably simple one, too.","90","1454468"
"18848","Ira Sachs’ Little Men is a little movie brimming with little truths about modern life. It won’t change the world, but it does understand it","90","4919484"
"18849","It's a terrific movie. I love the look and the verve of the thing, the confidence of its epic design, its smart use of half a dozen noted British thesps, lending weight and wit to the supporting roles.","90","434409"
"18850","The film's strength is that it sustains an intimate and realistic tone. Mr. Fishburne, who is called upon to deliver several lectures, manages to do so with enormous dignity and grace, and makes Furious a compelling role model, someone on whom the whole film easily pivots.","90","101507"
"18851","It’s not just one of the best superhero movies ever – it’s a damn-fine cinematic representation of the human condition in all its agonizing forms.","90","3315342"
"18852","What makes the film so powerful is both the sympathy it extends towards all the characters (including the seemingly callous parents) and the precise expressionism of Ray's direction. His use of light, space and motion is continually at the service of the characters' emotions, while the trio that Dean, Wood and Mineo form as a refuge from society is explicitly depicted as an 'alternative family'. Still the best of the youth movies.","90","48545"
"18853","Truly, this is manna from hell.","90","1127180"
"18854","Among the considerable achievements of Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter is the fact that the film remains intense, powerful and fascinating for more than three hours.","90","77416"
"18855","It's a stunningly impressive piece of work, typically (for Penn) deriving much of its power from the performances.","90","56241"
"18856","In her first feature, writer-director Gina Prince-Bythewood tells a familiar tale with first-rate acting and an underlying sense of authenticity.","90","199725"
"18857","Glorious vision of youth and truth, love and loss, your name is Mud.","90","1935179"
"18858","That rare sequel that took its time -- 23 years -- so it not only advances a story but also has something new to say.","90","1027718"
"18859","Is Fiennes miscast? Perhaps. He's a high-strung, somewhat clammy actor--not the first to spring to mind for this warmly self-effacing plodder. But he's remarkably fine.","90","387131"
"18860","Allen joins the Catskills tummler’s anything-for-a-laugh antics with a Eurocentric art-house self-awareness and a psychoanalytic obsession with baring his sexual desires and frustrations, romantic disasters, and neurotic inhibitions. It’s a mark of Allen’s artistic intuition and confessional probity that he lets Diane Keaton’s epoch-defining performance run away with the movie and allows her character to run away from him.","90","75686"
"18861","Will keep you awake, jittery and perched on the edge of your seat for pretty much the entire flight.","90","421239"
"18862","Above all a cracking good yarn that earns its laughter, its wonder and its tears.","90","120689"
"18863","Mann has done something transformative with Farrell: The Irish actor has never had this much charisma and natural authority in a role, and as he navigates that gray area between Crockett's real identity and his fabricated one, revealing subtle fissures in the character's cocksure facade, he's fascinating to watch.","90","430357"
"18864","Oldman is the least inhibited actor of his generation, and as this deranged detective, he keeps absolutely nothing in reserve.","90","110413"
"18865","Steadily engrossing and devilishly funny, and, o brother, does it look sharp.","90","243133"
"18866","Jonah Hill is masterful at delivering an absurd story with so much sweetness, the nonsense ceases to get in the way.","90","1232829"
"18867","Since Belfort and his crew are complete knuckleheads, every bit the low-class slobs who bray like animals on the trading floor, The Wolf Of Wall Street may be the funniest film of 2013, rife with gross misbehavior, pranks, and tomfoolery.","90","993846"
"18868","A movie that demands our surrender -- to its energy, to its bold-stroke moviemaking, to its acting (particularly by Cruise and Watanabe, who blend musing and graceful muscularity) and, above all, to its romantic vision of a lost world.","90","325710"
"18869","It's a beautiful, reflective film even as it is also a brutal, visceral one.","90","4196450"
"18870","Takes the prize. It's a bloody hoot.","90","365748"
"18871","Raimi offers all the fantasy, camp and hardcore horror you devoured in the comics. You can feel the pen-and-ink drawings coming to life. Dipping wittily into myth, the macabre and the modern, it's an effervescent adventure that's as amusing as it is genuinely gripping. [19 Feb 1993, Weekend, p.n38]","90","106308"
"18872","Persistently upends expectations without insult, as it pulls you into a netherworld filled with yearning, whimsy, and danger. [15 Dec 1992, p.A16(E)]","90","104036"
"18873","On a par with Bridges' acting, and a sine qua non for Crazy Heart's success, is the excellent music he sings.","90","1263670"
"18874","An exciting, fun and sensationally entertaining movie for everyone.","90","892769"
"18875","Snowpiercer has been brought to the screen with the kind of solid narrative craftsmanship, carefully drawn characters and — above all — respect for the audience’s intelligence rarely encountered in high-concept genre cinema.","90","1706620"
"18876","The extraordinary achievement of Under The Skin is that while Laura develops some human qualities, Glazer resists the temptation to turn this alien’s story into the story of what it means to be human.","90","1441395"
"18877","Larraín’s highly varied visual invention and command of complex structure serve as a reminder of how vitally an imaginative director can skew what otherwise might have emerged in more mainstream colours.","90","1619029"
"18878","Having earned his stripes by directing a few TV episodes, Frakes makes an auspicious debut as a feature filmmaker, sustaining excitement and maintaining clarity as he dashes through a two-track storyline.","90","117731"
"18879","A superb ensemble cast makes the most of the comedy's numerous detours and storylines.","90","1570728"
"18880","Sticking close to the enduring classic's template while injecting plenty of freshness to give the follow-up its own distinct repro vitality, this lovingly crafted production delivers both nostalgia and novelty.","90","5028340"
"18881","Let the unsettling secrets of this outrageously funny and steadily engrossing meditation on the life of two high school misfits after graduation catch you by surprise. It's that good.","90","162346"
"18882","While the film continues almost throughout to generate great whoops of shocking laughter, it's the notes of genuine sorrow, compassion and contrition that resonate.","90","5027774"
"18883","Something seldom seen: an original romantic comedy.","90","1022603"
"18884","The movie itself is a miracle: tough, smart, relentless, provocative and, above all, serious.","90","315733"
"18885","Reitman keeps a strong grip on all the aspects of the story to prevent it from becoming corny, unduly melodramatic or obvious.","90","1967545"
"18886","Though it cannot regain the brash originality of ''Raiders of the Lost Ark,'' in its own way 'The Last Crusade' is nearly as good, matching its audience's wildest hopes.","90","97576"
"18887","An exhilarating two hours of serious fun.","90","121765"
"18888","Until its final stumble, this intelligence thriller, starring Val Kilmer, is charged with brilliance.","90","360009"
"18889","With their inspired, absurdist taste for weird, peculiar Americana-but a sort of neo-Americana that is entirely invented-the Coens have defined and mastered their own bizarre subgenre.","90","118715"
"18890","It has got an intriguing premise, an effective cast, and it has been expertly mounted.","90","82340"
"18891","Starman provides him with a role that, played by anyone else, might seem preposterous. In Mr. Bridges' hands it becomes the occasion for a sweetly affecting characterization - a fine showcase for the actor's blend of grace, precision and seemingly offhanded charm.","90","88172"
"18892","The Peanut Butter Falcon refuses to condescend to its star and tells a story that’s authentic to the life and experiences of adults with Down Syndrome.","90","4364194"
"18893","Blessed is the go-for-it movie that can make room for dissonances and weirdness.","90","1606392"
"18894","The Cronenberg trademarks are here in full force, including an outrageous sexual suggestiveness in his bizarre special effects.","90","120907"
"18895","Anton Corbijn's The American looks and feels like a movie made by a filmmaker who hasn't been to the movies since the '70s - and I mean that as the highest compliment.","90","1440728"
"18896","Max von Sydow gives a performance of a high order as the knight who returns from the Crusades to find his country at the mercy of plague and witch hunts.","90","50976"
"18897","Remember the shitty crime comedies every Hollywood brat tried to make after ""Pulp Fiction""? It took an Irish playwright to get it right. See it with an audience.","90","1931533"
"18898","Kazan succeeds in producing a shrewd piece of screen journalism, a melodrama in the grand manner of Public Enemy and Little Caesar. But he fails to do anything more serious—largely because he tries too hard. In searching for the general meaning in little lives, Director Kazan has trained his lens down fine on small events; he has too often watched his characters through the magnifying glass of special prejudice—the old sentimental prejudice that ordinary people are wonderful no matter what they do.","90","47296"
"18899","Fabulous mental escape. It's fun and playful, rather than dark and foreboding. And there doesn't seem to be an original cyber-bone in the movie's body. But it's put together in a fabulous package.","90","343818"
"18900","It may take a while to acclimate to the film’s off-kilter rhythms and strange happenings — not unlike the film’s protagonist, an outsider entering the forbidding Alaskan wilderness — but Saulnier has crafted his most mature effort to date, mixing his love for pulp fiction with a sombre examination of the inexplicable evil all around us.","90","5057140"
"18901","The movie contains Jane Fonda's first big-screen appearance since On Golden Pond (1981); if she doesn't quite find a character in Martha, she is nonetheless riveting. Anne Bancroft, too, is impressive. Finally, though, it is Meg Tilly who makes the movie live. Her performance, which works on both realistic and symbolic levels, allows you to believe in the story.","90","88683"
"18902","All I can say about Timberlake's performance as the thoroughly odious, desperately seductive, textbook-case metrosexual Parker is that he brings so much reptilian fun that he unbalances the movie, almost fatally.","90","1285016"
"18903","But where most rugged he-man films feature a few action sequences scattered throughout, director Renny Harlin keeps the adventure stuff in this reputed $ 65 million production coming at an astonishing pace.","90","106582"
"18904","So entertaining, so flip and so genially irreverent that it seems to announce the return of the great gregarious film maker whose ""Nashville"" remains one of the classics of the 1970's.","90","105151"
"18905","Richard Linklater's satirical take on high school life in the 1970s is not only funny and entertaining. It's practically a historic document of life during the smiley-face button era.","90","106677"
"18906","It’s indeed a beautiful film, one that will surely convince doubters that Muller is one of the cinema’s best cameramen. He gives the story a surface polish that hints of Edward Hopper and Georgia O’Keefe Americana paintings. Some images are positively breathtaking.","90","87884"
"18907","It is a dark, spellbinding dream, full of murmurs and whispers, byzantine plots and messianic fevers. It finds its iconography of the future deep in the past. It's not always easy to follow, but it's even harder to get out of your system. For better and for worse, it takes more artistic chances than any major American movie around. [10 Dec 1984, p.93]","90","87182"
"18908","Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn never lets up, continually introducing new characters and adding new thrills and chills right up to the last frame… A terrific trip, although admittedly not one that everybody would enjoy taking. [13 Mar 1987, Calendar, p.6-14]","90","92991"
"18909","All in all, Nurse Betty is a wonderful movie, unpredictably alive to the fact that the American citizenry is a lot stranger than we like to admit.","90","171580"
"18910","The Chicago locations are well used by veteran director George Roy Hill, and the wonderful 30s movie style (lots of horizontal and vertical wipes, flipping screens, irises in and out) enhances the sense of good, harmless, nostalgic fun.","90","70735"
"18911","Gets most of its legs from the acting and the dialogue, which has such a rhythmic grace that scenes from the movie can be played and replayed with no loss of thump.","90","104348"
"18912","Once the stardust settles and the generations of ""Star Trek"" fans pass in judgment, this splendid production may emerge as the best movie to date inspired by the multiple-series TV phenomenon created by the late Gene Roddenberry. [15 Nov. 1994]","90","111280"
"18913","Grade-A pulp fiction. This erotically charged thriller about the search for an ice-pick murderer in San Francisco rivets attention through its sleek style, attractive cast doing and thinking kinky things, and story, which is as weirdly implausible as it is intensely visceral.","90","103772"
"18914","This is not ""E.T.,"" nor is it a kid's film nor even necessarily a major mass-audience film, although Spielberg's name, high public anticipation and the child-oriented campaign will make it perform like one.","90","212720"
"18915","This is intensely physical filmmaking, drenched in Florida sunshine and magnetized by the beauty of the actors’ faces and bodies. But it is also deeply rooted in its characters’ consciousness, alert to the feelings of dread, shame, rage and despair that threaten to bring these fast-moving lives to a standstill.","90","8652728"
"18916","A brilliantly executed film that, like many real-life family reunions, is alternately painful, funny, and moving.","90","757361"
"18917","The movie is anything but combative. Pariah is a tender, sporadically goofy, yet candid examination of emergent identity, a film whose lack of attitude sets it apart from much of the hard-bitten, thug-life storytelling that's dominated African-American cinema for decades.","90","1233334"
"18918","Tim Burton, plus Alice, plus 3D equals an unforgettable, one-of-a-kind movie experience. It will clean up.","90","1014759"
"18919","But Bad Santa does feature one last turn from the late John Ritter as a twittery department-store manager (his name, Mr. Chipeska, is a stroke of brilliance that I still can't quite put my finger on).","90","307987"
"18920","Burton, bless him, constricts the space and concentrates the melodrama; he finds the perfect balance between the funereal and the ferocious. Above all, he treasures these ghouls: He digs both their bloodlust and their melancholy.","90","408236"
"18921","Both a landmark and some sort of masterpiece.","90","40636"
"18922","The movie has two virtues essential to good pop thrillers. First, it plugs uncomplicatedly into lurking anxieties -- in this case the ones we brush aside when we daily surrender ourselves to mass transit in a world where the loonies are everywhere. Second, it is executed with panache and utter conviction.","90","111257"
"18923","Creed II is a terrific movie, a boxing picture full of inspired sweetness and shrewd science that honors the cherished traditions of the genre while feeling like something new and exciting in the world.","90","6343314"
"18924","It takes real intelligence to make the best dumb jokes. Game Night has plenty of both, combining skilled filmmaking and ridiculous gags in equal measure, and letting the seriousness and silliness play off of each other for maximum effect.","90","2704998"
"18925","The gloom of random, meaningless existence has rarely been so much fun, and Mr. Allen's bite has never been so sharp, or so deep. A movie this good is no laughing matter.","90","416320"
"18926","There is so much packed in here; Wonderstruck is simultaneously the densest and loosest film Haynes has made. And, like many stories based on books for children, much of it makes more emotional than logical sense.","90","5208216"
"18927","Observe and Report is the rare ""action-comedy"" (almost always a muddled hybrid) that earns its cathartic climax. The blood is real because the psychosis is real. But somehow--the magic of comedy--it's also uproarious.","90","1197628"
"18928","Cameron's achievement isn't only technical. He's using all the not-so-cheap thrills of a violent genre to make a movie with an antiviolence message, and the wonder of T2 is that he pulls it off without looking silly.","90","103064"
"18929","One of the best films seen in many years about the mysterious workings of time and memory.","90","165854"
"18930","The result is as grim and unyielding a depiction of the Holocaust as has yet been made on that cinematically overworked subject — a masterful exercise in narrative deprivation and sensory overload that recasts familiar horrors in daringly existential terms.","90","3808342"
"18931","Joltingly violent, wickedly funny and rivetingly erotic, David Lynch's Wild at Heart [based on the novel by Barry Gifford] is a rollercoaster ride to redemption through an American gothic heart of darkness.","90","100935"
"18932","It works its magic with such exuberance and passion that the film's length becomes a part of its fun.","90","169102"
"18933","Terrifically entertaining specimen of Spielbergian sci-fi, incomparably better than ""A.I."" and as dark a movie as the director has made since ""Schindler's List.""","90","181689"
"18934","Consistently beautiful and often exciting -- despite some dead passages here and there, it's surely the best big-budget fantasy movie in years. [24 & 31 Dec 2001, p. 126]","90","120737"
"18935","Downsizing is an ingenious comedy of scale, a touching tale of a man whose problems grow bigger as he gets smaller, and an earnest environmental parable.","90","1389072"
"18936","The film is striking, at times even piercing, for the way it infiltrates some universal realities of marriage.","90","2980516"
"18937","Four excellent lead performances, vividly evoked ambience and a masterfully sustained mood of quiet desperation mark Sydney as an impressive piece of work.","90","119256"
"18938","Bringing a tough, astringent wit to a subject too often wrapped in the cozy blanket of sentimentality or cute humor, Tamara Jenkins takes a frank look at the indignities of aging in The Savages, a black comedy that invites viewers to laugh or at least smile ruefully at the dying of the light.","90","775529"
"18939","A diverting mix of insight and spectacle, human and superhuman. This machine is built for kids, but rarely do words like ""noble,"" ""Hollywood"" and ""rawkin'"" all apply to one movie.","90","290334"
"18940","Ryan O'Neal's excellent performance captures the shallow opportunism endemic to the title character who is brought down as much by his own flaws as by the mores of the ordered social structure of 18th-century England. Casting, concept and execution are all superb.","90","72684"
"18941","A simple, solid, deeply affecting film.","90","2258858"
"18942","This is a brutal, exhausting, and genuinely horrifying little ghost flick.","90","1179904"
"18943","Hal Ashby has the deftness to keep us conscious of the whirring pleasures of the carnal-farce structure and yet to give it free play. This was the most virtuoso example of sophisticated, kaleidoscopic face that American moviemakers had yet come up with; frivolous and funny, it carries a sense of heedless activity, of a craze of dissatisfaction.","90","73692"
"18944","Expert story construction and compelling thesping and direction make all the narrative elements pay off as if calculated by a precision instrument in which all the parts are working perfectly.","90","104257"
"18945","The best kind of genre filmmaking: It plays by the rules, obeys the traditions and is both familiar and fresh at once.","90","369339"
"18946","Thrillers don't get much smarter than The Interpreter.","90","373926"
"18947","A handsome and fully imagined work of cautionary futuristic fiction.","90","119177"
"18948","The disturbing ideas it plants in the soil of the soul need time and darkness ? not light ? to germinate.","90","120863"
"18949","A bit much? Yes, but it's meant to be. Like Doctor No and From Russia with Love, the two previous Bond bombshells, this picture is a thriller exuberantly travestied. No doubt Goldfinger's formula for box-office gold contains entirely too much brass, but who cares? In scene after scene Director Guy Hamilton has contrived some hilariously horrible sight gags.","90","58150"
"18950","When the film moves out of the paranoiac realm and into action, the violence is deeply satisfying, the twists delightful.","90","5052448"
"18951","The spell that it casts is bright, dreamy and absorbing, but it is also in no particular hurry to come into focus, which makes its aftereffects all the harder to shake.","90","8772262"
"18952","Perhaps the most likable of all Westerns, and a Grand Hotel-on-wheels movie that has just about everything--adventure, romance, chivalry--and all of it very simple and traditional.","90","31971"
"18953","Moonstruck isn't heartfelt; it's an honest contrivance – the mockery is a giddy homage to our desire for grand passion. With its special lushness, it's a rose-tinted black comedy. [25 Jan 1988, p.99]","90","93565"
"18954","We've seen it all before, most recently in ""Gardens of Stone,"" most romantically in ""An Officer and a Gentleman,"" but never more elegantly than here as Kubrick sustains the athletic ballet of obstacle courses and white-glove inspections for a breathtaking 40 minutes.","90","93058"
"18955","Disturbing because it is so believable, Kids goes well beyond any previous American film in frankly describing the lives of at least a certain group of modern teenagers.","90","113540"
"18956","The necessity of circumstances dictates everything anyone does here and you can only react with varying degrees of outrage, anger, disgust, pity, empathy and, if you're a blind optimist, hope for something better.","90","1365050"
"18957","The writing-directing team of brothers Larry and Andi Wachowski has chosen as its filmmaking debut a tightly constructed, stylishly (but rarely self-consciously) executed, gripping little noir parable that couldn't be more firmly grounded in American movie tradition if the filmmakers created a wacky romantic farce about mismatched paramours.","90","115736"
"18958","Nicholson is near-perfect as he slowly allows callous cruelty to give way to vulnerability in one of the most original, idiosynchratic roles of the year.","90","119822"
"18959","Roeg revels in the hallucinatory, creating a wilderness that exists as much in the mind as it does the land.","90","67959"
"18960","The cutting is so sinuous and breathtaking, the music (by Danny Elfman after too much coffee) so onrushing and the camera so penetrative of the depths and heights of midtown Manhattan at cloud level, that the illusion, despite its artificiality, works. You don't believe it but you ""believe"" it.","90","316654"
"18961","Shrewdly conceived, confidently executed and outrageously entertaining.","90","232500"
"18962","The film might have ended at its action-packed and ultimately moving climax, but screenwriter Steve Kloves goes one step farther. He finds the perfect cliffhanger, one that emphasizes just how dangerous young Mr. Potter's situation really is and definitely leaves the audience anxious for the next chapter.","90","926084"
"18963","So genuinely, viciously funny you can't help laughing -- even when you feel really bad about yourself for doing so.","90","157503"
"18964","The acting is uniformly terrific, just a marvel to watch.","90","1431181"
"18965","I never would have believed it, but Branagh gets the balance between pageantry and silliness just right.","90","800369"
"18966","Though it certainly has faults, which only the extremely nostalgic could ignore, the film bests its contemporaries through its ability to unite childlike comedy and adult concerns without ever obscuring one with the other.","90","106611"
"18967","Scabrous, brutal and hip, Trainspotting is a ""Clockwork Orange"" for the '90s.","90","117951"
"18968","Reteaming pop-savvy scribe Diablo Cody with ""Juno"" director Jason Reitman, Young Adult revels in breaking the rules of safe Hollywood storytelling.","90","1625346"
"18969","Chazelle proves an exceptional builder of scenes, crafting loaded, need-to-succeed moments that grab our attention and hold it tight.","90","2582802"

"18971","Still a marvel of verve and bone-dry wit, the movie has been treated kindly by time.","90","58182"
"18972","Though it is all about mourning and loss, Maoz’ script reaches way beyond, unveiling in each one of his leading characters deep layers of past guilt that might have never been revealed in normal circumstances.","90","6896536"
"18973","The writer-director's typically eccentric sixth feature is a sustained immersion in a series of hypnotic moods and longueurs, an imposing picture that thrillingly and sometimes maddeningly refuses to conform to expectations.","90","1560747"
"18974","The performances and presences of Voight and Hoffman are so extraordinarily affecting that their scenes together generate more emotional power than the dramatic wiring of their relationship deserves. [29 May 1969, p.47]","90","64665"
"18975","Hancock suggests new visual directions and emotional tonalities for pop. It's by far the most enjoyable big movie of the summer.","90","448157"
"18976","Monty Python and the Holy Grail...is a marvelously particular kind of lunatic endeavor.","90","71853"
"18977","This ambitious, yet astonishingly well-executed Netflix tentpole directly benefits from the way Ayer’s gritty, streetwise sensibility grounds Landis’ gift for creating an elaborate comic-book mythology.","90","5519340"
"18978","Logan's Run is a rewarding futuristic film that appeals both as spectacular-looking escapist adventure as well as intelligent drama.","90","74812"
"18979","It twists it, shakes it and stands it on its ear. But as before, the film's technical brilliance is the least of its appeals. Satirically acute, intricately structured and deftly paced, it is at heart stout, good and untainted by easy sentiment.","90","96874"
"18980","This terrifyingly beautiful movie blends metaphor and stark social commentary to achieve a spontaneous grace.","90","120603"
"18981","Bristling with dangers both corporeal and cerebral, The Debt is a superbly crafted espionage thriller packed with Israeli-Nazi score settling.","90","1226753"
"18982","A work so smartly written, so beautifully filmed, so perfectly acted, that it does the almost impossible trick of turning sentimentality into true emotion.","90","97351"
"18983","Sure to become a classic; it taps into the fury of being a drone with a deeply knowing precision.","90","151804"
"18984","If the film is just as strange and endearing as its glowing protagonist -- and it is -- that's because the director and co-writer (with Mignola) is Guillermo del Toro, 43, who has the wildest imagination and grandest ambitions of anybody in modern movies.","90","411477"
"18985","There’s no need to worry that this version might crush the gentle charms of the 1991 picture: Even though Condon more or less faithfully follows that movie’s plot, this Beauty is its own resplendent creature.","90","2771200"
"18986","Lonergan layers and then layers some more, allows his characters to stew, not always disclose themselves and then come to decisions and changes naturally, or after due deliberation. And they can relapse and not always be ready for the breakthrough moment toward which the story seems to be pointing. The result is something that feels more akin to a full meal than the usual cinematic popcorn.","90","4034228"
"18987","The film consistently works as both a straightforward psychosexual thriller and something more troubling — almost unspoken — underneath.","90","5592248"
"18988","The Truman Show is one of the films for which the '90s will be remembered, and it is not to be missed.","90","120382"
"18989","I found myself reluctantly taken by the movie, and the way Scorsese uses it to maybe, just a little bit, atone for some of his own past blitheness about violence. In The Irishman, a merry darkness slowly becomes an elegy, ringed with guilt. And what could be more Irish than that?","90","1302006"
"18990","Poignant, wise and unafraid -- just the sort of film for a young person, or any person, for that matter, to make.","90","491747"
"18991","In First Reformed, Paul Schrader courts respectability and leaves it in the dust, getting stoned on excess. But make no mistake: He’s still one hell of a filmmaker.","90","6053438"

"18993","An actor of great integrity, Scheider at last makes the powerful impression we've been waiting for; he plays Joe with wonderfully delicate and telling detail. You see all the lusts and weaknesses, but you see also an underlying sweetness, a kind of forlorn and desperate innocence that makes something deeply human out of good, bad, weakness, strength, triumph, defeat and all that jazz. [24 Dec 1979, p.78]","90","78754"
"18994","It’s all a neat trick. Or exercise. Or brain-teaser. Whatever you want to call it, Upstream Color is like nothing you’ve ever seen before. But once you have seen it, once isn’t going to be enough","90","2084989"
"18995","Joel and Ethan Coen’s Inside Llewyn Davis is an exquisitely crafted tale of woe with heartfelt early-sixties folk music — and an overarching snottiness.","90","2042568"
"18996","This is a first-rate squealer. [07 Aug 1986]","90","91064"
"18997","Tim isn't super anything (though he proves heroic), and what makes Cedar Rapids a low-wattage pleasure is its insistence that his ordinariness - with his decency and sense of wonder - is pretty extraordinary.","90","1477837"
"18998","Of all the great vocal characterizations...the showstopper is Brooks, who hasn't had a part this good since ""Lost in America"" (1985). His Marlin is tender, cranky, hysterical, yet somehow lucid.","90","266543"
"18999","Ford is a true moviemaker — a social observer who’s a junkie for sensation and narrative. He has structured Nocturnal Animals beautifully, so that the past feeds into the present, and fiction into reality.","90","4550098"
"19000","This animated retelling of the familiar Old Testament story is playful, high-spirited and unmistakably amusing. It's nice to see that a sense of humor and a sense of values don't inevitably have to cancel each other out.","90","298388"
"19001","Utterly delightful. [26 June 1981, p.D1]","90","82474"
"19002","A sober and yet profoundly stirring contemplation of family, roots, identity and home, which engrosses throughout the course of its two-hour running time.","90","3741834"
"19003","Airplane! is a splendidly tacky, totally tasteless, completely insignificant flight, a gooney bird of a movie that looks as if it could never get off the ground and then surprises and delights with its free-spirited aerobatics.","90","80339"
"19004","Director Barry Levinson and screenwriter Paul Attanasio are great guys to waste time with. The latter has a real flair for writing strong, confrontational scenes -- brisk, needling, well shaped -- and the former stages them with coolly concentrated intensity. And the cast is terrific. [19 Dec 1994, p.75]","90","109635"
"19005","The film is fun and stirring; a robust portrait of youth at the crossroads and a bittersweet salute to the town at its centre.","90","78902"
"19006","Dunne is committed, thank good-ness, unapologetic for even the most fluttery sentiment or spookiest chill, enjoying the swellness of the very idea almost as much as any fanciful girl.","90","120791"
"19007","The Graduate is a delightful, satirical comedy-drama about a young man's seduction by an older woman, and the measure of maturity which he attains from the experience.","90","61722"
"19008","Kent and editor Simon Njoo show maturity and trust in their material, expertly building tension through the insidious modulation from naturalistic dysfunctional family drama to all-out boogeyman terror.","90","2321549"
"19009","Much of Her Smell, especially these backstage scenes, border on unintelligible, with numerous exchanges getting lost in the chaos. I found this to be incredibly, teeth-grindingly effective — this is a thoroughly subjective depiction of mental illness and substance abuse, and the accurate relay of information often takes a backseat in the throes of such a state.","90","7942742"
"19010","There's visceral horror, too, including a grisly image -- a horror-in-miniature involving a fingernail -- that located an open nerve in my jaded ability to endure screen violence.","90","164181"
"19011","In theory, we go to movies for enjoyment. Director Rodrigo Cortés inverts that notion with Buried, a terrific, claustrophobic, fist-clenching film in which he tortures his audience in exquisite fashion.","90","1462758"
"19012","Deftly balancing restrained sentimentalism with tough-minded human tragedy, this impressive, unashamedly classical feature debut by TV helmer James Kent has the populist heft one expects from producer David Heyman, while preserving the solemn intimacy of Brittain’s account of lives and loves severed by the conflict.","90","1441953"
"19013","People don’t forget a performer like Redford, whose movie-star charisma idles low and sexy like a Harley Davidson motor even when he’s not doing anything, and that means a movie like David Lowery’s The Old Man & the Gun — a dapper, low-key riff on the bank-robber genre — can play things soft, counting on Redford’s charm to fuel the show.","90","2837574"
"19014","Never one to shy away from unlikely sources of comedy, David O. Russell tackles mental illness, marital failure and the curative powers of football with bracingly sharp and satisfying results in Silver Linings Playbook.","90","1045658"
"19015","If an animated movie is going to offer children a way to process death, it’s hard to envision a more spirited, touching and breezily entertaining example than Coco.","90","2380307"
"19016","Stalag 17 is a black comedy before the term black comedy was coined.","90","46359"
"19017","An expertly designed theme park ride of a movie that packs nonstop thrills.","90","120685"
"19018","The brilliance is all in the execution, which is just about perfect, from the score of hard-rocking music (and ear-piercing feedback) to the gritty cinematography by Sean Porter.","90","4062536"
"19019","It's Douglas' movie - and you've got a fine movie.","90","1294213"
"19020","The talented Mr. Minghella is aping Alfred Hitchcock as effectively as Tom Ripley is doing Dickie Greenleaf.","90","134119"
"19021","Everyone in the cast is terrific, including Dermot Mulroney as Wolf, the beret-sporting cameraman who thinks he's a genius but can't seem to stop screwing up shots, and Wanda (Danielle Von Zerneck), a tough-talking assistant director who gets weak in the knees whenever Chad gets close. Best of all is Buscemi, a wonderfully offbeat, edgy performer who has appeared in such independent films as Mystery Train and Reservoir Dogs. He carries the emotional weight of the movie as his dream project faces impending doom, his red-rimmed, frog-like eyes threatening to burst with exasperation.","90","113677"
"19022","The creepiest, clammiest, twitchiest squealfest in months. It offers, among its many pleasures, the happiness of safe fear.","90","298130"
"19023","Sentimentality and violence have gone hand-in-hand from the beginning of the movies, but seldom have they been carried to such extremes and played against each other with such effectiveness as in writer-director John Woo’s The Killer (Nuart), an example of the highly addictive, supercharged, go-for-broke Hong Kong cinema at its most deliberately outrageous.","90","97202"
"19024","What Ron Howard gets, to a degree that's astonishing in a two-hour film, is the density and complexity, as well as the generous entertainment quotient, of Peter Morgan's screenplay.","90","870111"
"19025","The story in itself is first-rate. However, it’s the very measured handling that makes it distinctive.","90","1770734"
"19026","This is a Marvel movie that knows when to embrace the ridiculous and when to puncture any pomposity, and it's a delight from start to big finish. And yes, you do need to stay to the very very end of the credits.","90","3501632"
"19027","As he did in ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"", Wright immerses his heroes in pop culture's detritus and diversions, but doesn't drown them in it. You don't have to be dazzled or tickled by the movie, or get every joke, to be touched by it, too.","90","446029"
"19028","However familiar, it delivers like a shorted slot machine.","90","63462"
"19029","A Trojan horse of a teen comedy that balanced lowbrow gags with subtle humor, genuine insight—Crowe spent a year undercover as a high-school student—and pathos.","90","83929"
"19030","Nothing quite prepares you for the rough-cut diamond that is Precious. A rare blend of pure entertainment and dark social commentary, this shockingly raw, surprisingly irreverent and absolutely unforgettable story.","90","929632"
"19031","Sensitive and highly visual, this Albert Magnoli-directed film is an accomplished and sophisticated example of storytelling. Even those who aren’t Prince fans are likely to be captivated by its energy, enamored with its simple, often poignant storyline.","90","87957"
"19032","Rebel Wilson is the peroxided Aussi who stole scenes as Kristen Wiig's roommate in ""Bridesmaids,"" and this is the role that will turn her into a star.","90","1981677"
"19033","Their characters' desire (Scott Thomas and Zylberstein) -- no, need -- to repair their fragile bond feels as achingly real as the mother lode of hidden pain that gets exposed by the work of these two great actresses.","90","1068649"
"19034","Looper may not have the bell-ringing resonance of Chris Marker's ""La Jetée,"" one of its touchstones, but it's a jaunty match-up of genre and character drama that's far smarter and more finely wrought than almost anything else in the multiplexes.","90","1276104"
"19035","Finds the right balance between reverence and wit.","90","82971"
"19036","It’s an audacious concept, and Docter’s imagination, along with those of his numerous collaborators, is adventurous and genially daft enough to put it over.","90","2096673"
"19037","Wolfgang Petersen's The NeverEnding Story is a marvelously realized flight of pure fantasy.","90","88323"
"19038","The payoff comes at the end, when the myriad threads pull together with a shock like a noose tightening around your neck. Built with old-fashioned craftsmanship, Lone Star is not a movie you'll quickly forget. [8 July 1996, p.64]","90","116905"
"19039","A quantum leap in ambition from ""Hard Eight"" and ""Boogie Nights"" and is, to my mind, much more interesting.","90","175880"
"19040","Dark, sleek, funny and creepily infectious, the genetic-engineering horror-comedy Splice is a dynamic comeback vehicle for Canadian genre director Vincenzo Natali, who made a splash a few years ago with ""Cube.""","90","1017460"
"19041","It's an extraordinary film.","90","305206"
"19042","What is startling is how well While You Were Sleeping recaptures the true spirit of the best kind of modern fairy tale -- classic romantic comedy.","90","114924"
"19043","A duet between Daniel and Miyagi, a boy without a father and a father without a son. The duet is the soul of the film, but it also has heart. The paths to enlightenment are many; The Karate Kid is surely one of these. [22 June 1984, p.23]","90","87538"
"19044","A marvelous debut film for its director, writer and lead actors, Bottle Rocket is propelled by a fresh approach to the caper genre, with a trio of youthful Texan misfits thoroughly botching their half-baked ""adventures,"" with the goal of someday graduating to more ambitious levels of criminality.","90","115734"
"19045","With its strong premise, a couple of fine performances and highly polished tooling, The Jackal scores as an involving high-tech thriller that occasionally hits peaks of pulsating excitement.","90","119395"
"19046","Any way you judge it, Thing reaffirms Lee's position as a filmmaker with audacity, courage and ideas.","90","97216"
"19047","With the help of brilliant French actor Mathieu Amalric, Spielberg's longtime cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, and screenwriter Ronald Harwood (The Pianist), Schnabel has made a marvelous film that uses images with as much grace and flair as Bauby used words.","90","401383"
"19048","While the film itself isn't perfect, who cares about perfection in the face of abundant life, authentic screwiness and lovely surprises by the busload?","90","449059"
"19049","With this genuinely big entertainment, powered by a beating heart, Steven Spielberg has put the summer back in summer movies.","90","407304"
"19050","A superior nail-biter.","90","454848"
"19051","A cuttingly smart comedy.","90","94336"
"19052","One thoroughbred of a movie. Sleek, well-muscled and brisk, director Steven Soderbergh's newest offering delivers just about everything anyone could possibly want from filmed entertainment -- except deep thought.","90","240772"
"19053","Ingenious, exhilarating, funny and profound.","90","338013"
"19054","A spry teenage comedy that gets everything right, Stick It takes the usual batch of underdogs, dirt bags, mean girls and bimbos and sends them somersaulting through happy clichés and unexpected invention.","90","430634"
"19055","Mudbound requires a taste for leisurely storytelling generally more focused on building careful nuances and layered characters than on big dramatic cymbal clashes. But patient investment pays off in an epic that creeps up on you, its stealth approach laced with intelligence, elegance and an affecting balance of humanity and moral indignation.","90","2396589"
"19056","At the same time, the movie (directed by Fred Zinnemann) is too tidy.","90","45793"
"19057","Network can be faulted both for going too far and not far enough, but it's also something that very few commercial films are these days. It's alive. This, I suspect, is the Lumet drive. It's also the wit of performers like Mr. Finch, Mr. Holden, and Miss Dunaway.","90","74958"
"19058","Couldn't be more unlikely, more unfashionable -- or more compelling.","90","433383"
"19059","The holiday season just got a whole lot brighter.","90","1204342"
"19060","Barkin and DiCaprio are sensational. Every time De Niro threatens to take over the picture, they snatch our attention right back, and always with something casual: a look or a gesture that conveys how thoroughly this mother and son understand each other.","90","108330"
"19061","The director’s new masterpiece is a summation of nearly everything he has learned as a filmmaker, and about black culture, but he doesn’t feel the need to beat the audience over the head for each lesson he’s trying to impart.","90","215545"
"19062","This is no splatter movie: spare, suspenseful and brilliantly invested in silence, Bryan Bertino's debut feature unfolds in a slow crescendo of intimidation.","90","482606"
"19063","With exquisite poise, wry humor and delicate swells of feeling, The Farewell addresses and gently critiques the stoicism that Asians and Asian Americans are often taught to project as a matter of pride and dignity.","90","8637428"
"19064","Hits every color note just right. It's a visual antidepressant.","90","243585"
"19065","Casino Royale is quite possibly the best action movie of the year.","90","381061"
"19066","[Labaki] finds a magically resonant space between documentary-like vibe and dramatic performance that honors the characters’ inherent humanity while memorably framing the wretched circumstances that dictate their actions.","90","8267604"
"19067","Intelligent, involving and serious, it is as honestly emotional as Hollywood allows itself to get, a story of the search for wartime truth whose own concern for the genuine makes all the difference.","90","115956"
"19068","Bruce Beresford's sensitive direction complements Alfred Uhry's skillful adapation of his Pulitzer Prize-winning play.","90","97239"
"19069","You have to pay close attention to follow the double-crossing intricacies of the plot, but the reward for your work is dark and dirty fun.","90","119488"
"19070","Hallström has leavened the story's bleakness with great warmth, fashioning one of the finest films of the year.","90","120824"
"19071","Frank Capra and James Stewart, in returning to films after long years in uniform, endow the pic with its most telling contributions. Herewith, Stewart touches the thespic peak of his career. He hasn’t lost a whit of his erstwhile boyish personality (when called to turn it on) and further shows a maturity and depth he seems recently to have acquired.","90","38650"
"19072","Why, then, am I so pleased with Easy A? Because the movie, despite a few flaws, seems to have been made by higher intelligence, and because it catapults Emma Stone into a higher place reserved for American actors who can handle elevated language with casually dazzling aplomb.","90","1282140"
"19073","There are films as lovely, but none lovelier.","90","95765"
"19074","Undeniably, it's a strange and savage blend, and Altman has undressed the fashion world as a heap of dirty laundry. He has fashioned a super satirical sendup. [9 Dec 1994]","90","110907"
"19075","Energetic, inventive, swaggering fun, Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds is a consummate Hollywood entertainment--rich in fantasy and blithely amoral.","90","361748"
"19076","American Graffiti is more a collection of vignettes than a straight forward movie, and the quality of the different plots is a bit hit and miss. But American Graffiti's appeal has less to do with plot and more to do with seeing the USA of the early 1960s faithfully recreated in celluloid, and Lucas gets every detail right. From the diner waitresses on skates to the hokey-sounding slang to the sock hop line dances to the gorgeous soundtrack (which is a aural treasure trove of late 50s and early 60s pop), Lucas doesn't put a foot wrong.","90","69704"
"19077","Polanski, who was a Jewish child in Krakow when the Germans arrived in September 1939, presents Szpilman's story with bleak, acid humor and with a ruthless objectivity that encompasses both cynicism and compassion.","90","253474"
"19078","A thrilling, action-packed, wide-vista yarn from the sharp quills of Jack Thorne and co-writer and director Tom Harper, this Amazon-backed project is deceptively simple yet surprisingly deft.","90","6141246"
"19079","The Lost City of Z is a rare piece of contemporary classical cinema; its virtues of methodical storytelling, traditional style and obsessive theme are ones that would have been recognized and embraced anytime from the 1930s through the 1970s.","90","1212428"
"19080","This bloody celebration finally gives the American Revolution the epic it deserves.","90","187393"
"19081","So thoughtful and provocative that we cannot help but become engrossed.","90","361127"
"19082","There is no denying that Amélie is, to paraphrase its title, fabulous.","90","211915"
"19083","Director Van Sant, who made the lyrical ""Mala Noche,"" ""Drugstore Cowboy"" and ""My Own Private Idaho,"" returns to his favorite hunting ground -- the subworlds of grimy, poetic lost boys -- and pulls us right in","90","119217"
"19084","Comedian and actor Kumail Nanjiani and writer Emily V. Gordon mine their personal history for laughs, heartache, and hard-earned insight in The Big Sick, a film that’s by turns romantic, rueful, and hilarious.","90","5462602"
"19085","A captivating entertainment for the holiday season and well beyond.","90","432283"
"19086","If “Compton” is undeniably of the moment, it’s also timeless in its depiction of how artists and writers transform the world around them into angry, profane, vibrant and singular personal expression.","90","1398426"
"19087","The most successful version yet of this familiar premise.","90","128853"
"19088","In my judgment, Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile is an honestly unsettling and authentic inquiry into the question of who Ted Bundy was, how he operated, what his capture and trial and ongoing infamy has meant, and what, if anything, his existence tells us about our individual relationship to toxic evil.","90","2481498"
"19089","A sharply written, fast-talking, almost dementedly articulate satire on modern statecraft.","90","1226774"
"19090","Joyous redemptive romantic comedy.","90","116695"
"19091","While no entry in the franchise has surpassed the original film, this Halloween sequel is truly a cut above the rest and a great piece of horror entertainment even for those unfamiliar with the series.","90","1502407"
"19092","A true movie rarity: a brutally honest romance. If you loved ""Sleepless in Seattle,"" you'll just hate it.","90","118842"
"19093","Though the politically incorrect language is tough enough to have earned Clerks an initial NC-17 rating (re-rated R on appeal), its exuberance gives it an alive and kicking feeling that is welcome and rare. [19 Oct 1994]","90","109445"
"19094","A refreshing throwback to another era of moviemaking: This movie was poured from the bottle, not one of those bar regulator machines. It's got the kick, style and flavor of a straight-up story, before movies were watered down with the opinions of marketers, lawyers and committee heads.","90","318374"
"19095","If Frears and screenwriter Donald E. Westlake (who scripted ""The Stepfather"") are light on substance, they're satisfyingly heavy on nuance. Grifters may not blow you away afterward but it keeps your attention riveted during.","90","99703"
"19096","Scorsese didn't need to remake ""Infernal Affairs,"" but what he has done with it is a compliment rather than an affront to the original: The Departed reimagines its source material rather than just leeching off it, preserving the bone structure of the first movie while finding new curves in it. The story has been clarified; the ellipses of the original have been filled in with just the right amount of exploratory shading. This is a picture of grand gestures and subtle intricacies, a movie that, even at more than two hours long, feels miraculously lean. It's a smart shot of lucid storytelling.","90","407887"
"19097","Ali is a bruiser, unwieldy in length and ambition. But Mann and Smith deliver this powerhouse with the urgency of a champ's left hook.","90","248667"
"19098","The movie puts us in Maria's shoes, taking us step by suspenseful step through her physical and spiritual ordeal.","90","390221"

"19101","It's an unapologetic dazzler, which is why it's never overwhelmed by its themes.","90","180073"
"19102","In general an excellent Hal Ashby film which illuminates the conflicting attitudes on the Vietnam debacle from the standpoint of three participants.","90","77362"
"19103","Fierce and disturbing, with a plot that skillfully resists following any familiar course. The film's hero fears that he's half-crazy, and for two hours Mr. Gilliam artfully keeps his audience feeling the same way.","90","114746"
"19104","Sicario is an ambush, a low-slung film about a dirty drugs war with Mexico which challenges and engages in equal measure. It moves with grim tenacity, confounding expectations until its very final sequence.","90","3397884"
"19105","First-time helmer Peter Sohn and screenwriter Meg LeFauve (“Inside Out”) have created a fantastic and frequently exhilarating feature that showcases Pixar’s greatest strengths: technical brilliance, emotional texture, crossover appeal, and an impish sense of humor that takes the utmost advantage of the animated form.","90","1979388"
"19106","Fruitvale is outstanding, a telling portrait and testament to the life of one man and the complicated relationships to race and class that still exist within America today.","90","2334649"
"19107","It's a welcome throwback to the days when the world didn't have to end or tanker trucks explode to get an action audience's attention.","90","122690"
"19108","A stylish and muscular thriller with some nifty twists and turns, a wicked sense of humor, several terrific performances and not one or even two but three of the best car chases in recent action-flick history.","90","1401152"
"19109","Muscularly directed by Gavin O’Connor, whose facility with emotional dramas with sports connections goes as far back as 2004’s Miracle, The Way Back is elevated and transformed by one of Ben Affleck’s strongest and most convincing performances.","90","8544498"
"19110","This confident, crisply made piece of work does an expert job of bringing us inside the inner sanctum of a top Wall Street investment bank in extremis, giving us a convincing and coolly dramatic portrait of what it must have been like when titans trembled.","90","1615147"
"19111","Blood Simple becomes a dazzling comedie noire, a dynamic, virtuoso display by a couple of talented fledgling filmmakers who give the conventions of the genre such a thorough workout that the result is a movie that's fresh and exhilarating (in the way that Jean-Jacques Beineix’s “Diva” was).","90","86979"
"19112","It's charming. It's hilarious. It is perhaps the most beautifully crafted, lovingly rendered portrait of extreme geekitude ever to grace the screen. It's Napoleon Dynamite.","90","374900"
"19113","Farhadi isn’t interested in judging his characters so much as comprehending them in all their complexity, and registering the consequences of their actions, particularly on children.","90","2404461"
"19114","A haunting, nightmarish vision.","90","68473"
"19115","Harboring few ambitions beyond knock-your-socks-off action sequences, this crafty revenge thriller delivers with so much style — and even some wit — that the lack of substance takes longer than it should to become problematic.","90","2911666"
"19116","Cage again proves himself the most fearless actor now working in movies.","90","113627"
"19117","In the end, what Minghella has wrought is a nearly perfect drama of love and war (still the great subjects, after all), an epic that's fluent, frightening and beautiful all at once, that lifts the heart and dashes our dreams in about equal measure.","90","159365"
"19118","Ranks with the best of the bunch, given its spooky storyline that fuses religion with down-to-earth characters.","90","145531"
"19119","Fresh, virulently funny, with an eye on life that's as offbeat as the early Beatles movies, the talents behind the bizarre and irreverent Repo Man are a real discovery. [16 Nov 1986, p.5]","90","87995"
"19120","Ballad doesn’t reinvent the Coens’ sardonic, measured aesthetic, but the anthology’s looser structure allows them a friskiness that is welcome from such masterful veterans.","90","6412452"
"19121","Although skirting the inexplicable and the absurd, Assassination Nation is a pulpy and immensely entertaining roller coaster, hallmarked by its relentless sociocritical bite and refined cinematic craft.","90","6205872"
"19122","Writer-directors Pete Docter and Bob Peterson present hilarious insights into bird brains and canine psychology and treat thornier human emotions deftly.","90","1049413"
"19123","Whatever may be flawed in Oliver Stone's searing, full-torque new war movie ""Salvador"", one thing about it is burningly right: It's alive. It broils, snaps and explodes with energy. The events (condensed from two years of battles and political upheaval in El Salvador) fly past at a murderous clip, hurtling you along almost demonically. [10 Apr 1986, p.6]","90","91886"
"19124","Though screenwriter David Mamet writes some chewy lines, director Sidney Lumet balances out any pulpiness with a somber mood, making sparing use of the musical score and creating a Boston awash in brown, beige, and gray.","90","84855"
"19125","Halloween: H20 is as stylish and scary as it is ultra-violent. It's a work of superior craftsmanship in all aspects.","90","120694"
"19126","In his best film since ""Unforgiven,"" Eastwood ultimately lets observations on character, community, and the tidal patterns of tragedy shoulder a burden an ordinary murder mystery never could.","90","327056"
"19127","Coppola handles her film with very pleasant economy, with a kind of warm precision. Her father, who was one of this picture's producers, can be as proud of her as we are grateful.","90","335266"
"19128","With Boyhood, Linklater has created an uncanny time capsule, inviting auds to relive their own upbringing through a series of artificial memories pressed like flowers between the pages of a family photo album.","90","1065073"

"19131","A dazzling delight.","90","120587"
"19132","In Okja, Joon Ho takes animal cruelty and corporate capitalism to slaughter. And yet, he doesn’t preach or pander.","90","3967856"
"19133","Brilliantly reimagines the glam-rock 70's as a brave new world of electrifying theatricality and sexual possibility, to the point where identifying precise figures in this neo-psychedelic landscape is almost beside the point.","90","120879"
"19134","One of the funniest movies of the year, but you may need to shower afterwards.","90","129387"
"19135","It’s a rich, glorious mess, and its underlying craftsmanship is apparent in the characters’ beautifully delineated relationships, each with its own jangly rhythm and distinct feel.","90","1800241"
"19136","The director, Howard Hawks, keeps all this trifling nonsense in such artful balance that it never impinges on the real world; it may be the American movies' closest equivalent to Restoration comedy.","90","29947"
"19137","Conventional but rousingly effective picture.","90","1028576"
"19138","A great movie, easily the most brilliant of the “Nightmare on Elm Street” series. It’s witty, smart, funny, entertaining, and you’ll still like yourself in the morning for watching it.","90","111686"
"19139","Anchored by an internalized performance from Amy Adams rich in emotional depth, this is a grownup sci-fi drama that sustains fear and tension while striking affecting chords on love and loss.","90","2543164"
"19140","What distinguishes Borten and Wallack’s screenplay is its refusal to sentimentalize by providing humbling epiphanies to set Ron on the right path and endow him with empathy.","90","790636"
"19141","As much as this latest installment draws on affection for the snappy first film, it's the differences that make Bridget Jones's Baby the warmest and most satisfying of the series.","90","1473832"
"19142","Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country is one of the finest installments in the saga. [6 Dec. 1991, p.5]","90","102975"
"19143","Please Give is an almost perfectly rendered slice of life, buoyant with wonderful performances.","90","878835"
"19144","Affliction is a harsh experience, but the harshness isn't a matter of punishing the audience or of the director, Schrader, showing off his toughness: That unvarnished harshness is the very essence of the material.","90","118564"
"19145","Helen Mirren's flinty performance as Elizabeth II is getting all the attention, but equally impressive is Peter Morgan's insightful script for this UK drama, which quietly teases out the social, political, and historical implications of the 1997 death of Diana, Princess of Wales.","90","436697"
"19146","Mr. Redford has found his own visually eloquent way to turn the potboiler into a panorama, with a deep-seated love for the Montana landscape against which his rapturously beautiful film unfolds.","90","119314"
"19147","In his finest, funniest, most poignant film to date, Tim Burton plays cinematic alchemist, turning drive-in schlock into movie gold.","90","109707"
"19148","Blanchett gives this dynamo of intelligence and doggedness a real human dimension that allows the propulsive drama to breathe; it’s another stellar performance that rates among her best.","90","3859076"
"19149","Extraordinarily simple, yet deeply, emotionally rich.","90","69303"
"19150","Although Josh Olson's script was originally based on a graphic novel by John Wagner and Vince Locke, it has now unmistakably become a Cronenberg movie, and one of his finest.","90","399146"
"19151","The Boxtrolls is a kiddie charmer that makes you laugh, cower, and think of Hitler. That’s an unusual trifecta, but then again, this is an unusual film.","90","787474"
"19152","A very entertaining get-tough fantasy with political and feminist underpinnings.","90","119173"
"19153","Perkins gives a remarkably effective in-a-dream kind of performance as the possessed young man. Others play it straight, with equal competence.","90","54215"
"19154","As unusual and idiosyncratic as its one-of-a-kind title. You'd expect no less from Terry Gilliam, and admirers of this singular filmmaker will be pleased to know that ""Imaginarium"" is one of his most original and accessible works.","90","1054606"
"19155","Unlike ""Heathers,"" a satiric treatment of teen suicide, Pump Up the Volume is passionately caring. It's a howl from the heart, a relentlessly involving movie that gives a kid every reason to believe that he or she can come of age. It appreciates the pimples and pitfalls of this frightening passage, the transit commonly known as adolescence.","90","100436"
"19156","A stunning achievement in epic cinema.","90","89881"
"19157","Working closely with master editor William Goldenberg, Greengrass has given 22 July a relentless, remorseless quality, insisting on a matter-of-fact style that allows no escape from reality even while refusing to push anything too hard.","90","7280898"
"19158","To appreciate the movie, you have to be okay with vampire violence. I don't mean subtle little nips at the neck and, ooooh, it's directed by Werner Herzog.","90","187738"
"19159","Mr. Fonda gives one of the great performances of his long, truly distinguished career. Here is film acting of the highest order, the kind that is not discovered overnight in the laboratory, but seems to be the distillation of hundreds of performances.","90","82846"
"19160","It’s a haunting and masterful effort, but be warned: This is tough stuff.","90","4080956"
"19161","Propelled by lovely, engaging writing and wonderful performances, Stan & Ollie, the story of the bittersweet final bow of legendary duo Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, should move and delight fans of the beloved performers while enjoyably exposing the less initiated to these comedy giants.","90","3385524"
"19162","The director, Michael Gracey, is an Australian maker of commercials who has never directed a feature before, and he works with an exuberant sincerity that can’t be faked. The Greatest Showman is a concoction, the kind of film where the pieces all click into place, yet at an hour and 45 minutes it flies by, and the link it draws between P.T. Barnum and the spirit of today is more than hype.","90","1485796"
"19163","Identity is an outright blast, so fun it's--pardon--scary.","90","309698"
"19164","A movie heart-breaker of oddball wit and startling grace.","90","109830"
"19165","Shrewdly reconceived, powerfully acted and hugely entertaining.","90","368008"
"19166","The new A Star Is Born has the rare distinction of being a superlative remake. Barbra Streisand's performance as the rising star is her finest screen work to date, while Kris Kristofferson's magnificent portrayal of her failing benefactor realizes all the promise first shown five years earlier in Cisko Pike.","90","75265"
"19167","Darius Khondji's cinematography evokes to the hilt the gorgeously inviting Paris of so many people's imaginations (while conveniently ignoring the rest), and the film has the concision and snappy pace of Allen's best work.","90","1605783"
"19168","It's a movie that walks on air.","90","98635"
"19169","This absorbing drama provides Denzel Washington with one of his meatiest, most complex roles, and he flies with it.","90","1907668"
"19170","This being a Tarantino film, the conversations are as long and lurid and finely choreographed as the martial-arts set pieces.","90","378194"
"19171","An Officer and a Gentleman deserves a 21-gun salute, maybe 42. Rarely does a film come along with so many finely-drawn characters to care about.","90","84434"
"19172","What I can say for sure is You Only Live Twice is the Bond film I have seen most often and I have enjoyed the hell out it every single time.","90","62512"
"19173","Sling Blade is perhaps the year's most impressive debut because it is an uncompromisingly told tale with a minimum of frills.","90","117666"
"19174","The films have only gotten better by letting the relationship marinate. ""Midnight's"" more disgruntled edge reflects what creeps up on couples as years pass, regrets stack up, kids factor in, real life intervenes.","90","2209418"
"19175","With a brisk pace and satiric blend of nostalgia and violence, it's the sharpest, funniest comedy so far this year.","90","119229"
"19176","Don't dig too deep into The Other Side of the Wind: It's largely surface. But what a surface. And what a chest of toys for a man who never lost his childlike delight in playing with the medium.","90","69049"
"19177","If nothing else, Mistress America confirms Gerwig as one of the great, fearless screen comediennes of her generation — a tall, loose-limbed whirligig who careers through scenes with the beatific ditziness of a Carole Lombard or Judy Holliday.","90","2872462"
"19178","Being There's dry, dark humor sneaks up on you: until Chauncey arrives at Douglas's home you may not even know it is a comedy. That's Ashby's method, and his confidence pays off in one of the year's most unusual and engrossing films. [31 Dec 1979, p.48]","90","78841"
"19179","Ford makes such a dynamic president in Air Force One, you may find yourself favorably weighing his odds in Iowa and New Hampshire.","90","118571"
"19180","Sophomoric silliness.","90","113749"
"19181","Its great distinction lies in re-creating an age when thoughts and feelings were to be carefully considered and precisely enunciated. The best costumers, set designers, and property masters can’t conjure up the mental and emotional spaces of a simpler era; that requires a filmmaker who knows the virtue of quiet, patience, and attentiveness.","90","810784"
"19182","Baby Driver, Wright’s first-ever solo screenplay, is a thrilling and original cinematic joyride that pays homage to heist masterpieces while creating a legacy of its own.","90","3890160"
"19183","What makes Super Dark Times one of the most exciting American filmmaking debuts in recent years is how well Phillips and company grasp both the intensity and ephemerality of adolescence.","90","5112578"
"19184","With the best use of motion capture yet, Spielberg has translated the story of the youthful Tintin, his spirited pooch Snowy and the eccentric Captain Haddock into a first class action adventure that serves as the perfect cross between ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" and Spielberg's own ""Indiana Jones"" series.","90","983193"
"19185","Moving and frighteningly real.","90","829459"
"19186","The filmmakers clearly value their public, crafting a splendid period swooner that delivers classic romance and an indelible insider's view of 1930s circus life.","90","1067583"
"19187","Transformers is a wet dream for fanboys, with vehicles that whiz and whir into alien robots, spectacular sci-fi stunt chases, glistening military hardware, overheated computer software and brainy, hot girls who love Popular Mechanics.","90","418279"
"19188","Nothing short of an invasion could add much to Casablanca.","90","34583"
"19189","It must weather some bummy mid-passage exposition, but the movie survives its flaws triumphantly, evolving into a uniquely transporting filmgoing spectacle.","90","75860"
"19190","The filmmakers succeed brilliantly in weaving these stories together, taking time to explore depth of character and relationships. The suspense builds throughout as everyone involved becomes lost in a place they don't understand with people they don't know if they can trust.","90","449467"
"19191","Begins like an episode of ""I Love Lucy"" and ends with the impact of ""Easy Rider.""","90","103074"
"19192","Us is a bit predictable and contains a few jumbled auditory edits. However, these small missteps are in the service of an ambitious story that has a lot to say about what divides us as humans and how those divisions hurt everyone. Peele’s direction contains a tight grasp on horror and comedy, balancing both perfectly. His game cast shines brightly in their dual roles, and the ending makes the whole endeavor well worth your time.","90","6857112"
"19193","Not only gives us a superb new cast of believable characters, it transcends its own genre. Only superficially a teen comedy, the movie redounds with postmodern -- but emotionally genuine -- gravitas.","90","467406"
"19194","It's a deluxe vacation for adults with all frills included: glamorous settings, glamorous clothes, glamorous sex.","90","155267"
"19195","Director Miller keeps the pic moving with cyclonic force, photography by Dean Semler is first class, editing is supertight, and Brian May’s music is stirring.","90","82694"
"19196","Notre Dame professor Edward Fischer has said that the best films, like the best books, tell how it is to be human under certain circumstances. Larry McMurtry did a beautiful job of this in his small novel (which he transferred to the screen), The Last Picture Show.","90","67328"
"19197","This is a superior horror film. It hits hard and fast, letting up only to inject some black humor and amp up the tension again before coming back for more. Feast is nasty, brutish, and short, just like Hobbes said all horror flicks should be.","90","426459"
"19198","Writer-director Richard Ayoade has the knack. A fresh and inventive cinematic voice, he's taken a subject that's been beaten half to death and brought it miraculously to life in his smart and funny debut feature, Submarine.","90","1440292"
"19199","This sinister black comedy of murder accelerates until it becomes a grotesque fantasy of murder. The actors seem to be having a boisterous good time getting themselves knocked off.","90","48281"
"19200","There is never an instant, in fact, when Director Hitchcock is not in minute and masterly control of his material: script, camera, cutting, props, the handsome set constructed from his ideas, the stars he has Hitched to his vehicle.","90","47396"
"19201","You may find yourself resisting this sentimental pageant of early-20th-century rural English life, replete with verdant fields, muddy tweeds and damp turnips, but my strong advice is to surrender.","90","1568911"
"19202","Writer-director Mike White has crafted a painfully funny and surprisingly moving character piece, but what’s most remarkable is how he and his star empathize with Brad’s feelings of inferiority while, at the same time, pinpointing the arrogance, privilege and callousness that often factor into such soul-searching.","90","5884230"
"19203","Jenkins and cinematographer James Laxton’s palette is rich and warm, its colors deepened by a score by Nicholas Britell that ranges from a distant, forlorn trumpet to a string quartet in which the players dig in as if they’re having their own dialogue between hope and despair. The close-ups are immense, the emotions archetypal.","90","7125860"
"19204","Lucas is a major figure, and Revenge of the Sith may be some kind of historic achievement -- the first movie in which it is fully impossible to tell where flesh ends and digital paint begins.","90","121766"
"19205","Eastwood once again takes a sharp stab at America’s penchant for attacking first, asking questions later.","90","3513548"
"19206","This is a bleak but mesmerizing piece of filmmaking; it offers a glancing, chilled view of a world in which brief moments of loyalty flicker between repeated acts of betrayal.","90","1568346"
"19207","Raw but utterly enveloping.","90","1399683"
"19208","Though definitely one of the best American movies of the year--a work of high ensemble talent and intelligence, gorgeously mounted and crafted, artistically audacious in ways that most American movies don't even attempt--it's still a disappointment… It's not the capstone we might have wanted Coppola to make. [23 Dec 1990, Calendar, p.9]","90","99674"
"19209","One of the most entertaining escape movies ever made, a rousing 1963 big-scale production directed by John Sturges and written by James Clavell. [12 May 1991, p.4]","90","57115"
"19210","Favreau, who wrote ""Swingers,"" has now directed and written the hilarious Made, which re-teams him with Vaughn. The two play off each other so well that they recall fond memories of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau.","90","227005"
"19211","The Nice Guys is an ultra-violent burlesque, the sort of cheerfully hostile buddy bash that’s been a staple since the ’80s, only this one is singularly clever about its own triviality, and it offers the scruffy pleasure of seeing two great actors dial down their gravitas with style.","90","3799694"
"19212","We don't go to Michael Haneke films for comfort, but to gaze through a glass darkly. That vision -- tense, provocative and unnerving -- is on full display in The White Ribbon, which could be considered a culmination of this difficult director's brilliant career.","90","1149362"
"19213","Fast, exhilarating new comedy.","90","128445"
"19214","The smartest, funniest, and best-looking sci-fi comedy since the movies learned to morph.","90","119654"
"19215","Kat's English assignment, which provides the movie's title, is a sweet finish to an entertaining movie -- and makes 10 Things I Hate About You quite likable.","90","147800"

"19225","Exults in the hard-riding romanticism of classic Westerns, but it takes revisionist stock too. It dismounts at places usually left in the dust -- the oppressed lot of women, the loneliness of untended children, adult illiteracy and the horrible last moments of the dying.","90","105695"
"19226","After watching Gibson and Glover grow accustomed to each other, develop trust and confidence in each other and charge bullheadedly into dangerous situations, you can't help but hope there's a ""Lethal Weapon II."" It would be one of the few times a sequel would make sense and dollars.","90","93409"
"19227","In his brilliantly evocative and warmly comic Hope and Glory, John Boorman shifts the point of view downward, away from the tense and preoccupied adults, to that of a sweetly thoughtful 7-year-old boy, to whom the war is something else entirely. [30 Oct 1987, p.1]","90","93209"
"19228","Nearly every detail sources directly back to Kaui Hart Hemmings' sensitively crafted novel, and yet, Payne's triumph is in striking the right tone -- and knowing what to leave unsaid.","90","1033575"
"19229","A picture about war and politics that has manages to be both rational and inspirational. It is also the year's funniest smart movie.","90","472062"
"19230","Lehmann isn't in perfect control - the movie gets off to a flat-footed start, and the conclusion is chaotic - but when Heathers hits its stride, it reaches wild and original comic heights. [2 April 1989]","90","97493"
"19231","Ruby Sparks doesn't try to pretend to be more than it is: a sleek, beautifully written and acted romantic comedy that glides down to earth in a gently satisfying soft landing.","90","1839492"
"19232","Gorgeously animated and stirringly told, Disney's Mulan is a timeless story that will delight kids and divert adults with its sweeping scope, emotional intimacy and screwball humor.","90","120762"
"19233","Reimagined instead of recycled, an adaptation of a '60s old TV show emerges as a first-rate thriller.","90","106977"
"19234","It is Mr. Soderbergh’s insistence on seeing the A.D.M. scandal as a collective tragedy rather than as another white-collar crime that gives the movie force, resonance, feeling.","90","1130080"
"19235","Making a terrifying menace out of what is assumed to be one of nature's most innocent creatures and one of man's most melodious friends, Mr. Hitchcock and his associates have constructed a horror film that should raise the hackles on the most courageous and put goose-pimples on the toughest hide.","90","56869"
"19236","Like all of the best pop art, Tarantino's film is both seriously entertaining and seriously thoughtful, rattling the cage of race in America on-screen and off.","90","1853728"
"19237","Flawed, but often brilliant, provocative film-making.","90","114558"
"19238","Never less than engaging; all that’s missing is a proper crescendo. The picture moves along briskly, even at two and a half hours, but it seems to be running on cruise control.","90","264464"
"19239","There's no better fun for movie lovers than a small, unheralded film that turns out to be terrific -- unless it's a small, unheralded sequel that trumps the original.","90","463854"
"19240","What's so powerful about the film is the rich stories it tells and how it leads them like so many human tributaries to one black, bubbling source.","90","365737"
"19241","Leigh pushes the story in a more interesting direction, asking whether people find happiness or simply will it on themselves.","90","1045670"
"19242","Face/Off is a summer movie extraordinaire: violent, imaginative, crazily funny and, oddly moving. Hollywood has finally wised up and let Hong Kong auteur John Woo strut his stuff in all its undiluted, over-the-top glory.","90","119094"
"19243","A film of tenderness and humor married to the unlikeliest of subjects.","90","1866249"

"19247","Cianfrance and his actors, Michelle Williams and Ryan Gosling, have not made a cold or schematic film. They aim instead for raw emotional experience, one that's full of insight into the ways a relationship can go astray, but mostly feels like a slow-motion punch to the gut.","90","1120985"
"19248","A fantastically entertaining movie.","90","1540133"

"19251","Big Trouble in Little China is a far more enjoyable mash-up of classic Westerns, Saturday-morning serials, and Chinese wu xia than any of the Indiana Jones movies, with Kurt Russell in full bloom as Carpenter’s de rigueur hard-drinkin’, hard-gamblin’, wise-crackin’ loner hero—a bowling-alley John Wayne.","90","90728"
"19252","A quintessentially wised-up insider comedy, ideally cast and filled with sharp writing from start to finish.","90","120202"
"19253","What's most memorable, most striking about Superbad is the canny evocation of male friendship in all its richness and complexity.","90","829482"
"19254","All the movie's playfulness rubs off on the actors. Scenes crackle with life. The chemistry among all the actors is terrific.","90","1532503"
"19255","J. Edgar is a somber, enigmatic, darkly fascinating tale, and how could it be otherwise?","90","1616195"
"19256","Up until 1968, horror had been escapist. But Night of the Living Dead made horror serious business.","90","63350"
"19257","Does it matter that stretches of Miles Ahead — a gun-rattling, squealing-tire car chase included — came out of the filmmakers’ imagination rather than Davis’s life? (Mr. Cheadle shares script credit with Steven Baigelman.) Purists may howl, but they’ll also miss the pleasure and point of this playfully impressionistic movie.","90","790770"
"19258","An entertaining, emotional, and surprisingly intimate movie--an epic saga of fauns and talking (Cockney) beavers and evil sorceresses and triumphal resurrections and massive, sweeping battles that nonetheless feels … small.","90","363771"
"19259","With a mad doctor like Ken Russell at the helm, one happily follows this movie to hell and back. [29 Dec 1980, p.65]","90","80360"
"19260","It's an expertly constructed thrill ride with wonderful atmosphere and tremendous good humor; if its heart of gold is artificial, that won't stop you from enjoying the heck out of it.","90","1650062"
"19261","There is always an interesting tension in Cameron's work between masculine and feminine qualities. When it finally hits the fan here, we're in for the mother of all battles.","90","90605"
"19262","Observed mostly from Remy's rat's-eye view, Gusteau's kitchen is a memorable world-in-miniature with its vivid old-fashioned stoves, bright, brassy pots and general air of frenzied industry; never did sliced red onions or simmering soup look so fresh and real.","90","382932"
"19263","A piercing, immersive, and superbly played convent drama in which the suppression of speech is witnessed at both an individual and institutional level.","90","4513316"
"19264","It's a feel-good movie, but not in a bad way. It makes you feel good the way that “Forrest Gump” made you feel good, as if the filmmakers were seriously trying to make a fun, wholesome, entertaining movie without taking on the industry with a moral agenda.","90","327137"
"19265","Black Panther delivers the goods as an adventure film, a political statement, and a cultural celebration. It shakes off a sluggish start thanks to a memorable cast of characters going up against Marvel’s best-realized villain in almost a decade.","90","1825683"
"19266","In the spirit of the original, Linklater closes with one of the best endings of its kind since George Romero's ""Martin.""","90","381681"
"19267","Rebounding from his biggest career flopflop with ""Havana,"" Sydney Pollack has done an ultra-pro job in giving spit and polish to this star-driven, sure-fire commercial project.","90","106918"
"19268","A satirical comedy--ruthless and heartbreaking, but a comedy nonetheless. The movie is also about disintegration and the possibility of rebirth. In other words, it’s a small miracle.","90","367089"
"19269","Indoors, it's Jane Austen. Outdoors, this red-blooded, exuberantly romantic version of Pride and Prejudice plays more like Emily Brontë. Purists may object, but most will find this love story irresistible.","90","414387"
"19270","Though the movie's at least 20 minutes too long, it's deeply satisfying, full of old-school buddy banter and the kind of action sequences that make you burst out laughing at their sheer audacity.","90","337978"
"19271","No less impressive than the narrative mastery here, however, is the technical execution of this bold minimalist experiment.","90","2692904"
"19272","A delectable reworking of the ultimate girl's myth, a corporate Cinderella story with shades of a self-made Pygmalion.","90","96463"
"19273","It's a warm, richly funny and highly enjoyable human story that takes an intriguing sideways glance at a crucial period in 20th-century history.","90","1504320"

"19275","Serenity is a trim little picture of epic proportions.","90","379786"
"19276","A richly rewarding but often very disturbing, even harrowing work.","90","3464902"
"19277","What makes this film so powerful is that its unanswered questions force the audience to examine hate and its consequences making American History X one lesson you can't miss.","90","120586"
"19278","A movie in which 80s glamour is being defined...The three stars seem perfect at what they're doing.","90","97322"
"19279","With a nuanced script, standout performances, and the adrenaline of a well-executed heist, Hustlers is an entertaining ride with something meaningful to say about power and control.","90","5503686"
"19280","There isn't a banal moment in Winslet's performance--not a gesture, not a word. Is Winslet now the best English-speaking film actress of her generation? I think so.","90","959337"
"19281","These minor lapses, though, do not seriously affect the bewitching qualities of the film—which, in addition to being superb suspense, is a wicked argument against planned parenthood.","90","63522"
"19282","The most shocking thing about Avengers: Endgame is that there are several moments within this colossal movie that feel like a Marvel miracle. These are the pockets of time when what you watch on screen sends a shock of joy jumping through your skin, making your eyes go wide and watery at the spectacle.","90","4154796"
"19283","Trashy and opportunistic as some of it is, Training Day is the most vital police drama since ""The French Connection"" or ""Serpico.""","90","139654"
"19284","The makers of this film are clearly fans, and they've put more heart and genuine humor into this piece than Paramount has into the original franchise in years.","90","177789"
"19285","Apparently, the movie has caused annoyance in some quarters because it criticizes the American way of life. This it does, and with suavity and supreme good humor. WALL-E is a classic, but it will never appeal to people who are happy with art only when it has as little bite as possible.","90","910970"
"19286","The new picture provides a master coursed in cunning visual art and ultra-satisfying entertainment.","90","441773"
"19287","Stoppard's luxuriant, richly comic language cascades and washes over you, and, for once, more than keeps pace with the sprightly pictures.","90","138097"
"19288","Not since “Superbad” has a high school comedy so perfectly nailed how exhilarating it feels to act out at that age ... In this year’s class of first-time feature directors, Wilde handily earns the title of Most Likely to Succeed.","90","1489887"
"19289","The architecture of Pulp Fiction may look skewed and strained, but the decoration is a lot of fun. [10 Oct 1994, p.95]","90","110912"
"19290","As with his other works, [Mann] binds sound, music and pictures into one hypnotic triaxial cable and plugs it right into your brain. He makes this almost-three-hour experience practically glide by.","90","113277"
"19291","I confess I don't fully understand Danny's (or the movie's) zigs and zags, but I was glued to the thing anyway -- it has an inexplicable inner logic -- and I admire Bean for refusing to settle into any easy groove.","90","247199"
"19292","Peck's icy remove works for once—as a kid's idea of a parent, he's frighteningly effective.","90","56592"
"19293","American Animals requires many cuts and perspectives which are second-nature to an accomplished documentarian, yet the drama here also seems effortless and seamlessly integrated.","90","6212478"
"19294","A classic adventure story that brilliantly transcends its fairly average formula (buttoned-up city gal is softened by devil-may-care chancer while outwitting baddies in foreign lands) through a mixture of perfect casting, lashings of chemistry between the stars and a clever script.","90","88011"
"19295","The film abounds with pinpoint insights into its mildly rebellious heroine's hunger to shed the restraints of home and Catholic school and bust into an independent life, and does so with a wealth of keenly observed detail.","90","4925292"
"19296","Elevates a significant moment in the history of this massively passionate spectator sport.","90","1226271"
"19297","One of those stories that without a particularly strong plot manages to come through in a big way, due to the acting, dialog, situations and direction. In other words, the story has that intangible quality of charm which arises from a smooth blending of the various ingredients. Difficult to analyze, impossible to designedly reproduce. Just a happy accident.","90","25316"
"19298","If Kelly felt it necessary to add the new material, that's all to the good. It just means there's more to love.","90","246578"

"19300","It can take a TV series an entire season to establish a political intrigue as elaborate as the one Cedar devises here — and even longer to flesh out such a fascinating protagonist, when all Cedar had to do was give this archetype a name.","90","4191702"
"19301","This return to traditional Disney territory is geared to captivate children while allowing them to maintain their street cred, largely by combining extravagant animated technique with ranging musical styles.","90","97757"
"19302","Remarkably, Hacksaw Ridge coalesces into a memorable whole.","90","2119532"
"19303","Into the Woods, the splendid Disney screen adaptation of the Stephen Sondheim-James Lapine musical, infuses new vitality into the tired marketing concept of entertainment for “children of all ages.” That usually translates to mean only children and their doting parents. But with Into the Woods, you grow up with the characters, young and old, in a lifelong process of self-discovery.","90","2180411"
"19304","The second Star Trek movie is swift, droll and adventurous, not to mention appealingly gadget-happy. It's everything the first one should have been and wasn't.","90","84726"
"19305","A roller coaster of emotions that will have you laughing one moment and gasping in shock the next.","90","887883"
"19306","When the film concludes, you may find yourself wanting to watch it again to fully absorb the journey Zvyagintsev took you on. And because Loveless is so accomplished, the repeat viewing promises to be deeply rewarding.","90","6304162"
"19307","For dinosaurs to rule the earth again, the monsters needed majesty as well as menace. And Spielberg got it all right. [14 June 1993, p.69]","90","107290"
"19308","Gerwig’s script is far more comical than any previously committed to film. This she achieves by emphasizing the humor inherent in the source material.","90","3281548"
"19309","It may be the most visually imaginative Shakespeare film since Akira Kurosawa's ""Ran"", and certainly one of the more operatic Hollywood creations of recent years.","90","117509"
"19310","It's important to remember that Sinclair was as much a committed socialist as a novelist, someone who probably wrote for political purpose more than for dramatic effect. So while Day-Lewis' gorgeous acting largely disguises it, the people in ""Blood"" tend to be schematic and the film as a whole has a weakness for the didactic.","90","469494"
"19311","Delivers enough thrills, kicks and cool moments to satiate geeks, fans and mere general viewers worldwide -- until the ""Revolutions"" installment wraps up the trilogy in November.","90","234215"
"19312","In this judicious, irresistible romantic comedy, all the performers are tops. [14 Dec 1987, p.82]","90","92699"
"19313","The screws are tightened expertly in this suspenseful meller about a flipped-out femme who makes life hell for the married man who scorns her.","90","93010"
"19314","Reveals a chilling reality: how hard it is to tell a simple truth when big business doesn't want it told.","90","140352"
"19315","The spoof-policier series is about non-stop gags, pure and simple, and this third instalment, for all its lax plotting and ludicrous characterisation, remains infinitely more pleasurable than sticking you face in a fan. Indeed, the five minutes of the pre-credits sequence are quite possibly the funniest since the talkies came in. Thereafter, it's hit and miss, but the hits are so frequent and spot-on, you'd have to be dead (and buried) not to find the film painfully hilarious. Inspired, inspirational, gloriously inane.","90","110622"
"19316","The Jedi return to us at last, older, wiser and frankly irresistible. Of all its many qualities, Return of the Jedi is fully satisfying, it gives honest value to all the hopes of its believers. With this last of the central ""Star Wars"" cycle, there is the sense of the closing of a circle, of leaving behind real friends. It is accomplished with a weight and a new maturity that seem entirely fitting, yet the movie has lost none of its sense of fun; it bursts with new inventiveness. With Jedi, George Lucas may have pulled off the first triple crown of motion pictures.","90","86190"
"19317","Girls Trip more than delivers what its audience is looking for.","90","3564472"
"19318","Cloverfield never stops to identify the why, whence, or whereto of its rampaging meanie—this relentless thriller stops for nothing—but as for what to call it, behold . . . al-Qaedzilla!","90","1060277"
"19319","Farrell and Kidman are astonishingly gifted at playing the subtext of every scene.","90","5715874"
"19320","What makes it a prototype film noir is the vein of unease missing from the two earlier versions of Hammett's novel. Filmed almost entirely in interiors, it presents a claustrophobic world animated by betrayal, perversion and pain, never - even at its most irresistibly funny, as when Cook listens in outraged disbelief while his fat sugar daddy proposes to sell him down the line - quite losing sight of this central abyss of darkness, ultimately embodied by Mary Astor's sadly duplicitous siren.","90","33870"
"19321","The Lighthouse provides a marvellous chamber-drama platform for two actors, Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe, who seize the opportunity with gusto.","90","7984734"
"19322","Though it's made with lots of modern tricks and technology, it's old-fashioned in the best sense, and not just because it's set in the Sixties.","90","1638355"
"19323","This movie is utterly irresistible.","90","913425"
"19324","This time Hitchcock does it all his way, does a splendid job and has a splendid cast to do it with.","90","32976"
"19325","Blending wit and modesty, Mann fits the bill, coming across as an overgrown kid with a good heart, but virtually no practice in relating to others — which is perhaps the thing that makes his experience so profoundly relatable.","90","2582496"
"19326","The story, the acting, the cinematography are all so potent that they overwhelm us in the best way possible. The violence is brutal and graphic, yet compelling. [23 Sep 1992]","90","104691"
"19327","The result is a masterpiece of moving pieces, a dizzying and obscenely beautiful film that boils down Tolstoy's text to its most basic elements by making literal the theater of high society.","90","1781769"
"19328","Cronenberg's follow-up to ""A History of Violence"" -- starring the same lead, Viggo Mortensen, in a very different part -- lacks the theoretical dimension of its predecessor, but it's no less masterful in its fluid storytelling and shocking choreography of violence.","90","765443"
"19329","With brilliant dialogue out of the 1940s and graceful visuals that add depth to the dark comedy, Johnson debuts with a smart, self-assured feature that portrays adolescence like no other film has.","90","393109"
"19330","Rich in detail, vivid in characterization, leisurely in exposition, this 207-minute epic is bravura filmmaking -- a brilliant yet facile synthesis of Hollywood pictorialism, Soviet montage, and Japanese theatricality that could be a B western transposed to Mars.","90","47478"
"19331","Few actors can be as convincing as leaders of men, and to see Crowe as Capt. Jack Aubrey in Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World is to see a consummate performer doing what he does best.","90","311113"
"19332","In an age of post-Christian facetiousness, Martin Scorsese's work daringly attempts to restore passion and melodrama to the Gospel story. Protests notwithstanding, the film is an affirmation of faith in the power of both the Gospel and the movies.","90","95497"
"19333","Perhaps Strangers on a Train still hasn't yielded all its secrets.","90","44079"
"19334","It does show us, in threads deftly woven, how circumstances can push hard against people, making everyday living a battle.","90","5362988"
"19335","Wiseman’s true subject here is arguably off-screen, shamed by example, guilty in absentia: the erosion of democratic values and civil, civic debate in an increasingly divided country.","90","12094720"
"19336","Neil Marshall's horrifically terrific The Descent cannily recasts 1972's ""Deliverance"" as a female-bonding thriller with some ""Hills Have Eyes""-style mutant terror tossed in for truly harrowing effect.","90","435625"
"19337","An intentional heehaw at whodunits, an uproarious parody that may become a classic of caricature...Sophisticated? Well, not really. But fast, smart, shrewdly directed and capably performed. And though the film will scarcely eradicate the sex and violence that encumber contemporary movies, it may at least persuade producers that sick subjects may be profitably proffered with a healthy laugh.","90","57076"
"19338","The surprisingly effective Moneyball has a smart script, solid direction and great performances.","90","1210166"
"19339","What sets Jaws apart from most of the other ceiling busters and makes it a special case, like ""The Godfather,"" is that it is quite a good movie. For one thing, it is mercifully free of the padding—cosmic, comic, cultural—that so often mars ""big"" pictures. In that sense, the movie is very like its subject. If the great white shark that terrorizes the beaches of an island summer colony is one of nature's most efficient killing machines, Jaws is an efficient entertainment machine.","90","73195"
"19340","It's a star-driven mass-market entertainment that's smart, exciting and unexpected while not stinting on genre satisfactions.","90","1631867"
"19341","A superbly written loony-tunes satire, played by a tony cast at the top of its game.","90","1234548"
"19342","The next worst thing to being there. That's how real it feels.","90","265086"
"19343","Tenet is a film that will stay with you forever from its first scene, one that will tempt you to revisit it in part or as a whole, and that really tells you what it is: a masterpiece.","90","6723592"
"19344","As a thriller, The Town has what it takes and then some.","90","840361"
"19345","Movie stars radiate a power -- physical, erotic, spiritual -- that draws an audience into their orbit. Yet watching Curtis Hanson's gritty and electrifying 8 Mile, the first thing you notice about Eminem, the most scaldingly powerful artist in pop music today, is how vulnerable he looks.","91","298203"
"19346","Nearly four decades ago, Pontecorvo anatomized the very form of modern terrorist warfare: the hidden cells, the cultish leaders, the brutish cycle of attack and counterattack.","91","58946"
"19347","There’s a breathless sense of discovery and play that makes the film seem new, even as it’s tap-dancing through the imprints of so many sci-fi stories throughout the years. Simply put, superhero movies don’t often carry this sense of possibility anymore.","91","4633694"
"19348","Green Book is not the deepest depiction of racism, but it is a funny and heartwarming depiction of a friendship, forged in a car.","91","6966692"
"19349","Miller’s New York, full of academics who still have the capacity to act like children, isn’t exactly new, but plenty fascinating.","91","3471098"
"19350","Some people will think it’s a bizarre mess, others an unconventional masterwork. If there’s any justice in the world, the latter group will win out.","91","5294550"
"19351","Skyfall doesn't forget it has to be an exciting spy film above all, but from its first scene, it ratchets up the drama in ways that have little to do with action.","91","1074638"
"19352","Reminds us of just how exciting and satisfying the fantasy cinema can be when it's approached with imagination and flair.","91","145487"
"19353","Now You See Me can’t quite claim to be the ideal crime drama – that would be “The Usual Suspects,” which justly won an Oscar for its script – but it’s only one level down.","91","1670345"
"19354","Talbot has a gift for making twee material feel true, but his grip weakens during the pivotal home stretch of his debut, and as a result the ending doesn’t land with the emotion it deserves.","91","4353250"
"19355","A drama that embraces the ambiguities and contradictions of family ties and human nature in all its irrational glory.","91","203230"
"19356","Clint Eastwood’s Sully is not a perfect film, but it comes close to being a great one as it turns the real-life emergency landing of a passenger plane in the Hudson River into a meditation on duty and crisis that’s more Bertolt Brecht than “based on a true story.”","91","3263904"
"19357","There's a bittersweet quality to McCandless' story that Penn captures intuitively.","91","758758"
"19358","Funny, irreverent and moving, the unconventional Shrek may mock fairy tales, but in the process, creates its own.","91","126029"
"19359","Though Hall's stunning vistas and gorgeous exploration of wide-open spaces hearken back to John Ford, Butch Cassidy otherwise radiates the youthful energy, manic pop playfulness, and antic clowning of the French New Wave.","91","64115"
"19360","Here, in paranoid, bad acid trip form, is the real birth of girl power. [2000 re-release]","91","70047"
"19361","This funny, gory stab-athon is as sophisticated about the mechanics of Part 2s as the original was savvy about horror flicks.","91","120082"
"19362","By an order of magnitude --- the strongest (or at least the most mature, subtle and emotional) entry in the series thus far.","91","417741"
"19363","It's witty, gripping good fun.","91","372784"
"19364","A landmark film, the unnecessary tinkering has not perceptibly harmed its overall effectiveness and it's a special Halloween treat to see it digitally spruced up and on the big screen for the first time in 25 years.","91","78748"
"19365","This one, as thoughtful as it is rousing, scores a TKO.","91","964517"
"19366","In order to enjoy the myriad pleasures of del Toro’s world — with all its counterpointed humor, quicksilver pacing, endearing humanity, peculiar eroticism, and sudden eruptions of violence — one must simply take the plunge.","91","5580390"
"19367","Rabbit Hole is a tremendously sad movie, but it's also the furthest thing from a miserablist wallow.","91","935075"
"19368","And the movie stands as a fitting memorial to River Phoenix, whose performance lingered in my mind for days after seeing it. [12 Nov 1993]","91","108327"
"19369","A visually stunning, richly imagined oasis in a sea of candy-colored safety, and one of the first truly original movies of the year so far.","91","4302938"
"19370","Turns the tricks of psychology into duplicitous high play.","91","140397"
"19371","Martha Coolidge's bright, whimsical Real Genius can credit part of its substantial and richly deserved cult following to the fact that nothing has changed: Raunchy, lowbrow teen comedies are forever in vogue, and SDI is still an impossible, money-sucking political mirage.","91","89886"
"19372","This is a movie about, among other things, pain, and it's made by someone who understands its expression.","91","1193138"
"19373","A florid, often lurid, completely enthralling film held in place by a disarming Portman, who rarely leaves the frame.","91","947798"
"19374","No comic trope, however musty or studded with whiskers, is off limits, including bad puns, physical shtick, pie fights, goofy names and accents, song-and-dance numbers, Jewish Indians, or just having a bunch of cowpokes farting around the campfire. Some of the jokes drop like lead, but the film's anarchic spirit carries a lot of excitement, because Brooks' anything-goes philosophy means that no comedic possibilities go unconsidered.","91","71230"
"19375","Enabling and mocking paranoid obsession at the same time might sound incoherent. In this hilariously demented spin on L.A. noir, it’s simply honest.","91","5691670"
"19376","Cumberbatch radiates such intelligence — with Sherlock and this, egghead Benedict is his speciality — that gaps are easily excused. From sets and costumes to Alexandre Desplat's musical score, The Imitation Game is everything classy that Hollywood wishes it could be.","91","2084970"
"19377","The Man Who Knew Too Much finds the director firmly back in his wheelhouse, extracting all the wit and suspense he can from a pulpy exercise in abduction and conspiracy.","91","49470"
"19378","Although not exactly heartwarming, Amour has a more contained vision of human relationships than Haneke's previous films without sacrificing its bleak foundation. It's his most conventional movie about death -- and the most poignant.","91","1602620"
"19379","Broad and funny, its sensibility is very campy and it's out to be loved by everyone.","91","427327"
"19380","It's a summery idyll: his most entertaining picture since ""Bullets Over Broadway"" (1994) or maybe ""Sweet and Lowdown"" (1999).","91","497465"
"19381","Just as the brothers themselves love to present dialectics about the duality of triviality and seriousness, so, too, does Hail, Caesar! constantly skate back and forth between feeling slight and monumental.","91","475290"
"19382","To watch it now is to appreciate more than ever Gene Hackman’s uncompromising talent, Owen Roizman’s great, barely-color cinematography, and a time when the spectacle of a foulmouthed, racist, brutal cop could still outrage as many moviegoers as it excited.","91","67116"
"19383","It’s easy to see why people hated a movie as arch, violent, and glib as Dressed To Kill, and equally clear that this is exactly what De Palma was going for with all the gusto he could muster.","91","80661"
"19384","Despite the darker edges, I, Tonya embraces the surreality of the story and winningly plays it mostly for comedy, with dips into drama, while crucially never mocking the central players.","91","5580036"
"19385","Brigsby Bear is easily the biggest surprise film of the year and is worth every laugh and tear that it brings.","91","5805752"
"19386","The meat of Wells’ novel is sacrificed in favor of all-out spectacle, but in that respect the movie works marvelously.","91","54387"
"19387","Scott’s sci-fi adventure is the kind of film you leave the theater itching to tell your friends to see. Like Apollo 13 and Gravity, it turns science and problem solving into an edge-of-your-seat experience.","91","3659388"
"19388","I had to see the new version twice to realize that there's so much to appreciate about this multilayered production.","91","1340800"
"19389","It's not every day you get to see a movie that begins in satire and ends in reverence, but then, for Kevin Smith, they may ultimately be the same thing.","91","120655"
"19390","It's the electric interplay between Pacino and Depp that will make it a Mob movie classic.","91","119008"
"19391","A protagonist of stunted emotional growth is simply assumed from Apatow at this stage, but Schumer’s perspective and voice translates to a wealth of gags that breathe new life into the idea.","91","3152624"
"19392","At once spare and dense, chilly and thrilling, literate and visceral, it feeds in gray areas, teasing ambiguities and conundrums out of shadows and making strengths of inconclusiveness and uncertainty.","91","465538"
"19393","It's the best film McCarthy has ever made: restrained, intelligent and grown-up, but unfolding with the pacing and rhythm of a thriller.","91","1895587"
"19394","This is harsh and acid stuff, but it's exhilarating on a number of counts. For one thing, Jenkins moves with real authority between scenes of low life, tender intimacy and gripping violence; made on the cheap, her film has the iron certainty of the best art.","91","340855"
"19395","An absorbing and fulfilling experience -- even though it ends with a question mark.","91","443706"
"19396","While there's an element of left-wing fantasy in Lemmon's conversion from unquestioning patriot to newly awakened skeptic of U.S. covert activities, Lemmon's emotional directness, driven by a need simply to find answers, makes that transition entirely plausible. Within this decent citizen lies the conscience of a nation.","91","84335"
"19397","As writer/director, he manages to make both Morrison and the period seem real without being self-conscious, an observed milieu rather than a film set. [01 Mar 1991]","91","101761"
"19398","It shows us how rare love is — and how we need to grab it and not let it go.","91","2390361"
"19399","Masterfully played by Annette Bening, Dorothea is a fascinating character of contradictions.","91","4385888"
"19400","Though it's unflinching in its depiction of homosexual affection, the marvel of the movie is the dexterity with which it transcends the specificity of its characters and gay theme to be a universal human statement and profound political epic.","91","1013753"
"19401","A bare outline of the plot reads like a space-adventure thriller with end-of-the-world stakes and a hint of celestial spirituality, and the haunted spaceship twist in the third act is pure B-movie madness.","91","448134"
"19402","It’s easily the most suspenseful American film of the year, a thriller that feels like lightning across a quiet night sky; sudden, terrifying, and excitingly singular.","91","2359024"
"19403","It’s like a lost John Hughes movie with Irish brogues and cars that just happen to drive on the other side of the road. It’s also, sadly, exactly the kind of sweet little film that too often gets buried in a box office ruled by broader comedies and bloated superhero epics","91","3544112"
"19404","If Linklater goes to a bit of an extreme here, it's in making both characters so intelligent and sincere, so ardent and giving, that they seem a little too good to believe.","91","112471"
"19405","Like ""In the Bedroom,"" the film is studded with brilliant acting, and it's all rendered with gorgeously fluent technique. The result is a film that skirts cruelty and easy satire for deep, troubling realities -- a nearly thorough triumph, in short.","91","404203"
"19406","Unfolding like a symphony of small humiliations, there isn’t a moment in this movie that doesn’t feel at least vaguely familiar, and there isn’t a moment in this movie that doesn’t feel completely true.","91","1878870"
"19407","Though Davis makes Tully convincing both as a human being and as a mysterious godsend, it’s Theron whose work is absolutely vital to Tully’s success.","91","5610554"
"19408","Nerve-rattling in the best way, the sharp, visceral urban police procedural End of Watch is one of the best American cop movies I've seen in a long time.","91","1855199"
"19409","The Matrix slams you back in your chair, pops open your eyes and leaves your jaw hanging slack in amazement.","91","133093"
"19410","It's a raw and honest film, and it keeps its feet firmly on the ground, even as The Ram flies through the air to deliver -- or receive -- another beating in the squared circle of life.","91","1125849"
"19411","Badham and company elide a lot of technical details of hacking, but the basics of the nascent computer culture still feel spot-on, right down to the body type and personalities of Eddie Deezen and Maury Chaykin, who play two of Broderick's techno-literate confederates (and work in Seattle, no less). More important is how WarGames plays up the contrast between teenagers—rebellious on the surface but conformist by nature—with a cynical adult world that has become convinced that nuclear annihilation might not be so bad.","91","86567"
"19412","Back to the Future doesn't exactly leap out of the starting gate, and some scenes are strung out by gimmicky editing. But the story picks up steam as it goes along, and the last third is especially full of speedy surprises. [3 July 1985, p.23]","91","88763"
"19413","I find it the most adventurous and imaginative American film I've seen this year - and also the weirdest.","91","103776"
"19414","Resonant examination of friendship, fame, cultural trends, and the creative process.","91","122529"
"19415","The most original and excitingly executed wow-factor-meets-handheld-video feature since ""Blair Witch"" itself. It's also a movie that rebuilds the power of special effects from the ground up.","91","1706593"
"19416","Despite wild deviations in spiritual themes and execution, nothing in Noah approaches sacrilege or surrender, making this an acutely sensible biblical epic. It may simply be too strange for the masses to notice.","91","1959490"
"19417","Like ""Far From Heaven,"" Carol mines society’s narrow-mindedness and the dangers of living a double life. But what was true more than a half century ago remains true now: The heart wants what it wants, society and propriety be damned.","91","2402927"
"19418","After two hours of dazzlingly fantastical images and stomach-turning gore, del Toro winds around, and finds his story's center.","91","457430"
"19419","Every family is its own country with culture and customs and embarrassments that seem alien beyond its borders, but the genius of Maren Ade‘s brilliantly funny and slyly crushing Toni Erdmann is that it makes the utterly foreign nation of its central father/daughter relationship feel so much like home.","91","4048272"
"19420","Bracingly perceptive about the human comedy.","91","1174732"
"19421","De Palma’s exuberant style comes to perfect use when dream and reality become thus entwined: as soon as Jake and Gloria’s lips meet, the camera starts encircling the couple frenetically, as though struggling to capture this spiral of pure pleasure, while a green screen projection of the beach replaces the real one.","91","86984"
"19422","It’s an incredibly melancholy, intimate and yet often hilarious look at relationships and connection that provides a surprisingly great deal of insight into the human condition. It’s both sweet and considered, as well as observant about our fears, masks and growing alienation.","91","1798709"
"19423","Young Frankenstein (1974) and High Anxiety are as much loving homage as irreverent spoof.","91","72431"
"19424","On the surface, Grandma is a simple story, but the script imbues it with deep reserves of emotional depth and meaning that are slowly, organically revealed over the course of the plot.","91","4270516"
"19425","With a haunting Brad Pitt performance at the center of an existentially arresting personal journey, Ad Astra feels like the boldest, most considered major studio movie we’re going to get for a long time.","91","2935510"
"19426","The makers of The Brady Bunch Movie have too much affection for the show simply to skewer it with satire. What they’ve done is closer to alchemy: turned this cheese into comic gold.","91","112572"
"19427","Baumbach uses this twisted reunion as a brilliant funnel for all of his world-building — and it’s quite a story, broken down into multiple sections, no less. Yes, he goes nuts with the exposition, but there’s little offense here considering, well, that’s exactly how it would go down in reality.","91","5536736"
"19428","We laugh, yes, but we're touched, too, a delicate balance that the film manages again and again, right through to its bittersweet conclusion.","91","257360"
"19429","Cholodenko's casually observant style perfectly matches the cast's thoughtful work, though the film ultimately proves more successful at creating messy situations than trying to resolve them.","91","842926"
"19430","Room is simply a movie about mother and son trying to adapt to the outside world after years of forced captivity. And the surprise is how succinctly it captures this drastic life change from the perspective of five-year-old.","91","3170832"
"19431","Mixing horror movie imagery with honest, heart-wrenching human truths, Bayona has created a dark, coming-of-age masterpiece.","91","3416532"
"19432","And, of course, the film's biggest selling point is the performance of China's reigning superstar, Gong Li. Playing a sexy, shrewd but strangely suicidal character who is a far cry from the stubborn courtesans and determined peasant women characters that made her famous, she's as enigmatic and irresistible as ever, and demonstrates once again that she is the Garbo of China. [21 Dec 1995]","91","115012"
"19433","Renner gives a full-bore performance of great individuality and industriousness, but essentially his character is as glamorized as any classic Westerner.","91","887912"
"19434","For all its scenes of degradation (five minutes of which have been shorn for an R-rated cut; we recommend the original NC-17 version), Bad Lieutenant is a deeply moral movie. It's not pretty-it's not even very realistic-but it does matter.","91","103759"
"19435","Batman is perfect summertime fare. Its secret is levity hidden in a dark and troubled soul.. [23 June 1989, p.6]","91","96895"
"19436","Touching and brimming with the energy, enthusiasm and tides of teenage love and life, 'Perks' could very well be the next classic of the genre.","91","1659337"
"19437","For a certain brand of film geek, the best news about The Ladykillers is that it isn't a Tom Hanks movie. It's a Coen brothers movie.","91","335245"
"19438","It happens to be splendidly acted and to be poised, as a narrative, on a knife's edge (the final shot, at a great moment of indecision, is utterly haunting). But, chiefly, it's a portrait of an essential and sympathetic human dilemma, and in that it's both real and timeless in ways that transcend borders, cultures and languages.","91","1832382"
"19439","For all the influences glowing dimly under its skin, You Were Never Really Here remains its own bewildering animal, unmistakably Ramsay’s.","91","5742374"
"19440","As a writer and director, Hill demonstrates an endearing and encouraging empathy for his characters, crafting a portrait of adolescence that allows every emotion and every decision — from the most relatable at any age to the most boneheaded — to exist without irony, judgement, or condescension.","91","5613484"
"19441","Hanks towers as a near naked, near biblical man. Zemeckis tells his story -- the screenplay is by William Broyles -- with a control magnificent in what isn't shown as much as in what is.","91","162222"
"19442","In a movie era when brand names mean very little, it shows once again that Pixar is a stamp of quality.","91","317705"
"19443","Harmony Korine's first ''mainstream'' movie, Spring Breakers, is by far the best thing he's ever done.","91","2101441"
"19444","Warrior is a surprising gut punch, a modern-day ""Rocky"" saga with two mixed martial arts pugs trying to beat, choke and kick the system.","91","1291584"
"19445","While it has many familiar ingredients — from the atmosphere to the ensemble of Anderson regulars in nearly every role — in its allegiance to Anderson's vision, everything about The Grand Budapest Hotel is a welcome dose of originality.","91","2278388"
"19446","It's not hard to imagine these characters in a straight-faced Hollywood blockbuster. And that's the source of Hot Fuzz's genius, pointing out the thin line that separates convention from farce when Hollywood starts throwing its special effects around.","91","425112"
"19447","Even the finest troupe of thespians would be wasted without Allen's guiding hand as writer and director. But Blue Jasmine, which might rank among Allen's 10 best films, shows what can happen when it all comes together.","91","2334873"
"19448","Potter 3 is, in its heart of hearts, a teenage angst movie...Cuaron has done a masterful job of bringing off this shift in the Potter paradigm without disrupting any disruption in the established style of the series and without any pandering concessions to the teen-movie genre.","91","304141"
"19449","Parker jams South Park with so much comic ""stuff"" that the effect is dizzying, at least for those who haven't left the auditorium in a huff before the end.","91","158983"
"19450","The film belongs to Chapman and more than anyone, MacKay, a 27-year-old Londoner with the long bones and baleful eyes of a porcelain saint or a lost Caulkin brother. His Lance Corporal Schofield isn’t just a surrogate Everyman; he’s hope and fear personified, and you couldn’t look away if you wanted to.","91","8579674"
"19451","Probably the most faithful to the writer's tortured spirit. It's the kind of movie that gets under your skin - and stays there.","91","405296"
"19452","I will say that it's been a while since a romantic comedy mustered this much charm by looking this much like life.","91","1405365"
"19453","The Interview is laugh out loud funny all the way through, and once again proves that Rogen and Goldberg will do anything, no matter how dark, for a big laugh, and that character is just as important as punchlines in their work.","91","2788710"
"19454","Don't be fooled: In this unpeaceable kingdom, the den mama is also ready to eat her young.","91","1313092"
"19455","Corbet’s second feature owes a debt or two to filmmakers reveling in provocation, but it is no doubt the work of a daring original.","91","5960374"
"19456","The movie is literally a series of showstoppers, unified by the impulse to turn life, at its scruffiest, into theater - into a rhapsody of the everyday.","91","294870"
"19457","Some will find the surprise pleasant, others unpleasant. Whatever it is, it's the least commercial, most somberly heartfelt movie ever made by the cinema's most commercially successful filmmaker.","91","408306"
"19458","Peter Berg's scandalous sick-joke thriller is packed with rude and clever twists, and it delves, with surprising force, into the hypocritical postures of corporate-era male bonding. The cast is terrific, especially Christian Slater.","91","124198"
"19459","It’s a daring, cynical gem.","91","52561"
"19460","The brilliance of the movie lies in how it starts from a familiar place, then sneaks into transcendence.","91","7653254"
"19461","Funny, pungent, and weirdly gripping.","91","144084"
"19462","Although the changes to the source material are guaranteed to polarize some Stephen King fans, Pet Sematary bucks the remake trap of simply paying homage to an iconic piece of horror. Instead, it makes drastic changes to the plot so it can ultimately go more complex with its themes. That’s a hell of a trick to pull off. Sometimes, different is better.","91","837563"
"19463","It's an exercise in metafiction that, while providing grisly fun, never distances viewers. And it's entertaining, while asking the same question of viewers and characters alike: Why come to a place you knew all along was going to be so dark and dangerous?","91","1259521"
"19464","Wan masterfully tightens the vise on the audience's nerves, using mood and sound effects for shocks that never feel cheap (the harmless kids' game of hide-and-clap has never been so bloodcurdling).","91","1457767"
"19465","Is it possible to have yet another expensive excursion into this genre that seems in any way fresh, original and alive? The answer, surprisingly, is yes.","91","371746"
"19466","Scott briskly blends the high-minded stuff with impressive boo-and-goo sequences, ratcheting tension in tight spots and dark caverns.","91","1446714"
"19467","The movie is an impressively realized work of minimalist storytelling that foregrounds Redford's physicality more than any other role in his celebrated career. His performance defines the movie to an almost shockingly experimental degree.","91","2017038"
"19468","Watching it isn't easy, but it is definitely worth having waited for.","91","1242460"
"19469","For a film where every single scene is rigidly contained within a screen — framed by an iPhone FaceTime chat, a laptop exchange, TV image, home movie or security camera surveillance — Searching has a surprising sense of momentum.","91","7668870"
"19470","The one scene with a hint of the eccentrically detached brilliance that would come to define ”Stanley Kubrick Movies” is the climactic battle, in which marching blocks of Roman soldiers are mowed down by fire: It’s war as the greatest halftime show ever choregraphed. Until then, Spartacus envelops you in the sort of bedazzled hero worship Hollywood never quite managed to bring off this rousingly again.","91","54331"
"19471","So far in this year's cartoon feature sweepstakes, Shrek the Third rules.","91","413267"
"19472","It transcends its genre even as it fulfills it.","91","6644200"
"19473","Dench and Coogan's chemistry is undeniably great. In the end, he manages to give her the answers she seeks and she manages to give him a heart.","91","2431286"
"19474","Guadagnino dredges up the dead with such crazed purpose that his magnum opus is able to dance through its rough spots and make good on its foreboding promise.","91","1034415"
"19475","Perhaps the most ingeniously imaginative element in Son of Rambow, a film exploding with imagination (some of it scrawled directly over the film in animated expressions of Will's private world), is its very conceit.","91","845046"
"19476","A movie of tough excitement and surprise, even grace.","91","405159"
"19477","Tasked with meeting the many requirements necessary for any Avengers movie to work, Whedon checks off all the boxes, then sets about creating new expectations for what a big superhero movie ought to be.","91","848228"
"19478","McCarthy elevates the material at every opportunity, and whenever the camera lingers on her expressions, she’s a study in contradictions — tough and tender all at once, unsure which side of that spectrum to unleash.","91","4595882"
"19479","It's a comedy of manhood for the age of emasculation.","91","1386588"
"19480","In the movie's final shot, Jung's confidence crumbles and he looks supremely troubled, still uncertain of a world he once believed could be explained with textual prowess. Better than any analysis, his expression sums up the dangerous method at the heart of every Cronenberg movie.","91","1571222"
"19481","In the main this is a muscular, exact and thrillingly cool movie.","91","477348"
"19482","A muscular, honorable, unflinching translation of Collins' vision. It's brutal where it needs to be, particularly when children fight and bleed.","91","1392170"
"19483","Kineticism and suspense, combined with strongly conceived characters....Made Cameron a talent to watch. [13 Jan 1995, p. 67]","91","88247"
"19484","It says something, then, that Burton's best, most enjoyable, and most emotionally resonate film in years is actually an adaptation of one of his very first projects: Frankenweenie.","91","1142977"
"19485","A tale of ordinary Americans scraping bottom, yet there's a redemption in that. The film asks: If you were this desperate, wouldn't you do the same?","91","978759"
"19486","The generous, sharp performances, especially Garai's, deepen the story's emotional impact, as does Wright's assured, frequently astounding direction.","91","783233"
"19487","[A] furious and fiendishly well-crafted new film. ... Giddy one moment, unbearably tense the next, and always so entertaining and fine-tuned that you don’t even notice when it’s changing gears, “Parasite” takes all of the beats you expect to find in a Bong film and shrinks them down with clockwork precision.","91","6751668"
"19488","The intensity is too much to bear in the best possible way. Legrand knows exactly where to position his characters and what’s necessary to break them. It’s a steady crescendo of suspense despite his source of danger never shifting.","91","6002232"
"19489","mother! begins as a slow-burn and builds towards a furious blaze. Awash in both religious and contemporary political imagery, Darren Aronofsky’s allusive film certainly opens itself to a number of allegorical readings, but it also works as a straight-ahead head rush.","91","5109784"
"19490","The Aviator, though, if not prime Scorsese, is the closest thing in a long time to the old Scorsese. What a splendid year-end gift!","91","338751"
"19491","Sensational sex-and-its-consequences melodrama.","91","250797"
"19492","Hartnett and co-star Scarlett Johansson--that most fatale of current filmic femmes--are naturals for this kind of noir-hued material, but the pairing of Ellroy and De Palma proves a marriage made in hardboiled heaven.","91","387877"
"19493","It’s a twinkling surface examination of how humans try to coordinate their dreams with their reality (a very Hollywood conundrum), but also a celebration of just how wonderful old filmmaking techniques and emotions look and feel on modern L.A. streets.","91","3783958"
"19494","Easily one of the year’s best comedies, the movie thrives off the chemistry between its leads, with Pegg painting a very funny portrait of emotional paralysis and Frost demonstrating a heretofore unseen talent for intimidation.","91","1213663"
"19495","At two hours and 32 minutes, this is almost too much movie, but it has a malicious, careening zest all its own. It's a ride for the gut AND the brain.","91","468569"
"19496","Superb psychological thriller.","91","278504"
"19497","Queen & Slim is an extraordinary Black Odyssey; a film whose tracks reverberate with echoes of the underground railroad.","91","8722346"
"19498","This is an especially personal work, anchored by the director’s on-off muse Antonio Banderas in perhaps his greatest performance and sweeps through the Spanish maestro’s recurrent themes: high melodrama and kitsch comedy, piety and carnal lust, sex and death, human pain and transcendent glory.","91","8291806"
"19499","Calvary may not be for all audiences, with its pitch-black heart and sober existentialism not exactly commercial stuff, but its unwavering commitment to the intelligent thorniness of its themes, and the masterful control McDonagh exerts over the shifts in tone are worth cherishing, bringing it soaring close to something divine.","91","2234003"
"19500","In effect, Caden's life passes before his eyes while he is living it. And Kaufman shares this effect with us through a strange process he achieves with invisible strings; it's a knockout.","91","383028"
"19501","This is a remarkable, triumphant, and confident picture by Aster, who gives the film an almost meditative-like sensation, as you feel every space you’re in, every emotion, every moment of grief. Hereditary refuses to employ cheap thrills, creating its cinematic scares with atmosphere, and continuously reinventing itself at every turn.","91","7784604"
"19502","Creed does justice to its roots while trying something new.","91","3076658"
"19503","It’s “Veep” in the Soviet Union, a welcome expansion of Iannucci’s canvas that keeps his savage comedy intact.","91","4686844"
"19504","The remarkable thing about Smith in The Lady in the Van is that, even though the role is no longer fresh for her, the performance certainly is. She gives it everything she’s got because, you feel, she wants to honor this character. She wants Miss Shepherd to live on.","91","3722070"
"19505","There's a slightness to Postcards From the Edge, and a little too much satirical self-help jargon (the story is all about how Suzanne learns to like herself). But the movie captures — and celebrates — how easy it is to turn your problems into show biz.","91","100395"
"19506","An exhilarating piece of epic filmmaking that it pulls you in, sweeps you up and works very much as its own thing.","91","332452"
"19507","The playful performances haven't aged, and it still finds all the carefree thrills of being young, dumb, in love with life, and ready for death.","91","61418"
"19508","Days after I saw The Artist, I was still thinking (and grinning) about it, because the movie's real romance is the one between us, the jaded 21st-century audience, and the mechanical innocence of old movies, which here becomes new again.","91","1655442"
"19509","As told through Heller’s acutely sensitive vision, the result is less off-putting and more of an authentic insight into a perspective grossly underrepresented in American cinema.","91","3172532"
"19510","It's the beaming movie-star intensity of the complicated comic Carrey in the role of the dominant lover and Obi-Wan Kenobi McGregor as the gentle beloved that makes this unfettered, stranger-than-fiction picture pop.","91","1045772"
"19511","The most important thing, though, is that we come away feeling we know him. He died on Christmas Day eight years ago, and people listening to samples of his music in rap and hip-hop may have no idea why he mattered. Now they’ll see.","91","2473602"
"19512","The film may be bloody, but it's also bloody gorgeous: a grandly fetishized epic of cinematic aggression. It's a tale of vengeance that hinges on Tarantino's love of ferocity as spectacle -- his immersion in action and exploitation, his addiction to the jazzy catharsis of junk-film kicks.","91","266697"
"19513","It's eye-filling, well-cast, often very funny and executed with great imagination and flair.","91","241527"
"19514","Changeling doesn't care if you love it or hate it, it makes no compromises to fashion and it's charged with that unmistakable assurance of a master filmmaker at his creative peak.","91","824747"
"19515","Like ""Afterschool,"" Durkin's first feature explores the dangerous extremes of youth vulnerability.","91","1441326"
"19516","Like the toy it's based on, it's goofy and colorful and something adults and children can enjoy together.","91","1490017"
"19517","In many ways, though, Gremlins is ingenious. Gizmo yanks at your heartstrings with both furry fists, then sits out a few scenes while suspense builds, then plunges back with more vim than ever. The small-town setting, right out of a gushy Frank Capra movie, manages to be timeless, nostalgic, and slightly ridiculous all at once.","91","87363"
"19518","This is a delicious premise, and Blomkamp, who first played with it in a 2005 short called ""Alive in Joburg,"" has magnified and improved it with ferocious energy, wit and style.","91","1136608"
"19519","Deeply resonant and soulful, Life Of Pi, is a harrowing journey of survival, self-discovery and connection that both inspires and awes in equal measure.","91","454876"
"19520","Christopher Nolan’s terrific new film, Dunkirk, is powered by an engine of combusting contradictions: it’s at once minimalist and maximalist, cynical and dopey, a big-boy white elephant art film that is actually a lean and mean suspense set-piece machine.","91","5013056"
"19521","It's a film in which complex issues are boiled down to human essences, not so much simplified as dramatized in the very best way.","91","285742"
"19522","At every turn, Fisher is honest and open, relatable to the point that you feel as if you’re actually watching her own life play out.","91","7014006"
"19523","More meditation than movie, Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life is bound to mystify, awe and exasperate in equal measures.","91","478304"
"19524","A dizzyingly tense and creepy workout.","91","3235888"
"19525","It's undoubtedly something extraordinary: like a live-action Miyazaki film, with Days Of Heaven narration, set in a dirt-poor community at an unspecified time of crisis.","91","2125435"
"19526","The plot's many complications pretty much all add up, which is a rarity these days for a murder mystery. It's possible that audiences don't even care anymore if a film makes sense as long it's entertaining.","91","488120"
"19527","A disorienting puzzle of a movie with many exhilarating pieces, Anomalisa nevertheless maintains a straightforward trajectory involving Michael's internal strife.","91","2401878"
"19528","A highly entertaining, informative movie about how the subprime mortgage crisis led to a worldwide financial meltdown in 2007-08. The fact that such a movie is so unusual is one big reason why the meltdown occurred and why it easily could happen again.","91","1596363"
"19529","There’s no doubt that Gangs of Wasseypur is an exhilarating creation, a not-to-be-missed cinematic event, and a work as sprawling, messy, and open-ended as real life.","91","1954470"
"19530","It’s a film of overwhelming empathy and playfulness as loneliness turns into gratification and desires are slowly manifested into reality.","91","5726616"
"19531","[Stone's] filmmaking is so supple and alive, his obsession with the visual aspect of history so electrifying, that JFK practically roots itself in your imagination.","91","102138"
"19532","It's a gorgeously rendered marvel that pulls out all the stops to wow its viewers, but in spite of its crowd-pleasing ploys, it holds onto its integrity with a smart and surprisingly deep story.","91","366548"
"19533","Totally bonkers, hilarious and wickedly clever, The Double is special and singular filmmaking at its best.","91","1825157"
"19534","That rare animal, a dialogue-driven comedy -- and a good one at that. While one or two of its scenes may seem a tad too talky for today's low-attention spans, the script is mostly razor-sharp acerbic and sophisticated.","91","368709"
"19535","The Spectacular Now doesn't shrink from being an all-out teen movie (it has hookups and a senior prom). Yet it's one of the rare truly soulful and authentic teen movies. It's about the experience of being caught on the cusp and not knowing which way you'll land.","91","1714206"
"19536","99 Homes is by no means a perfect film, but it can achieve something more precious, and rarer than glossy perfection: it can take you by the shoulders and shake the apathy and complacency away.","91","2891174"
"19537","By making this look like the sort of film that studios think of when they think of animation, but subverting the very nature of those movies, Sausage Party is more than funny. It’s downright revolutionary.","91","1700841"
"19538","The Last Station isn’t all that it should be, but whenever these two actors are onscreen, it’s like a great night at the theater.","91","824758"
"19539","Crystal turns in his best (read: least sappy) performance in ages, getting through an entire movie -- most of it, anyway -- without mugging.","91","122933"
"19540","Jonathan Demme's long-awaited Philadelphia is so expertly acted, well-meaning and gutsy that you find yourself constantly pulling for it to be the definitive AIDS movie. [14 Jan 1994, p.13]","91","107818"
"19541","The result is less portrait of an artist than snapshot of a brief, meaningful encounter, shared between two men enjoying different stages of professional success. That one of these men happens to be a modern literary hero is almost, if not quite, incidental.","91","3416744"
"19542","It’s a story that begins in an ancient riddle and ends, perfectly, in the rumble of an oncoming storm. It’s about life, A Serious Man is, and it’s as close, I think, as any American narrative movie of recent vintage has come to touching on the uncanniness of it.","91","1019452"
"19543","A slow burn. A portrait of the mundane humor and horror of everyday life, it scalds nerves you may have never thought existed. And yet the film is funny, almost hilariously at times.","91","279113"
"19544","At once a gripping jungle survival thriller and an alluring sci-fi puzzle, Garland’s heady gambit confirms he’s one of the genre’s best working filmmakers.","91","2798920"
"19545","Even though I'm not sure I understand what Stillman was going for minute-to-minute, I was swept away by how original Damsels is, and how funny.","91","1667307"
"19546","Oacks more heat, acid, danger and drama into its brief running time than most films of nearly double the length.","91","465551"
"19547","Biller spins an archly funny — but also hyper-sincere — story about the true price of the patriarchy. There hasn’t been anything quite like it in decades.","91","3908142"
"19548","It exists less as an adaptation than a love letter to the film, its large community of fans, and crazy dreamers everywhere.","91","3521126"
"19549","Rather than smothering the material in bad vibes, the filmmaker uses them to gradually reveal a fascinating world in which anger and resentment becomes the only weapon any of these people know how to wield.","91","5304464"
"19550","Everything is vast and hugely ambitious in Martin Scorsese's magisterial, scrambled historical epic.","91","217505"
"19551","It's built of such exquisite craft -- the acting, the decor, the photography, the music -- that to refuse it is to refuse the very sensations that draw us to art, romance and maybe even life itself.","91","241303"
"19552","A mature, tense, frightening and altogether masterful film.","91","330373"
"19553","Has the resonance to stand not just as a terrific cartoon but as an emotionally pungent movie.","91","110357"
"19554","The sum of the movie is devastating. One takes out of it a sense that the human cost of our endless adventure in Iraq is going to be incalculable, perhaps catastrophic -- a psychological time bomb that will be exploding for decades to come.","91","418763"
"19555","The superb Vega’s steady, liquid, fathomless gaze is so direct that we come to understand that behind it, behind the barricade of defenses she’s built up against an unfriendly world, she is no enigma at all: she is completely known to herself.","91","5639354"
"19556","That the movie succeeds both as a high-stakes crime thriller as well as a far quieter and empathetic study of angry, solitary men proves that Cianfrance has a penchant for bold storytelling and an eye for performances to carry it through.","91","1817273"
"19557","If you can groove with Jarmusch's patient, philosophical indulgences and the wooden exteriors of his characters' lives, the movie rewards with a savvy emotional payoff about moving forward even when the motivation to do so has gone.","91","1714915"
"19558","It has laser gun fights, forbidden love, and a rollicking group breakout from a fascistic old folks' home. What more could anyone want?","91","1371111"
"19559","While a truly original comedy, While We're Young is the rare one that also laces rich thematic elements with wonderfully drawn characters to create a picture that's as genuinely hilarious as it is thoughtful about how hopes, ambitions, dreams and ideals of personal and creative accomplishments that ebb and flow across decades.","91","1791682"
"19560","Wonder Woman is as much about a superhero rising as it is about a world deserving of her, and Diana’s hard-won insistence on battling for humanity (no matter how frequently they disappoint) adds the kind of gravitas and emotion that establishes it as the very best film the DCEU has made yet. There’s only one word for it: wonderful.","91","451279"
"19561","This is the writer-director’s take on the betrayed promise of America: a perverse vision of sadistic men comforted by false causes.","91","3460252"
"19562","The movie might almost be winking at the fact that any single one of these performers could easily be the featured star of his or her own upper-crust period piece.","91","280707"
"19563","What’s so grand about Ruben Brandt isn’t its story or the characters, which are both abstractions. It’s the animation—the detailed artwork, so dense that it warrants repeat viewings.","91","6241872"
"19564","While the movie may be a Western—one of the best Westerns ever made, in fact—it’s also an action movie, one that was crucial to action movies becoming what they would eventually be.","91","65214"
"19565","Letters isn't a fun night at the picture show. It's slow and gloomy and achingly tragic. But it's a truly impressive achievement both in moviemaking and in its understanding of history.","91","498380"
"19566","This is a filmmaker in total command of every visual element — his compositions more compelling than ever, the production design almost verging on steampunk, and a special mention has to go to the extraordinary costumes — but it doesn’t feel stifling or precious either.","91","6864046"
"19567","A deliriously quick-footed and orchestrally pitched character study, Steve Jobs is an ambitious, deeply captivating portrait of the high cost of genius.","91","2080374"
"19568","It's a relentless finale to the ""Bourne"" movie trilogy that raises the stakes, pumps up the action and develops old characters while introducing new villains","91","440963"
"19569","Singularly haunting.","91","69995"
"19570","Birdman dares to be ambiguous, but unlike most essays in ambiguity, it is also a hell of a lot of fun.","91","2562232"
"19571","Full of life, wit, smarts, thrills and sheer gratifying entertainment that it launches the mind on a stream of merry somersaults.","91","796366"
"19572","Hell Or High Water is the kind of movie that makes you fall in love again with the lost art of dialogue, getting you hooked anew on the snap of flavorful conversation.","91","2582782"
"19573","One of the best children's movies in years. Spunky, inventive and filled with life and wonder.","91","129167"
"19574","With his usual intelligence, technical virtuosity (the reverse-aging effects are astounding) and storytelling panache, director Fincher gives the film a power and unity that make nearly three hours go by in a flash and pulls its diverse elements together to be something unique for a Hollywood movie -- a true spiritual experience.","91","421715"
"19575","It's gory and gut-wrenching but strangely life-affirming.","91","1542344"
"19576","It’s a film of stunning beauty and deep underlying sadness, a self-financed labor of love filled with impossibly gorgeous, oft-unclothed men and dazzling eye candy.","91","1315981"
"19577","Blithe and exhilarating romantic comedy.","91","125439"
"19578","Vaughn and his collaborators have taken a crude and disposable property and turned it into something more – a thoughtful, exciting, whip-smart spy adventure that doesn't let its smart-ass post-modernism overwhelm its playfulness or its heart.","91","2802144"
"19579","It's all jolly bad fun, but the primo aspect of the exercise is the phenomenally intense performance by Kingsley as a careening sociopath who is every bit as dangerous to his friends as to his foes.","91","203119"
"19580","It's ultimately a tale of heroism in the face of fearsome, powerful opposition, but as stubborn pride masquerading as ideological purity proves Wilson's Achilles heel, the film's heroes reveal themselves as flawed to an almost fatal extent, and messily, fascinatingly human.","91","977855"
"19581","Breakdown feels at first so casual, so comfortable with its own small expectations (a good but unglamorous cast, a sturdy but unspectacular plot), that the authentic feelings of suspense are a surprise.","91","118771"
"19582","Make no mistake: Poltergeist is a Spielberg film, no matter what the credits say. His stylistic fingerprints are all over the movie, never more so than in the opening third, which turns a suburban haunting into an occasion for Spielbergian movie magic before the ghosts get down to business.","91","84516"
"19583","The movie is an idyllic view of life as it ought to be, rather than the way it is.","91","805564"
"19584","The movie works like a clock. A few minor quibbles aside (the casting of Hitler, for instance), Valkyrie is a highly intelligent and deeply engrossing historical drama and, frame for frame, the year's most suspenseful nail-biter.","91","985699"
"19585","This revolving door of graphically rendered brutalities might feel like its own punishment if not for an array of astonishing performances that’s practically a one-stop Oscar-nomination shopping spree.","91","2024544"
"19586","It never exploits its characters or demands their way of living. For all the hidden misery it uncovers, it remains compassionate and humane from first scene to last.","91","81283"
"19587","It’s as good as screen acting gets.","91","2671706"
"19588","Filled with considerable dread and mystery, 10 Cloverfield Lane functions just fine as a standalone genre title. But as a spiritual sequel to the original, it builds out the so-called ""Cloververse"" far better than could be expected from even the most straightforward of tales.","91","1179933"
"19589","Buoyantly clever and amusing.","91","405422"
"19590","A crackling, devious, and hugely satisfying old-school whodunnit with a modern twist ... Even if you do somehow manage to piece the whole thing together in advance, there’s no way of predicting the joy of watching it all unfold.","91","8946378"
"19591","A master chef preparing an entire feast inside a pressure cooker, Spielberg shoots The Post like every shot was delivered to the studio on a deadline, and the result is a film that combines the spartan clarity of hard journalism with the raw suspense of an Indiana Jones adventure.","91","6294822"
"19592","A big, square, rousing political thriller docudrama.","91","146309"
"19593","Writer-director Jeff Nichols builds his elegantly shot, weather-sensitive horror story in waves of tension that crest as if pulled by tempests.","91","1675192"
"19594","Waititi ... finds such strange, sweet humor in his storytelling that the movie somehow maintains its ballast, even when the tone inevitably (and it feels, necessarily) shifts.","91","2584384"
"19595","The Florida Project further cements Baker’s status as one of the most innovative American directors working today, but he’s also an essential advocate for the stories this country often doesn’t get to see.","91","5649144"
"19596","It breaks so sharply from the practice of contemporary horror film that it requires us to return to the most basic understanding of what it is to be frightened by a movie.","91","185937"
"19597","Burstyn is astonishing, forsaking all vanity to make silly biddy Sara a fully dimensioned human being.","91","180093"
"19598","At times, Frances Ha strains from emphasizing the characters' snarkiness and disregarding plot. By routinely going nowhere, however, the movie eventually finds a distinctive voice that carries it through.","91","2347569"
"19599","Jacob's Ladder is also undeniably spooky. It creates and maintains a mood of paranoia, its special visual effects are original and nightmarish, and it has at least three sequences as haunting as anything I've seen in some time. [2 Nov 1990, p.9]","91","99871"
"19600","Anderson delivers a satisfyingly quirky, cinematically masterful valentine that contains more seeds of truth about the human heart than a hundred big fat Greek comedies.","91","272338"
"19601","The miracle of Nolan's Batman trilogy is the way it imprints those myths with the dread-soaked tenor of the times.","91","1345836"
"19602","This Is 40 isn't always hilarious, but it's ticklishly honest and droll about all the things being a parent can do to a relationship. And why it's still worth it.","91","1758830"
"19603","The Fault in Our Stars beautifully captures the hesitancy, shyness masked by outward confidence, feelings of unworthiness and quiet intensity of teenagers in love.","91","2582846"
"19604","By the picture's knotty finale, in which Audiard navigates a late-stage twist with ease and emotion, you know you are in the hands of a master who is directing with the confidence and command that few possess.","91","2053425"
"19605","Gone Girl is not Fincher's best film, nor is it the most conventionally satisfying of them, but it feels like this is a movie that represents the very best that Hollywood craft can offer at the moment.","91","2267998"
"19606","What's new about the unsensationalized portrait of one-day-at-a-time progress (and setbacks) is the low-key energy of this drunks' tale, by and for a generation with a high tolerance for humor and a low tolerance for soapiness.","91","2063781"
"19607","It lives up to the hype. Gladiator has its creaky moments, but it delivers a particular kind of visceral historical spectacle that movie audiences haven't seen in decades.","91","172495"
"19608","The Reader is significant because -- like another film opening today, ""Valkyrie"" -- it asks us to see not just the Jews but the whole German people as victims of the Holocaust, and to view Nazism as more a product of explicable ignorance than inexplicable evil.","91","976051"
"19609","Sure, showing that girls can be as horny and impulsive and raunchy as guys isn’t exactly the most radical statement. But when it’s done this well, it certainly is a welcome change-up.","91","2531344"
"19610","It assaults us with violence, brutality, sexual confusion and anarchy and has enough bruising, punishing humor to keep us laughing with relief.","91","137523"
"19611","It's crammed full of the dash, filmmaking flair, swashbuckling magic, impossible stunts and tongue-in-cheek humor that made the series such a phenomenon of its time, and -- for those versed in its traditions -- almost every frame is enjoyable on some level.","91","367882"
"19612","Escape From The Planet Of The Apes gets the series back on track, sending three apes back to the 20th century for a story that begins comically and ends in fear and loathing.","91","67065"
"19613","Utilizing a cast of non-actors — most of whom are tasked with playing versions of themselves, in a story pulled from their lives — Zhao’s film derives its power from the truth that both drives it and inspires it, and the final result is a wholly unique slice-of-life drama.","91","6217608"
"19614","Aaron Paul has key scenes as the drone pilot who actually has to pull the trigger, but it’s the late Alan Rickman, as Mirren’s superior, who steals the film.","91","2057392"
"19615","The home-studio recording sequences in Hustle & Flow are funky, rowdy, and indelible. Brewer gives us the pleasure of watching characters create music from the ground up.","91","410097"
"19616","That rare thing at the movies these days: a new experience. It awes us with its technological feat, it sweeps us up in its mystical spell and, with its final scene -- it takes us to an emotional climax of almost unbearable poignancy.","91","318034"
"19617","True Romance is for the most part a delightful relic of its era.","91","108399"
"19618","This is less an examination of a singular person than a look at the torturous and sublime experience of his creative process as it relates to the most important people in his life.","91","5776858"
"19619","Extraordinarily suspenseful, extremely well-told and effortless in its complex tonal balance.","91","1024648"
"19620","A bouncy, well-built, delightfully nasty tale of resentment, desperation, and amoral revenge that does for employer-employee relations what Danny DeVito and Bette Midler did for the bonds of matrimony in the great 1986 Zucker brothers comedy ""Ruthless People.""","91","1499658"
"19621","The movie is a delicious, consistently hilarious screwball farce that gives Clooney his best comedy role to date and should finally, forever, lift the Coens into the wide-release movie mainstream.","91","138524"
"19622","War for the Planet of the Apes is a formidable conclusion (if indeed it is) to one of the more well-considered modern series to date. This is a film of difficult, lingering questions and painful revelations.","91","3450958"
"19623","Another 3-D animated kid movie demonstrates that cartoon storytelling pitched to young people is the last, best refuge of sprightly filmmaking this hard, hot summer.","91","1323594"
"19624","The subtly profound ways in which this movie distorts the recent past makes it one of the most radically entertaining things its iconoclastic scribe has ever written.","91","4209788"
"19625","Bridge Of Spies turns a secret prisoner exchange between the CIA and the KGB into a tense and often disarmingly funny cat-and-mouse game.","91","3682448"
"19626","The picture is often graphic and pulls no punches in its disturbing violence, but its unflinching nature gives it a memorable sear that won't soon be forgotten.","91","1392214"
"19627","The film is an imposing, prismatic achievement, and strongly resistant to an insta-reaction; when it’s over, Nolan still seems a few steps ahead of us.","91","1375666"
"19628","Clooney certainly brings out the best in his actors, but his driving trait as a filmmaker is that he knows what plays - he has an uncanny sense of how to uncork a scene and let it bubble and flow.","91","1124035"
"19629","Gravity lets you visit space without sugarcoating its dangers. It's a brilliant portrait of technology gone wrong that uses it just right.","91","1454468"
"19630","V for Vendetta puts its ideological intent first, and happens to provide smashing entertainment only as a vehicle for delivering its message.","91","434409"
"19631","James Mangold's Logan is an uncommonly mature comic book movie, practically from another universe unto itself. It's a movie demanding and deserving to be taken seriously, an elegy for a mutant.","91","3315342"
"19632","Raimi’s new film feels distinctly unburdened and fun, happily frolicking in its own pulp silliness.","91","1127180"
"19633","Lathan, charismatic and beautifully strong, holds the screen in every scene.","91","199725"
"19634","Essentially two movies for the price of one. But those halves add up to more than most movies right now.","91","387131"
"19635","It sheds the series' famous and influential pastel look and plunges its cast of villains and warriors into the 21st century.","91","430357"
"19636","Ah, monsieur, you can lead a Frenchman to the Big Apple, but you can't make him a New Yorker -- and that's exactly what makes The Professional so fascinating.","91","110413"
"19637","It's an entirely conceived work of art, dark and hopeless and maybe even callous, but glittering and wonderful in its determination and in its craft.","91","243133"
"19638","Underneath, 21 Jump Street is a riot of risks that pay off, the biggest of which might be handing Tatum funny business.","91","1232829"
"19639","At a full three hours, the movie flirts with wearing out its welcome about two-thirds through, but recovers to end up an exhausting, operatic black comedy that leaves you wanting more.","91","993846"
"19640","The Birth of a Nation is one of the most confident writing and directorial debuts in recent memory.","91","4196450"
"19641","MIB3 is one giant leap for mankind because Josh Brolin shows up to play the younger Agent K. And he just nails the feat, triumphantly creating a riff on/homage to the Tommy Lee Jones-ness of K that goes much deeper (and funnier) than a simple imitation of drawl and speech patterns.","91","1409024"
"19642","Campbell is a whirlwind of action -- punching, kicking, pratfalling -- as well as a hilarious parody of a comic book hero. [12 March 1993, p.20]","91","106308"
"19643","Bridges draws us deeply inside Blake’s moment-to-moment heartbreaks. He makes us root for him as we would root for a dear friend. Ultimately, his triumphs become our own.","91","1263670"
"19644","There's much more to the adventure, a deft balance of fantasy and teen angst that never loses its contemporary sense of humor.","91","892769"
"19645","Though shocking violence and black humor run through the length of the movie, what comes through most strongly is its pessimistic political conscience; were the movie less earnest, it might seem Verhoeven-esque.","91","1706620"
"19646","Under The Skin is rich with menacing atmosphere, so much so that viewers could probably tune out the narrative and still get on the proper wavelength.","91","1441395"
"19647","Jackie is what happens when two distinct sensibilities — the Goliath of the Hollywood prestige pic and the David of Pablo Larraín’s playful, idiosyncratic intelligence — throw down.","91","1619029"
"19648","A buoyant, funny, and disarmingly humane comedy of beautiful losers in revolt.","91","162346"
"19649","What immediately comes to the forefront is that McDonagh has choreographed an almost impossible feat of a brutally dark comedy that, thanks to both Rockwell and McDormand, elicits an emotional response you simply don’t see coming.","91","5027774"
"19650","This is perhaps the only science-fiction film that can be called transcendental.","91","83658"
"19651","Don't go if ""Star Wars"" isn't your bag: You'll only resist and resent it. But if you're a fan, it's hard to see how you'd be disappointed. Me? I can't wait for May 2005. ""Episode III"": Hot diggity!","91","121765"
"19652","The Secret Life of Pets is funnier than Zootopia and fresher than Finding Dory. Bonus points for a genuinely touching finale that had me crying behind my 3-D glasses.","91","2709768"
"19653","There’s a lot going on in Ingmar Bergman’s The Seventh Seal, with its striking imagery, bawdy humor, and grim suffering; it’s a humane film about the inhumane inevitability of death. I’m still not much of a cinephile (this is my second Bergman film, and I only watched The Virgin Spring so I could compare it in an essay to The Last House On The Left), but I’m coming to realize that the difference between a good movie and a great one are those moments of intense personal connection where it seems like the filmmaker is reaching out to you through the screen and whispering (or yelling, or cajoling, or demanding, or pleading) in your ear. As if there is no real distance between you and the director, time has changed nothing, and the moment remains as pure as it was on the day it was filmed.","91","50976"
"19654","A less controlled and slapdash character piece than ""In Bruge,"" McDonagh's new movie benefits greatly from a plethora of one-liners that toy with crime movie clichés in the unlikely context of writerly obsessions.","91","1931533"
"19655","It’s not the kind of film you watch waiting for “the answer.” Saulnier isn’t going to solve the equation for you in Hold The Dark. But he is going to kick your ass.","91","5057140"
"19656","Zuckerberg's story ends up feeling bigger than his own life.","91","1285016"
"19657","Bateman deserves props for sustaining Bad Words as a little balancing act between sulfurously funny hatred and humanity.","91","2170299"
"19658","From the opening shot of a burnt-orange GTO cruising a high school parking lot to the strains of Aerosmith's ''Sweet Emotion,'' Richard Linklater's film nails mid-'70s adolescence so precisely that you'll need Clearasil by the end credits.","91","106677"
"19659","Despite its ruff collars and Elizabethan English, Mary Queen of Scots is no staid, stuffy period drama, as restrained as the breathing of corseted women. Instead, this a vital film, whose lace-trimmed bosom heaves with life.","91","2328900"
"19660","He (LaBute) pulls the farce and the violence and the fantasies together with a deft touch and a sweetness rare in American films -- especially his.","91","171580"
"19661","There aren't many at all like Spielberg and Kubrick, directors willing to lasso dreams (that's Steven) and nightmares (that's Stanley) or die trying. A.I. is a clash of the titans, a jumble, an oedipal drama, a carny act. I want to see it again.","91","212720"
"19662","Which brings us back to Kidman, who really IS sensational here.","91","757361"
"19663","A film with a universal sensitivity that relates the pangs of first love, the desirous ache of adolescent sexuality and the excitement of not just discovering yourself but finding those kindred spirits with whom you can share your life.","91","1233334"
"19664","The impact is hypnotic.","91","408236"
"19665","Has a genial, funky charm.","91","117918"
"19666","It's a sexy thriller, tautly constructed, deeply acted and heartfelt, despite a cool and knowing tone.","91","416320"
"19667","This is a soul-stirring and fiercely uncynical film that suggests the entire world is a living museum for the people we’ve lost, and that we should all hope to leave some of ourselves behind in its infinite cabinet of wonders.","91","5208216"
"19668","The superb character actor Celia Weston (In the Bedroom) is truly breathtaking as Ronnie's boozer mom.","91","1197628"
"19669","A remarkable refashioning of the Holocaust drama that reignites the setting with extraordinary immediacy, Son of Saul is both terrifying to watch and too gripping in its moment-to-moment to look away.","91","3808342"
"19670","As loose and playful as major studio movies get.","91","910936"
"19671","Wilson has a scene near the end with Marley that's the most wrenchingly tender acting of his career.","91","822832"
"19672","The unlikeliest enthralling movie to be released so far this year.","91","169102"
"19673","A happy surprise: a timely antidote to the comic-book mindlessness of ""Spider-Man"" and repetitive space fantasy of ""Star Wars,"" and an encouraging bid from the top of the A-list to once again reach very high and spit in the face of the gutless formula filmmaking that rules Hollywood.","91","181689"
"19674","The film's single downside is a certain nagging sense of deja vu: the fact that so many of the elements of the story -- the dark force, the all-empowering object, etc. -- have been usurped over the years (by ""Star Wars"" and others) that you feel as if you've been down this road many, many times before.","91","120737"
"19675","Many moviegoers may think they already know a good deal about Hawking’s achievements, but they would do themselves a disservice to miss out on Redmayne’s almost perfect performance.","91","2980516"
"19676","This movie provides no phony catharsis or closure; it develops a vision of people growing in spurts from their most terrible mistakes.","91","775529"
"19677","To watch Ryan O’Neal’s performance as the upwardly mobile Barry, part victim and part cad, is to see Kubrick’s perverse genius with actors. He cast a dullard only to jolt us, by the end, with the revelation of the bastard within.","91","72684"
"19678","With its this-is-really-happening vibe, Paranormal Activity scrapes away 30 years of encrusted nightmare clichés. The fear is real, all right, because the fear is really in you.","91","1179904"
"19679","The Planet of the Apes films had always been political, but with Conquest of the Planet of the Apes, things got angry. And it was awesome.","91","68408"
"19680","Like all courtroom dramas, A Few Good Men is gimmicky and synthetic. It's also an irresistible throwback to the sort of sharp-edged entertainment Hollywood once provided with regularity.","91","104257"
"19681","Very much a '70s-style paranoid thriller, with a mood, tone and cascade of plot twists that are highly reminiscent of his 1975 classic, ""Three Days of the Condor.""","91","373926"
"19682","Movies with this serious a message about race are rarely fun to watch, but Peele has a perfect handle on tone, knowing just when to lean toward menacing, eerie or sharply funny and when to tip things in another direction.","91","5052448"
"19683","Though it’s not outright scary, Midsommar will no doubt unsettle even the most steeled of viewers. It will also satiate those who may have feared a sophomore slump from Aster. Hardly. This film’s the real deal, and if anything, it’s more audience-friendly than his first. Don’t miss it.","91","8772262"
"19684","Fukunaga not only directed the film but also co-wrote the screenplay and served as director of photography. His efforts have resulted in a brazenly confident piece of cinematic art where every image immerses you deeper and deeper into Agu’s horror.","91","1365050"
"19685","Nicolas Roeg’s art-house adventure is lyrical and intoxicating.","91","67959"

"19687","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 1 also bravely faces the future, slipping with expert ease among the thrilling mass of complications (and complicated set pieces) that Rowling throws fans in the final sprint, then guiding the faithful to the fate that awaits everyone in this world, the moment called The End.","91","926084"
"19688","Between the tart dialogue, the compelling lead performances, the vivid violence and the stunning cinematography, it's complete and satisfying all on its own.","91","134847"
"19689","The performances are winning, the story is surprising without relying on unlikely twists, and the relationships are the richest and most nuanced since Leigh's ""Secrets & Lies.""","91","1431181"
"19690","It's not art, but it's mighty fun.","91","800369"
"19691","Young Adult bumps along with nasty swerves, middle finger proudly in the air, toward an ending blessedly free of anything warm, fuzzy, or optimistic. Now that's adult entertainment.","91","1625346"

"19694","Even as a kid, I could see that Midnight Cowboy’s true subject isn’t decadence but loneliness...Midnight Cowboy’s peep-show vision of Manhattan lowlife may no longer be shocking, but what is shocking, in 1994, is to see a major studio film linger this lovingly on characters who have nothing to offer the audience but their own lost souls.","91","64665"
"19695","Sheer bliss for Monty Python freaks who either have never seen the anarchistic, absurdist and hilarious trials and tribulations of King Arthur and his knights depicted on the big screen or haven't for more than 20 years. From the Knights who say ""Ni!"" to the killer bunny, the picture stands the test of time. [17 Aug 2001]","91","71853"
"19696","The Help has a saucy, humorous side.","91","1454029"
"19697","This is personal filmmaking taken to such an extremely minute level that at times it can almost feel prurient, like we’re accidentally eavesdropping on things too private for our ears, like we’ve intercepted an embrace sent back through time and not really meant for us at all.","91","6155172"
"19698","There are no clichés here, and Lonergan flawlessly carves out the most sincere moments to reveal a sprawling, deeply affecting odyssey of emotional recovery.","91","4034228"
"19699","The Beguiled is a lurid, sweltering, and sensationally fun potboiler that doesn’t find Coppola leaving her comfort zone so much as redecorating it with a fresh layer of soft-core scuzz.","91","5592248"
"19700","The Irishman is the director’s longest drama, but it never drags. The 200-plus minutes pass in a blur of dark humor and characteristically gripping incident . . . But it’s in the final act, when Scorsese slows things down to a purposeful crawl, that the film accumulates its full power.","91","1302006"
"19701","Alien3 is a grimly seductive end-of-the-world thriller, with pop-tragic overtones that build in resonance as the movie goes on.","91","103644"
"19702","The movie’s conclusion pits religion against personal desire in remarkably visceral terms.","91","6053438"
"19703","Fosse spins his runaway narcissism into self-effacing humor and filters the darkest themes through electrifying song-and-dance numbers. The musical sequences are a lesson in choreography, not just for Fosse's renowned wit and invention in handling his dancers, but also in the editing, which fuses music and movement in perfectly timed cuts.","91","78754"
"19704","Upstream Color is routinely confusing but not oppressively so; its final exquisite moments explain little yet still manage to invite you in.","91","2084989"
"19705","An ode to art for art's sake, Inside Llewyn Davis is the most innocent movie of the Coens' career, which in their case is a downright radical achievement.","91","2042568"
"19706","Sweetness makes the raunch in this honestly funny movie even funnier.","91","1477837"
"19707","Nocturnal Animals is an impressively ambitious effort, one part mean Texas thriller, one part middle-age melodrama, and makes for a meta-textual riddle that is almost as pleasurable to reflect on as it to actually watch.","91","4550098"
"19708","Believe it or not, though, the real horror of this superb Aussie monster movie has almost nothing to do with the title fiend and everything to do with the unspoken, unspeakable impulses he represents. Remove the Babadook from The Babadook, in other words, and something plenty terrifying remains.","91","2321549"
"19709","Her Smell goes beyond the expected trappings of your usual rock drama and successfully manages to capture the convulsive core of musical artistry while suggesting, in a major departure for the usually cynical Alex Ross Perry, that it’s possible for the individual to break free of its corrosive bonds.","91","7942742"
"19710","The Old Man & The Gun is, on the surface, a low-key, easygoing movie that is funny and charming. But it’s also slightly subversive, nodding to the appeal of the great American anti-hero, a role that Redford played many times in his career.","91","2837574"
"19711","Incredibly heartfelt to a large degree because of its cast.","91","1045658"
"19712","An exciting, splattery, funny genre movie that somehow never once feels disposable.","91","4062536"
"19713","With an outstanding screenplay by Brian Koppelman and disciplined direction by Koppelman and David Levien, a story that could have been generic (or worse, scented with flowery bulls---) turns into a precise, honest, and affecting drama.","91","1294213"
"19714","There's a kind of tough beauty to this deft, satisfying thriller.","91","831884"
"19715","Though its procedural goes a little soft in the middle, Gone Baby Gone quietly accumulates in power, leading to one of the more subtly devastating final shots in recent memory.","91","452623"
"19716","Minghella makes an enticing, intelligent, well-shaped picture about the extreme perils of class envy and sexual panic.","91","134119"
"19717","Living in Oblivion celebrates the very act of filmmaking as grand folly, a triumph of absurdist heroism.","91","113677"
"19718","In a masterful performance, Langella highlights Nixon's oily charm and guile.","91","870111"
"19719","While not designed to entertain on the level of style and spectacle that one expects from a Bond film, this tense period drama from the director of ""Man on Wire"" presents a far more credible take on the daring exploits of British agents.","91","1770734"
"19720","It’s an enthusiastic, hilarious reboot of the idea of what a Marvel movie can actually be, resulting in an effervescent, delightfully self-aware ride that was the most fun I’d had in a superhero movie in years.","91","3501632"
"19721","Precious can’t be endorsed as entertainment: the circumstances and incidents and emotions in the film are far too dark and painful. But there is exhilaration in its daring, in its craft and in the powerhouse work of its principal actresses.","91","929632"
"19722","The film is like East of Eden replayed as a hyperbolic rock fever dream. There are a few sour, juvenile moments, but this is the rare pop movie that works the way a great rock & roll song does: It tells a simple, almost elemental tale and uses the music to set it aflame.","91","87957"
"19723","For all its moodiness, despair and disconnect, I've Loved You So Long is all about acknowledging human error and embracing ties -- to family and life -- that can't be undone.","91","1068649"
"19724","Johnson keeps it simple, yet never stupid. Looper is a puzzle engaging your brain, rather than frying it, as one character describes the process. Obviously he has seen enough movies on the subject by 2024 to know how frustrating that is. This one plays fair with the fantasy.","91","1276104"
"19725","Pull back from the moment-to-moment thrill of Inside Out and it gets very deep: The scenario implicitly questions standard definitions of free will by suggesting that we're all slaves to ghosts in the machine.","91","2096673"
"19726","It's a refreshing change from run-of-the-kill horror. Nothing in Splice feels done merely for the moment -- it's to creep you out later.","91","1017460"
"19727","In the world of comic-book movies, American Splendor is the real deal, the warts-and-all adventures of the most unlikely hero on the comic stands.","91","305206"
"19728","Phantom may not be the best entry in the series, but it's the most technically accomplished, and it makes you as hungry for the next film as you've been for this one.","91","120915"
"19729","Mathieu Amalric, best known as an arms dealer in ""Munich."" In a role that strips him entirely of vanity and denies him virtually every expressive tool, Amalric makes a genuinely touching impression.","91","401383"
"19730","An attack-of-the-aliens disaster film crafted with sinister technological grandeur -- a true popcorn apocalypse.","91","407304"
"19731","The jazzish score, by Lee's music man, Terence Blanchard, is typically intrusive. But the mood is right, the twists are new. And with one casting inspiration, Inside Man furthers the rising stardom of Chiwetel Ejiofor (Serenity).","91","454848"
"19732","Adventuresome, melancholy and exhilarating.","91","338013"
"19733","What’s perhaps most remarkable about Mudbound is its emotional honesty, Rees rarely sidestepping the inner lives of her characters and never diminishing their own battles to live in an unlivable time, however wrongheaded they might be.","91","2396589"
"19734","A paragon of subtlety. Yet this message is exactly what we carry out of the theater, and it lingers on with a powerful resonance.","91","433383"
"19735","It isn't particularly original--for one, it owes an unacknowledged debt to the French film ""Them""--but as an exercise in controlled mayhem, horror movies don't get much scarier.","91","482606"
"19736","Building to the potential of a confrontation with the wedding climax, The Farewell threatens to melt into sentimentalism, but Wang dodges the obvious pathways to a tidy resolution.","91","8637428"
"19737","Flat-out one of the best Bonds ever.","91","381061"
"19738","The movie lives and dies, however, on Ingrid herself and, remarkably, Plaza finds a way for you to root for her even when she crosses line after line after line.","91","5962210"
"19739","In a time when even the best of big Hollywood movies all seem to be mired in a certain nagging, unimaginative visual sameness, this one dares to take us to a place we haven't been before.","91","120824"
"19740","Ready to Wear is a comedy - one of Altman's funniest - but it's the humor of humiliation, of the characters and the industry. [23 Dec 1994, p.16]","91","110907"
"19741","It's no wonder that Polanski, himself an artist who has survived a series of nightmares, should tell it so naturally and powerfully.","91","253474"
"19742","Snappy patter reigns again, but by letting the story develop in open spaces rather than through tight edits, Bogdanovich fosters an atmosphere of freedom and promise.","91","70510"
"19743","The charming movie, already an international success, seduces.","91","211915"
"19744","With its sweet soul and sharp mind, it's one of the most heartening films of the year.","91","119217"
"19745","As a man flummoxed by circumstance and the rifts in his own marriage, Romano is deeply touching in the role. As for Hunter, this is her best work since “Broadcast News.”","91","5462602"
"19746","Despite its haphazard rhythms and longueurs, The New World achieves an emotional payoff unlike anything else in Malick's work. It's all you think his movies are, and more.","91","402399"
"19747","In The Loop floats above its chaotic world on wave after wave of beautifully profane dialogue.","91","1226774"
"19748","Brashly engaging.","91","116695"
"19749","Halloween is a love letter to the original picture and entertaining on its own terms. Thrilling, atmospheric, and brutally violent, Green delivers exactly what fans want from the series and then some.","91","1502407"
"19750","It isn't in the same league as the director's best work, chiefly because it lacks the bravura flourishes of cinematic craft that helped make his name. But it's so vital and bloody and funny and wicked and tense and unapologetic that it feels kin to those films, which little of the director's work of the past decade has managed to pull off.","91","407887"
"19751","How many times have you read that it’s really hard to duplicate the success of the first film in a sequel? Probably more than you can remember. Well, here’s a newsflash: Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2 pulls that feat off with only a little strain and a belly of genuine emotion.","91","3896198"
"19752","The violence is shocking, effective and soaked into the dry brown landscape.","91","3397884"
"19753","The film captures how the constant turnover of students keeps educators poised between loss and rebirth, fuddy-duddyism and eternal kiddishness. That balance is there, most pleasurably, in Dreyfuss’ performance. The wonders of makeup and hairpieces have taken 20 years off his age, and his acting feels 20 years younger, too. He has an edgy vigor here that recalls his ebullient star turns of the late ’70s.","91","113862"
"19754","You could describe Margin Call as a thriller (it's wired with suspense), yet the tension all comes from words.","91","1615147"
"19755","Farhadi's new movie confirms his unique ability to explore how constant chatter and anguished outbursts obscure the capacity for honest communication.","91","2404461"
"19756","Deliverance is a film about finding the place where ideas mean less than instinct.","91","68473"
"19757","There's a good chance that Judge's smartly lowbrow Idiocracy will be mistaken for what it's satirizing, but good satire always runs the risk -- of being misunderestimated.","91","387808"
"19758","John Wick, is not only a return to badass form for the actor, it's also one of the most excitingly visceral action flicks I've seen in ages.","91","2911666"
"19759","Dark and giddy at the same time, Leaving Las Vegas takes us into dreamy, intoxicated places that no movie about an alcoholic has gone before.","91","113627"
"19760","Unlike Cox’s sneering Sid and Nancy, it’s defined more by a tone of affectionate disaffection than antipathy, celebrating a friendlier species of anarchy.","91","87995"
"19761","If you scratch the surface, Buster Scruggs gets to the root of what the Coen Brothers’ work is about, and what it’s always been about.","91","6412452"
"19762","Funny, ungirdled romp - a buddy picture about buddies who actually know what women want.","91","396269"
"19763","American Hustle turns out to be a freewheeling party of a movie, one that never stops adding complications and wrinkles and hungry new players to the mix.","91","1800241"
"19764","As Hawks admits, Bringing Up Baby isn’t a perfect film. But there’s an undeniable, ephemeral magic that comes from watching him, Hepburn, and Grant all work together on such a madcap story.","91","29947"
"19765","Arrival, the shimmering apex of Villeneuve’s run of form that started back in 2010 with “Incendies,” calmly, unfussily and with superb craft, thinks its way out of the black hole that tends to open up when ideas like time travel, alien contact and the next phase of human evolution are bandied about.","91","2543164"
"19766","No, it doesn't exactly re-create the magic that made the original such an instant classic, but it's faster and more involving than ""Reloaded"" and it rounds off the premise and themes of the trilogy in a surprisingly satisfying way.","91","242653"
"19767","It’s easily the most enjoyable animated film so far this year, one that is visually stunning, wickedly subversive, incredibly funny (Day's character is a hoot), and (at times) lump-in-your-throat emotional.","91","1453405"
"19768","It wouldn’t be surprising to hear about moviegoers demanding their money back after seeing The Dallas Buyers Club, but not because the film isn’t good. It’s actually very nearly great.","91","790636"
"19769","In Please Give, the sharp-eyed filmmaker sends her vibrant representative out into the world to explore what it means for a woman to be lucky and still feel itchy. The report has the resonant ring of truth.","91","878835"
"19770","The Queen is all-together remarkable not only for what it is but for what it isn't.","91","436697"
"19771","[Taylor] deftly translates the bleak, raw-boned menace and tricky time signatures of Train’s intertwined plotlines, and draws remarkably vivid performances from his cast, particularly his two female leads.","91","3631112"
"19772","It's Cronenberg's most mainstream work, and yet it has all the power of his creepiest nightmares.","91","399146"
"19773","The Boxtrolls charms, in every way it can – with its gorgeous animation style that combines lo-fi with high-tech (the puppets were printed using 3D printers), with the huggable nature of the characters, and with the boldness of its storytelling and thematic concerns.","91","787474"
"19774","This movie doesn't end up taking on all the problems it offers up. Meting out justice to an evil school administrator seems to be enough for now. As an enlightened and energetic film - a voice for the '90s - it is enough. [12 Sep 1990, p.11]","91","100436"
"19775","22 July is a thoughtful, gutting achievement that you’ll likely never want to watch again. Greengrass’ approach here is graceful and deeply resonant, but it’s undoubtedly draining, especially considering you still have roughly two hours to go after the shootings that ignite the narrative","91","7280898"
"19776","Exhilarating drama, and a triumphant return to glory for both Zemeckis and Washington.","91","1907668"
"19777","It's a beautiful contraption of a movie, a gothic backwoods fable that uses its naive yet murderous hero to walk a fine line between sentimentality and dread.","91","117666"
"19778","High school reunions should only be this satisfying.","91","119229"
"19779","The Other Side of the Wind is not a comeback picture in the sense Touch of Evil was supposed to be. It is a confounding, unsettling, disorienting adieu from a director whose nonconformist and uncompromising vision was decades ahead of his time.","91","69049"
"19780","Baumbach has cast a wonderfully talented group of up-and-coming actors around Gerwig and Kirke, but it's the screenplay and the leads' incredible chemistry that makes it all so entertaining. There are so many one-liners that you miss because the previous line of dialogue is just as smart and laugh-inducing.","91","2872462"
"19781","Being There finds humor in the way Sellers becomes a blank screen on which people project their expectations. But it also finds value in his simplicity, which might seem like a lot of New Age hokum if not for Sellers' disarmingly quiet performance.","91","78841"
"19782","Campion's big-sisterly encouragement of Cornish's lovely, openhearted performance -- and Whishaw's well-matched response -- results in a character instantly, intimately recognizable to anyone remembering her own first love.","91","810784"
"19783","The director’s most ambitious work to date is a wildly successful romantic heist comedy, propelled from scene to scene with a lively soundtrack that elevates its slick chase scenes into a realm of musicality that develops its own satisfying beat.","91","3890160"
"19784","The cast is good, the score is sublime, the visuals are sumptuous and it speeds along with a delirious romantic power that, if you let it, can sweep you away.","91","293508"
"19785","A brilliant home-invasion thriller laced with cultural reference points stretching back to the late ’80s, and a smorgasbord of first-rate visceral cinematic scares. Think “Funny Games” collided with Cronenbergian body horror and Hitchockian suspense, and you’re maybe halfway there.","91","6857112"
"19786","At its best, Juno is about the messy things in life that are not so easily summarized.","91","467406"
"19787","Submarine is the film ""Youth In Revolt"" should have been, an achingly sad yet ribald account of a hyper-verbal oddball's ascent/descent into manhood.","91","1440292"
"19788","This is a beautifully built, classically framed movie, shot with the unshowy natural expressiveness of a John Ford Western by Spielberg's great cinematographer, Janusz Kaminski.","91","1568911"
"19789","If Beale Street Could Talk stalls about halfway through with less involving developments and stilted roles for supporting characters...but it always regains its footing with another entrancing observation.","91","7125860"
"19790","The darkest, most operatic, and technologically richest ""Star Wars"" movie to date, ""Sith"" is grim, stirring entertainment and a nearly complete vindication of everything its creator has been saying for six years about where the series was heading and what its final shape would be.","91","121766"
"19791","In a feat of performing imagination, Ferrell turns his usual extroversion inside out and his usual zaniness into precision, and makes it all work for him.","91","420223"
"19792","Redford proves that at 75 he can still choose meaningful projects and deliver them with intelligence.","91","968264"
"19793","Sometimes a movie’s turmoil isn’t a sign of impending doom so much as one of impending brilliance.","91","84805"
"19794","The Nice Guys, which the screenwriter also directed, is the best of Black’s films. It is eccentrically, sometimes broadly funny, with top-notch performances from Crowe and Gosling and a pitch-perfect sense of timing to help smooth over some of the script’s fault lines and blind spots.","91","3799694"
"19795","The rousing new Western 3:10 to Yuma has the sweep of an epic and the economy of a stopwatch.","91","381849"
"19796","The pressure cooker atmosphere builds for almost too long, but when the resolution finally occurs, the sense of relief is that much more palpable.","91","1535109"
"19797","The A-Team is literally a blast, from the opening credits containing more thrills than the average shoot-'em-up (and more laughs than some comedies), to a climactic orgy of CGI destruction.","91","429493"
"19798","You will be heartened by the amazing sensation of watching one of the greatest works in the history of the medium unfold in front of you, piece by piece, year by year.","91","167261"
"19799","Spike Jonze has recently said in interviews that his chief goal ...was to try to capture the feeling of being 9. By that measure--by just about any measure, really--he succeeded wildly.","91","386117"
"19800","The Descendants constantly hovers on the brink of a dark comedy. But it never takes the big plug. By treading carefully, Payne has created his warmest, most earnest work, if not his best.","91","1033575"
"19801","Kazan has fun with a silly premise and smartly plays it straight when the occasion calls for it, while keeping the cutesy, fantastical extremes of the material at bay. It's less fairy tale than shrewd exaggeration on the pratfalls of desire.","91","1839492"
"19802","The Fugitive is hardly Hitchcock — it never taps our emotions in a way that threatens to transcend the action — but it’s a mainstream thriller made with conviction, intelligence, and heat. In Hollywood, that used to be called professionalism. These days, it’s rare enough to look like artistry.","91","106977"
"19803","Its got a deliciously audacious and cheeky tenor.","91","1130080"
"19804","Tarantino simply isn't a good enough performer for his presence to be anything but a distraction in a rip-roaring crowd-pleaser this consistently great.","91","1853728"
"19805","It's the most charming and buoyant film Spielberg's ever made.","91","264464"
"19806","The London universe Leigh creates (employing his trademark improv techniques to unite his ensemble, many of whom make their film debuts) isn't so much a reality as a hope, and an invitation to find joy and grace in everyday moments.","91","1045670"
"19807","It might just be the most poignant, moving film ever made about one man's surprisingly noble efforts to get laid.","91","1866249"
"19808","The Red Turtle nevertheless remains throughout a simple, gripping story of survival, deriving its sense of adventure from the most basic plot imaginable: Here’s a human being, stranded in a strange place, using his strength, intelligence, and courage to forge some kind of a life for himself.","91","3666024"
"19809","If the sequels to “The Force Awakens” are as good as this film, that will probably be because they follow the same formula: heavy on the human side, more comedy, less CGI, more fresh faces, and more delightful droids. And, yes, one must pay homage to the Force.","91","2488496"
"19810","The film has visual and verbal flair, spry energy and deep wit.","91","1540133"
"19811","Few would argue that Oldman isn’t one of the finest actors of his generation, but this is a tour de force portrayal that will define his body of work for decades to come.","91","4555426"
"19812","The film doesn't turn its issues into a glorified essay, but it does use them to give the audience a vital emotional workout.","91","1764183"
"19813","Bouncing giddily from subplot to subplot and wisecrack to wisecrack, Mamet and company (and this is one of the truest ensemble works in years) satirize the slippery morals of the film racket and the surface-only decency of small town America.","91","120202"
"19814","The movie darts, dreams, and sometimes seems to dance. The great Plummer, meanwhile, creates an inspiring, fully rounded man in late bloom, and McGregor responds with a performance to match.","91","1532503"
"19815","Spiritual redemption is a big theme of Narnia, but on a purely entertainment level, the movie also goes a long way in redeeming the current sad state of children's fantasy filmmaking.","91","363771"
"19816","Hilarious. And more proof that Pixar is in a class of its own.","91","382932"
"19817","Both introspective and entertaining, Betts never forgets that her young nuns are still teenage girls, and Novitiate rings as true as any other film about coming of age.","91","4513316"
"19818","[Coogler] infuses nearly every frame with soul and style, and makes the radical case that a comic-book movie can actually have something meaningful — beyond boom or kapow or America — to say. In that context, Panther’s nuanced celebration of pride and identity and personal responsibility doesn’t just feel like a fresh direction for the genre, it’s the movie’s own true superpower.","91","1825683"
"19819","Bitterly funny about divorce, it's even sharper and more original about intellectuals and their discontent.","91","367089"
"19820","Easily the best in the series since the first one.","91","337978"
"19821","Nobody fires a shot. Nobody topples a kingdom. But as Ivan Locke’s life unravels behind the wheel of his car, which he drives almost from the first frame to the last, we can’t look away.","91","2692904"
"19822","The movie was a major success for Melanie Griffith, sure, but it was as the secretary's boss ... that Weaver combined all of her star qualities, pulled in laughs, and took home an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress.","91","96463"
"19823","Crowe, staying close to his memories, has gotten it, for perhaps the first time, onto the screen.","91","181875"
"19824","If you think the ""Star Wars"" prequels are a disease, then Serenity is the cure.","91","379786"
"19825","Though at times almost too peculiar for its own good, The Lobster brings Lanthimos' distinct blend of morbid, deadpan humor and surrealism to a broader canvas without compromising his ability to deliver another thematically rich provocation.","91","3464902"
"19826","Feels as true as a documentary, as painful as a blow to the heart.","91","120586"
"19827","With humor that cuts through a deep undercurrent of sadness, Baker Boys captures the rinky-dink milieu of second-rate lounges, where patron kibitzing threatens to drown out the piano-tinkling of the paid entertainment.","91","97322"
"19828","For all its touchy subjects and ambiguous answers, “Hustlers” is never anything less than energetic, freight-train-fast, and impeccably plotted.","91","5503686"
"19829","The results are being billed as a reunion of the ""Titanic"" star team, but anyone expecting a similarly gushy romantic idyll is in for a shock: it is an uncompromisingly dreary view of two self-deluded people incapable and unwilling to understand one another.","91","959337"
"19830","Using New York’s famed apartment house the Dakota for all its cavernous shadowiness, and exploiting the 23-year-old Farrow’s tremulous space-child vulnerability to underscore her terror and solitude, Polanski worked with an elegant restraint that less talented filmmakers have been trying to mimic ever since.","91","63522"
"19831","A fast, loose, and very funny parody that pulls off the not-so-simple feat of tweaking Trekkies and honoring them.","91","177789"
"19832","For a while, the girls' personalities seem almost interchangeable, but that's part of the texture. Katie Chang gives the leader a ripe synthetic glow, and Emma Watson does a remarkable job of demonstrating that glassy-eyed insensitivity need not be stupid.","91","2132285"
"19833","A charmer of a film and a delightful piece of storytelling.","91","910970"
"19834","Yet another celebrity-voiced animal adventure, but it stands out from the crowd of similar films with its lightning wit and whirlwind brio.","91","441773"
"19835","The best comedy of its kind since ""Superbad,"" Wilde’s slick, unpredictable romp can sometimes feel like several movies at once. This riotous, candy-colored celebration of sisterhood is so dense with anarchic developments it often threatens to collapse into itself, but avoids lingering on any gag long enough to let that happen.","91","1489887"
"19836","Bean's commitment to serious theological examination is exciting, Gosling's performance is riveting, and this fiery and imperfect feature shines as a demonstration of independent filmmaking at its most uncompromising.","91","247199"
"19837","Lady Bird is both snarky and sincere — a touching, markedly feminine ode to growing up that never takes its familiarity for granted. Gerwig earns the ability to make this rite-of-passage saga her own.","91","4925292"
"19838","It’s a fascinating story about ambition and vanity and pride, and in Sheen’s performance and the atmosphere capture by Hooper it contains truly fine and rare things.","91","1226271"
"19839","Grant is the rare actor who can mix the characteristics of sex appeal and ambivalence in believable, rather than irritating, proportions.","91","109831"
"19840","I Think We’re Alone Now is an exercise in ambiance, and Morano is nothing if not a brilliant conductor of tone. Favoring dreamy over dreary, the movie is a handsome and often mesmerizing addition to Morano’s expanding oeuvre.","91","6169694"
"19841","A fun, albeit unspectacular, animated movie, filled with Disney staples like cute animal characters, a scenery-chewing villainess, and a small-nosed pixie heroine who yearns to travel to distant lands and marry a large-nosed hunk prince.","91","97757"
"19842","This is the loopiest star vehicle in ages.","91","887883"
"19843","As a flight of fantasy, Jurassic Park lacks the emotional unity of Spielberg's classics (""Jaws,"" ""Close Encounters,"" ""E.T.""), yet it has enough of his innocent, playful virtuosity to send you out of the theater grinning with delight.","91","107290"
"19844","Gerwig’s adaptation looks at the eponymous little women through ambitious storytelling techniques that modernize the book’s timeless story in unexpected ways.","91","3281548"
"19845","It's first-rank filmmaking, through and through, even if it struggles to find closure.","91","469494"
"19846","All you could hope for from a summer movie: dazzling action, jaw-dropping effects, cool clothes, steamy romance and more of the nifty ""Matrix"" mythology introduced in the 1999 original.","91","234215"
"19847","It's a terrific movie -- intelligent, magnificently acted, highly compelling as a thriller, and downright scary in its implications for the corporate-run world of the new millennium.","91","140352"
"19848","It puts human faces on the victims of mass destruction, faces that might easily have been yours or mine, staring down the maw of something we don't understand.","91","1060277"
"19849","For long stretches, the film is just as funny as the first -- which is saying something, since the first is one of the funniest comedies of the decade, the only film in years to truly infiltrate our communal language and sense of humor.","91","145660"
"19850","Much like The Witch, there is something quite mesmerizing about the meticulousness in the period detail here and how Eggers so seems to revel in it.","91","7984734"
"19851","In Almodóvar and Cruz we have a real collaboration of artist and inspiration that only seems to improve and deepen over time.","91","913425"
"19852","Brimming with wit, crushing last-act melancholia, laughs, and poignant heart, Me And Earl And The Dying Girl is a spectacular delivery of tears, love and laughter, and a beautifully charming, captivating knock-out.","91","2582496"
"19853","Cronenberg has, as Guillermo del Toro did in ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" crafted both a drama and a fairy tale -- and he's done it in an entertainment as cracking as you could wish for.","91","765443"
"19854","A Big Sleep with underage bozos, a Maltese Falcon where the stuff that dreams are made of rests in the lockers of a well-worn high school, Brick is a remarkable oddity, audacious and engaging.","91","393109"
"19855","If not for Sareum’s charismatic performance the film might fold like a house of cards.","91","4882376"
"19856","A story in full billow; it sails through stretches of bloody battle, anxious waiting, wine-soaked relaxation, and marvelous scientific discoveries by the remarkable Maturin (Paul Bettany, well matched again with his ''A Beautiful Mind'' costar).","91","311113"
"19857","When it's funny, it's hilarious; when it's serious, it's powerful; and either way, it's an endless pleasant surprise.","91","780536"
"19858","The power to provoke may not always have a smoke-to-fire relationship with greatness but with Scorsese's film, a testament of faith that leaves in the question marks, it undeniably does.","91","95497"
"19859","A nasty little tube of frozen horror concentrate.","91","435625"
"19860","From Russia With Love has two of the sexiest images I’ve ever seen: the opening credits with the names projected on belly dancers’ writhing, whirling bodies, and the scene where a bare-chested, towel-clad Bond enters his bedroom and finds Tatiana Romanova in his bed. Images like that aren’t cute. They’re primordial.","91","57076"
"19861","The supersmart and rousing Moneyball, which may be the best baseball movie since ""Bull Durham,"" is also about talk, but in a coolly heady and original inside-the-front-office way.","91","1210166"
"19862","The reason the film works is because it throws everything into the blender and comes up with something new, something that has a great lively sense of wit and humor to it, and it takes the time to fully explore its wild premise fully.","91","1631867"
"19863","Rivets our interest for its entire lengthy running time. And it does this without any of the usual war movie clichés, false heroics, barracks-humor nonsense or grandstanding absurdities.","91","265086"
"19864","Showcases Jones' ability to provide ample entertainment value with sharply drawn characters in a minimalist setting.","91","945513"
"19865","A rich, dark, pulpy mess of entanglements that fulfills all the requirements of the genre, and is told with an ease and gusto that make the pulp tasty.","91","840361"
"19866","It’s incredibly thrilling to watch, impressively emotional throughout, and easily the best Spider-Man movie since “Spider-Man 2.”","92","4633694"
"19867","Wild Tales represents the work of an exceedingly skillful storyteller.","92","3011894"
"19868","Inventively, Gilroy utilizes exaggerated horror tropes to take to task our cynical thoughts about artistic creation. His sharp Velvet Buzzsaw is an exquisitely diabolical exposé on the merciless materialistic ambitions that run rampant in cultural fields.","92","7043012"
"19869","The film more than earns its commanding title: You will not want to look away.","92","5311542"
"19870","This is a film about pain, and it forces the audience to live in and work through that pain. And it’s absolutely worth the effort. By the end it’s a transformative experience.","92","5742374"
"19871","The film is one of the most meditative of Almodóvar’s career. ... It makes for less energetic and, yes, less exciting filmmaking. But “Pain and Glory” is a beautiful meditation on past and present, a memory piece that will nourish rather than provoke.","92","8291806"
"19872","IT may not be the best Stephen King movie (even though it comes impressively close), but it’s probably the MOST Stephen King movie.","92","1396484"
"19873","Only Lovers Left Alive is an exhibit A example of how to use style to enhance substance, not overwhelm it.","92","1714915"
"19874","By inhabiting the worst periods of his life, LaBeouf delivers one of the best performances of the year.","92","8151874"
"19875","With The Birth of a Nation, Nate Parker has shown himself to be a confident, extraordinary filmmaker. He not only gets good performances from his cast, but has created a film that seems sure of itself, one that knows when to lean into depicting hatred, when to lean into depicting love, and when to cut away; when the look on a face is more important than the blood on a back and when it isn't.","92","4196450"
"19876","Ronan’s fiery Mary and Robbie’s emotionally complex Elizabeth truly reign divine on screen.","92","2328900"
"19877","Fast and funny, filled with memorable characters, and able to balance slapstick and violence without spilling too far in either direction, this frenetic R-rated farce is that rare comic gem that lands on all the spaces without ever going to jail.","92","2704998"
"19878","Like so much of Key & Peele’s comedy, Get Out is refreshing in its naked, frank aggression about confronting racial issues, with comedy, drama, and sharp, unsparing insight.","92","5052448"
"19879","Alfonso Cuarón has created a heartfelt masterpiece of mood and nostalgia, one that reminds us that his gifts as a storyteller and an interpreter of the human experience are not dictated by scale of production.","92","6155172"
"19880","The master filmmaker has made an introspective, thoughtful, even somber film that manages to be just as entertaining as his classics, even while diving deep into the darkest souls and finding some semblance of a heart.","92","1302006"
"19881","Land of Mine is a powerful epic, superbly acted, tense and unsettling, but also poignant and occasionally tender.","92","3841424"
"19882","Lady Bird is nothing short of tremendous, a wise film about how two people deal with ambivalence.","92","4925292"
"19883","Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is a raucous, smart, self-referential adventure. The comics-inspired visuals are stunning, and the emotional coming-of-age story is relevant and inspiring, even as it acknowledges the many Spider-Man movies that have come before it.","93","4633694"
"19884","Aside from exploring the housing crisis benefiting developers and startups, “Last Black Man” hones in on male friendship from the standpoint of two young guys whose fraternal bond surpasses any need for the posturing associated with toxic masculinity.","93","4353250"
"19885","Top to bottom, Frozen is a delight. The writing is witty, the voicing is excellent, the story is nuanced and the songs are some of the best since Beauty and the Beast. It's a throwback to a wondrous time in Disney animation, and just a ton of fun.","93","2294629"
"19886","Hereditary is one of the scariest movies around, and a spectacular showcase for actors Toni Collette and Alex Wolff. The film’s subtle shocks and realistic drama combine to create a dreamlike atmosphere, drenched in psychological horror, which builds and builds to a climax that you won’t forget anytime soon.","93","7784604"
"19887","The Disaster Artist is a hilarious and heart-wrenching ode to outsider art, with a baffling story that would be impossible to believe if it weren’t apparently true. James Franco directs the film with sensitivity and painstaking detail, and gives a fantastic performance as one of the worst filmmakers - and one of the most unusual human beings - ever.","93","3521126"
"19888","A tragic romance of identity embedded in a voluptuous atmosphere, Moonlight flirts with visual and thematic excess. But the emotional integrity of its characters, seamlessly maintained from one set of actors to the next, who so desperately want to love, pulls it back from the brink.","93","4975722"
"19889","Bird's movie neither panders to children nor sneers at them, and it beautifully, lucidly captures the giddy adventurousness of childhood.","93","129167"
"19890","Steven Spielberg tells an intimate story through extravagant storytelling, giving audiences an intensely relevant historical drama, and giving Meryl Streep one of her most nuanced roles in years.","93","6294822"
"19891","Frenetic, anxious and visually stunning, the cinematography of Waves invites us to wade into this world, never warning us there’s still a chance we could drown.","93","8652728"
"19892","Fiercely intelligent and deeply suspenseful, Roman J. Israel, Esq. is an absorbing morality tale from writer/director Dan Gilroy, and boasts one of Denzel Washington’s finest performances.","93","6000478"
"19893","Comic book fans know the thrill of following all your favorite characters through a multi-issue storyline that culminates in a “universe at stake” ending. Now, thanks to 21 movies in 11 years and one massive, satisfying three-hour finale, moviegoers do, too.","93","4154796"
"19894","It’s Hawkins’s wordless performance that holds the movie together and grounds its wilder fancies in a semblance of emotional reality. By turns gentle and curious, vulnerable and fearless, she provides the film with a heroine whose humanity is profoundly irresistible—no matter what your species.","94","5580390"
"19895","Traffic is a riveting, semi-documentary drama, and yet calling it that is a disservice to just how suspenseful and stylish an entertainment it is.","94","181865"
"19896","Far from taking the comfortable approach as yet another cautionary sci-fi tale of technology run amok, Her isn’t interested in holding a dystopic mirror up to society. Jonze instead posits a wonderfully original alternative to Skynet and the Matrix—in the future, the first self-aware A.I. won’t destroy the world, but it may just break your heart.","94","1798709"
"19897","Baumbach takes the time to make room for their opposing viewpoints and experiences, and he creates a richer film for it. Marriage Story is beautifully bittersweet. There are no winners or losers in Charlie and Nicole’s separation, and no heroes or villains, either.","94","7653254"
"19898","The fact that Cuarón’s film strives to be something more than thoroughly harrowing — no small feat in and of itself — solidifies its existence as a marvel of not just technical craft but sheer imagination as well","94","1454468"
"19899","The Peanut Butter Falcon is charming, enveloping, and an absolute joy.","94","4364194"
"19900","Exceptional performances, an unbelievable story, and a soundtrack for the ages make for a viewing experience worth revisiting again and again.","94","5503686"
"19901","There’s something here for lovers of all kinds of movies — even silents and musicals — but the director transcends mere pastiche to craft a work that feels like the product of our collective film-going subconscious.","95","5580390"
"19902","The movie's intricacy, and the way it finds its way into the emotional lives of its characters via (and not in spite of) that intricacy, is what makes it extraordinary. Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy challenges audiences to believe in craftsmanship again.","95","1340800"
"19903","Spotlight is that rare journalistic procedural that deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as “All the President’s Men,” and while the movie never glamorizes or makes saints of its hard-working newsgatherers, it does stand as a reminder of the power and importance of a free press, particularly in ferreting out local corruption and malfeasance.","95","1895587"
"19904","Both haunting and sweeping, Carol represents another masterwork from one of this generation’s great filmmakers.","95","2402927"
"19905","Toni Erdmann is a thoroughly confident and impeccably executed comedy of oddball family functionality.","95","4048272"
"19906","More universal than it is alternative, except in one sense: There's nothing else on the contemporary movie landscape like it.","95","842926"
"19907","Each of her previous movies captures human collapse in slow motion. You Were Never Really Here is a breakdown shot in hyperdrive, lean, economic, utterly ruthless and made with fiery craftsmanship. Let this be the language we use to characterize her reputation as one of the best filmmakers working today.","95","5742374"
"19908","1917 is an expertly crafted and emotionally exhausting thrill-ride behind enemy lines. Gloriously shot, deftly paced, and striking in its gruesome recreation of the time and place, Sam Mendes’ 1917 wisely never loses sight of the smaller, intimate elements in a fast-paced story with immense scale and action.","95","8579674"
"19909","Fun, action-packed and dramatically deep, How to Train Your Dragon 2 is a prime example of ""How to Make a Sequel.""","95","1646971"
"19910","McCarthy has found the right creative partner in Heller, who treads unchartered territory with a character like Israel: unfashionable, unfamiliar and unappealing to most viewers.","95","4595882"
"19911","It’s assuredly directed with a consistent visual tone, and the cast is absolutely dynamite, especially Samberg and Milioti, who have never been better.","95","9484998"
"19912","One of Spike Lee’s best movies. With a dynamite cast, sharp script and pointed humor that underscores real-life, disturbing horrors, it’s an entertaining crime drama that amuses and shocks and invites the audience into a complex and impassioned conversation about the power of racism - and the moving image - to influence our lives.","95","7349662"
"19913","It’s a heartbreaking tale of why the haves and have-nots will stay that way, crafted by a virtuoso director at the very top of his game.","95","6751668"
"19914","Custody embodies Legrand’s attention to detail, reverence for gripping storytelling, command of tension and, above all, direction of finely etched performances for characters major and minor. It is simmering entertainment that amounts to required viewing.","95","6002232"
"19915","It is undeniably effective in setting mood and tone, and it’s the kind of film that will leave audiences talking no matter what they think of it. If the sole purpose of art is to create an emotional response, Mother! is a masterpiece.","95","5109784"
"19916","The real relationship here is between a Batman in existential crisis and a Joker who'd love to leap with him into the abyss -- tight-a--ed yin and anarchist yang in a fantasy franchise that Nolan has made as riveting for its psychological heft as for the adrenaline rushes it inspires at regular intervals.","95","468569"
"19917","Boy Erased is a poignant family drama that explores the importance of unconditional love and acceptance of oneself and each other. Edgerton solidifies his triple-threat status, artfully and intelligently crafting a film that resonates with viewers and facilitates much-needed conversation during these trying times.","95","7008872"
"19918","Dunkirk is a monumental, unconventional, and frequently stunning war movie.","95","5013056"
"19919","It proudly exists on a visceral, sub-verbal level; that’s part of the magic of it. It’s a movie that’s easy to spoil and hard to describe, where mystery is most of the point and interpretation tends to cheapen. Which is to say: just go see it.","95","2798920"
"19920","The Sisters Brothers gallops on screen with a lot of ambitions, and it fulfills them all. It’s a sprawling Western that’s also an intimate character piece; it has moments of wit but also devastating tragedy; it delves into larger themes like the impact of fathers upon sons, and how greed and industrialization lead to environmental devastation, and yet it offers the hope of redemption.","95","4971344"
"19921","Honey Boy crystallizes everything Shia Labeouf’s performance art persona from 2009 until now seemed to be trying to say: that authenticity and authorship are dull considerations compared to insight and emotional truth.","95","8151874"
"19922","It’s a humanist film; it’s about people, and it’s got a pulse. It presents characters as idiosyncratic, domineering, but mostly fearful — timid creatures ambling through life in the hopes of finding refuge.","95","4975722"
"19923","There’s not a wasted moment as The Post packs what could be an overwhelming amount of information into a story that ultimately reveals itself as a Capra-esque morality play with deep roots in recent history and a style that sometimes calls back to the paranoid thrillers of the 1970s.","95","6294822"
"19924","Waititi infuses a level of humanity into WWII without blindly forgiving those responsible, nor hiding behind the guise of good guys in bad situations, or allowing even a 10-year-old boy to get away with hate without swift retribution and thorough self-examination.","95","2584384"
"19925","Zhao clearly understands that universal conflict between desire and reality, and with The Rider, she’s dramatized it beautifully.","95","6217608"
"19926","Mirren, as ever, is both polite and brusque, her petite va-va-voomness never undermining her credibility as a tough military top-ranker. And Rickman — oh, that dryly sarcastic voice.","95","2057392"
"19927","Drive not only met my hopes; it charged way over the speed limit, partly because it's an unapologetically commercial picture that defies all the current trends in mainstream action filmmaking.","95","780504"
"19928","An elegantly stitched romance of vector-crossing emotional neediness, it’s set in an evocative ecosphere of haute couture fashion. But by the time it reaches its appetizingly perverse end, the film primarily reaffirms Anderson’s own skill at hand-crafting exquisitely conflicting interior and external worlds.","95","5776858"
"19929","War for the Planet of the Apes is an excellent closing act to this rebooted trilogy, but also one that does enough world-building that the series can potentially continue from here – and it’s a rare case where, after three movies, we’re left wanting more.","95","3450958"
"19930","To hell with that childlike sense-of-wonder crap: Despicable Me, instead of trying to return adults to a false state of innocence, reminds us that we all started out as ill-mannered little savages.","95","1323594"
"19931","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is Martin McDonagh’s most emotional and profound film to date.","95","5027774"
"19932","Fincher and his screenwriter, TV writer-god Aaron Sorkin, have made a seemingly modest picture that achieves something close to greatness the old-fashioned, slow-burning way: By telling a story with faces, dialogue and body language of all types, from awkward to swaggering.","95","1285016"
"19933","Without ever saying so, the movie adds up to nothing less than a social psychology of the nervous, spiritually questing geist of post-World War II America.","95","1560747"
"19934","Observations on the modern office space are dead-on, and I dare you not to laugh out loud at a few of the sophomoric jokes!","95","151804"
"19935","Roma is a special movie that needs that all-encompassing experience. Alfonso Cuarón has made yet another movie that will transport you to another time and place. You will feel like you’re living it.","95","6155172"
"19936","It’s a methodic meditation on living with pain that can’t be shed, and in the oily-black corners of our shared fears, Lonergan has discovered something beautiful, human, and new.","95","4034228"
"19937","This is a movie that’s rife with characters, with incidents, with ideas, with history, and as such, it will benefit from multiple viewings. But even after the first watch, The Irishman hits hard, and it’s a reminder that nearly 30 years after “GoodFellas,” Martin Scorsese still has fascinating mob tales to tell, and fascinating ways to tell them.","95","1302006"
"19938","The result is an embittered look at our world through the eyes of someone who’s increasingly horrified to be a part of it, and a film that’s one of the most searing cinema experiences of the year.","95","6053438"
"19939","It’s a character piece, and one of the best and most understated movies I’ve ever seen about the grieving process.","95","2042568"
"19940","Scott Hicks adapts David Guterson's best-selling novel as if it was poetry.","95","120834"
"19941","What Dee Rees has done here is remarkable. The themes of racial injustice alone would make this movie “important,” but what she’s done with her film makes it an epic.","95","2396589"
"19942","The cultural subtleties Wang inserts purposefully elevate The Farewell to have not only emotional impact but also revelatory social significance.","95","8637428"
"19943","See L.A. Confidential. Be astonished at discovering anew how very, very satisfying movies can still be. And how fine that can feel.","95","119488"
"19944","Few filmmakers are as playfully cynical as the Coens, and in The Ballad of Buster Scruggs they haven’t just made a funny, sentimental, exciting and blistering western, they’ve also unlocked their entire filmography for anyone who may have missed the connections before. And there’s no going back now. It’s the Coen Bros.’ world, and good luck to anyone who lives there.","95","6412452"
"19945","Like the best of fiction, it conveys greater truth about coming to terms with the world at large, and regardless of whether each individual scene is ultimately justified in its inclusion, the cumulative impact of seeing something resembling a life unfold over a mere two hours and forty minutes is overwhelming.","95","1065073"
"19946","The extraordinary success of Arrival is that it combines its bravura style and grand sci-fi questions with tremendous emotional intelligence and a heart so full it’s ready to burst.","95","2543164"
"19947","The Japanese title means chaos, and that is what is let loose when a powerful king foolishly tries to release the reins of power, in the hopes of enjoying a peaceful old age.","95","89881"
"19948","Stan & Ollie muddles up the history a bit, as all biopics do, but it’s a film without any meaningful flaws. Every character is wonderfully realized, every performance is spectacular. You’ll laugh all the way through, you’ll cry by the end, and you’ll see the brilliance of Laurel & Hardy come back to life via the very same cinematic magic that made them legends in the first place.","95","3385524"
"19949","Barry Jenkins' If Beale Street Could Talk is beaming with style and detail, but at its core, it’s a mindful meditation on human beings seeking the greatest gift we can give each other—love.","95","7125860"
"19950","The scene-stealer here is Bill Murray, who, after 25 years of near-hits, finds his most fully realized character yet.","95","128445"
"19951","A direct and heartfelt piece of work. It's conventional, maybe, in its sense of filmmaking decorum, but extraordinary in the way it cuts to the core of human frustration and feelings of inadequacy, reminding us how universal those feelings are.","95","1504320"
"19952","Avengers: Endgame is easily the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s most ambitious, emotional, and affecting film to date, somehow managing to tie up more than a decade of storytelling in a confident (and mostly coherent) climax - a hurdle that many other blockbuster franchises have stumbled over in their final runs.","95","4154796"
"19953","Booksmart is, by far, one of the most perfect coming-of-age comedies I have ever seen.","95","1489887"
"19954","Gerwig has an eye for every step of this character’s journey, and in so doing, sets out on her own path toward what promises to be an exciting directorial career.","95","4925292"
"19955","What makes Little Women particularly refreshing is that Gerwig treats the four March sisters as equals, rather than as right or wrong for wanting different things.","95","3281548"
"19956","Director Yorgos Lanthimos lures us into his dream and shackles us there, for his own fascinating reasons. The experience is exquisite agony, both revelatory and painful. This is one of the best and most disturbing movies of the year.","95","5715874"
"19957","The craft is meticulous and the level of detail elaborate, but the story itself is simple as can be.","95","7984734"
"19958","A mix of forward-looking sci-fi, classic themes, deft plotting and superb writing and direction, Edge of Tomorrow may be the pure-pleasure blockbuster to beat this Summer.","95","1631867"
"19959","So intensely funny that the viewer must hang on every word: comic gems spill forth almost continuously.","96","88258"
"19960","The arguments Black Panther undertakes with itself are central to its architecture, a narrative spine that runs from the first scene to the last.","96","1825683"
"19961","With Marriage Story, Baumbach cements his reputation as one of this generation’s leading humanist filmmakers.","97","7653254"
"19962","Nolan has crafted a film that’s sensational in every sense of the word; it aims for both the heart and the head, to be sure, but arrives there via the central nervous system.","97","5013056"
"19963","Though the film's subject matter is grisly, the electricity between Foster and Hopkins during their prison tête-à-têtes could power every maximum-security prison in this country.","97","102926"
"19964","Grandma is both smart and sweet, mature and bawdy, knowing its characters’ flaws yet open to the possibilities of people acting upon their best instincts. It is without a doubt one of the year’s best films.","98","4270516"
"19965","It is hard to imagine a better tribute to this victory of survival than Nolan’s spare, stunning, extraordinarily ambitious film.","98","5013056"
"19966","It is a film that continually complicates and recomplicates itself, denying viewers the comfort of easy moral footing. It is by turns heartbreaking, harrowing in its violence, and very, very funny, and it features Oscar-level performances by Frances McDormand, Woody Harrelson, and Sam Rockwell.","98","5027774"
"19967","The exploration of political upheaval, class and gender inequalities make this an important film, but the fact that it always remains grounded in its personal story makes Roma a compelling and emotional film, shot masterfully by a veteran director who finally created his masterpiece.","98","6155172"
"19968","By its conclusion, Cuarón’s film proves itself both wonderful and fearsome. See it. You will never forget it.","99","6155172"
"19969","Transcends its star's controversial career and, in the bargain, stands head, shoulders and heart above every other Hollywood movie that we've seen so far this year.","100","298203"
"19970","It may be a deeper film experience than many audiences can withstand: too cynical, too true, too cruel and too heartbreaking. It is about the Algerian war, but those not interested in Algeria may substitute another war; The Battle of Algiers has a universal frame of reference.","100","58946"
"19971","A scathing, ingeniously funny 1960 portrayal of corporate corruption and backstairs sex. [18 March 1988, p.C24]","100","53604"
"19972","A joyful, trippy new incarnation of Spider-Man that you didn’t know you needed, brimming with wit, soul and jaw-dropping visuals.","100","4633694"
"19973","An enormous pleasure. The performances are so fresh and natural – yet so subtle and delicately judged. The direction is superb in its control and the cinematography creates a gripping docu-realist vision.","100","58414"
"19974","In beauty, tone, technical achievement and cinematic artistry on every level, Hyde Park on Hudson is a movie unto itself - funny, believable, historic and hugely entertaining.","100","1477855"
"19975","There’s something so deeply right about this movie, so true to the time depicted and so welcome in this moment; so light in its touch, so properly respectful of its characters, and so big in its spirit that the movie acquires a glow.","100","6966692"
"19976","Toy Story 3 is a salute to the magic of making believe.","100","435761"
"19977","This is Sally Field's movie. Her performance -hyperbole completely aside - is peerless, one of the major achievementsby an actress in the movies of any place and of any time. Reuben tellsNorma Rae that when he wants a smart, loud, profane, sloppy, hardworkingwoman he'll call on her. From now on, when directors want legerdemainthat becomes art, they're going to call on Sally Field.[10 Mar 1979]","100","79638"
"19978","Moonrise Kingdom is Anderson's most completely satisfying film since the one-two of ""Rushmore"" and ""The Royal Tenenbaums,"" in part because it's the perfect distillation of both.","100","1748122"
"19979","It’s as realized a thriller as you are likely to find, not only in the precision of its performances, but in its evocative use of location (Rome, London), its period detail (especially Williams’ clothing) and the tension of the younger Getty’s months-long captivity.","100","5294550"
"19980","Putting the ""intelligence"" in MI6, Skyfall reps a smart, savvy and incredibly satisfying addition to the 007 oeuvre, one that places Judi Dench's M at the center of the action.","100","1074638"
"19981","By the time this irresistible treat is over, it has created some of the funniest moments and most inspired visual humor and design we may expect to experience at the movies all year. [30 Mar 1988]","100","94721"
"19982","It's hard to recall the last time a big-ticket summer movie delivered so fully on its promise.","100","145487"
"19983","The film team is so strong and the direction so fine that it’s simply hard to believe this is actually Talbot’s first full-length feature film. And to detail much more would spoil the genuine surprise of their many on-screen artistic contributions.","100","4353250"
"19984","It's rare to get a good movie about the touchy adult relationship of a sister and brother. Rarer still for the director to be more fascinated by the process than the outcome. This is one of the best movies of the year.","100","203230"
"19985","Sully is an absolute triumph.","100","3263904"
"19986","A genuine odyssey: a journey to self-knowledge.","100","758758"
"19987","What sells Shrek is ultimately the full-bodied personality of its characters.","100","126029"
"19988","Note-perfect performances, a screenplay steeped in both nostalgia and a timely sense of insight, and anti-heroes you can't help but love.","100","64115"
"19989","Through technical virtuosity at every artistic level -- including the brilliant acting debut of playwright Jason Miller as the doubt-filed priest who assists Von Sydow in the exorcism -- The Exorcist becomes more than a shocking movie: a film with a strong, positive force.","100","70047"
"19990","The great thing about Reality Bites is that each of the characters comes across as real, and not some glib concoction by a screenwriter who's watched them from a cloistered distance. Childress obviously knows their world inside out, and shares it with insight and a prickly, original wit. [18 Feb 1994, p.C1]","100","110950"
"19991","This film is the sharpest since ""The Prisoner of Azkaban."" It is the most emotionally satisfying, blending spot-on comedy and adenoidal sexual tension, with scenes of gutsy vulnerability.","100","417741"
"19992","A confidently original, engrossing interpretation.","100","372784"
"19993","If you've never seen Alien on the big screen, this is a must-have cinematic experience that will leave you shivering and adrenalised. And even if you have seen it, the same holds true. It really is that damn good. [2003 re-release]","100","78748"
"19994","A movie so rousing, so real and so full of complicated emotions that it all feels brand-new.","100","964517"
"19995","At first, watching Pacific Rim feels like rediscovering a favourite childhood cartoon – but del Toro has flooded the project with such affection and artistry that, rather than smiling nostalgically, you find yourself enchanted all over again.","100","1663662"
"19996","The movie is brilliant, really. It is philosophy, illustrated through everyday events. Most movies operate as if their events are necessary--that B must follow A. ""13 Conversations"" betrays B, A and all the other letters as random possibilities.","100","268690"
"19997","Levinson invests his script with a richness of theme that helps make it a comedy classic.","100","94155"
"19998","Not only is The Shape of Water one of del Toro’s most stunningly successful works, it’s also a powerful vision of a creative master feeling totally, joyously free.","100","5580390"
"19999","Kidman, in a career-best performance, and Eckhart lend pitch-perfect calibration to the couple's shared and separate agonies. It's as if previous treatments of the subject were a series of failed experiments, and Rabbit Hole is the Eureka! moment.","100","935075"
"20000","Land of the Dead is Romero's long-awaited masterpiece, a slyly suspenseful and droll thrill-ride that expounds on both the highbrow and the chewed-off-brow concepts of his previous trilogy, then flippantly dismisses the cheap scare tactics of the control-pad generation's gimmicky genre knockoffs.","100","418819"
"20001","By now, everyone knows who wins, but the scenes before the fight set us up for it so completely, so emotionally, that when it's over we've had it. We're drained.","100","75148"
"20002","Representing a dazzling artistic leap forward for LAIKA, the stop-motion animation studio’s fourth feature — and first full-blown fantasy — is an eye-popping delight that deftly blends colorful folklore with gorgeous, origami-informed visuals to immersive effect.","100","4302938"
"20003","I haven't been so captivated, chilled and surprised by a movie in years.","100","167404"
"20004","Since Joy is a David O. Russell film, the presence of a) Lawrence and b) bizarre, fizz-popping explosions of catharsis are to be expected. But the ringmaster of The Fighter, Silver Linings Playbook and American Hustle seems to have mellowed a little, which means fewer outright belly laughs, but a more layered and involving emotional landscape.","100","2446980"
"20005","""Cloverfield"" director Matt Reeves hasn't ruined the elegant Swedish vampire story by remaking it. If anything, he's made some improvements, including the addition of a tense action-horror sequence in the middle of the film.","100","1228987"
"20006","While no one is going to place Costner alongside Laurence Olivier in the acting department, he brings a likability to Dunbar that many better performers might not have been able to match.","100","99348"
"20007","Martin Scorsese’s Mean Streets is a true original of our period, a triumph of personal filmmaking. It has its own hallucinatory look; the charac­ters live in the darkness of bars, with lighting and color just this side of lurid. It has its own unsettling, episodic rhythm and a high-charged emo­tional range that is dizzyingly sensual.","100","70379"
"20008","The movie's satisfactions are subtle, but they run deep, and there are many.","100","781435"
"20009","It's gloriously absurd. This movie has holes in it big enough to drive the whole movie through. The laws of physics seem to be suspended here the same way as in a Road Runner cartoon.","100","944835"
"20010","Among the funniest and most satisfying films I've seen in years.","100","140397"
"20011","The performances are crucial, because all of these characters have so completely internalized their world that they make it palpable, and themselves utterly convincing.","100","206634"
"20012","A heady flow of brilliant stupidity.","100","88258"
"20013","Real Genius is great, the freshest, most insouciant Hollywood inspirationsince Risky Business. Director Martha Coolidge was handed a fleet cast anda well- oiled screenplay and she plumb took off. The darn thing works sowell it fairly sings. [12 Aug 1985]","100","89886"
"20014","This is smart, silky, sensitive, and funny old-school movie magic.","100","1193138"
"20015","Black Swan is visceral and real even while it's one delirious, phantasmagoric freakout.","100","947798"
"20016","A brilliantly truthful film on a subject that is usually shrouded in wishful thinking, mythmongering and outright denial.","100","1327773"
"20017","Stands next to Young Frankenstein as Brooks' best movie, and, of course, boasts the god of all fart gags.","100","71230"
"20018","The ambition of Under the Silver Lake is worth cherishing. It will either evaporate into nothingness or cohere into something you’ll want to hug for being so wonderfully weird.","100","5691670"
"20019","Funny People is a true brass ring effort, a reach for excellence that takes big risks. It's 146 minutes, with a story that's more European in feeling than American.","100","1201167"
"20020","The story Stiller tells manages to float in a most peculiar, satisfying way.","100","359950"
"20021","Emma is the peak of the recent Austen pack and a star-maker, too -- an antidote to a summer in which even good movies have subordinated writing and characters to special effects. [02 Aug 1996, Pg.01.D]","100","116191"
"20022","Director Carl Franklin, who also adapted the screenplay from Walter Mosley's prize-winning novel, isn't particularly concerned with the machinations of mystery plots. Nor is he seduced by the temptations of noir visual style (although Tak Fujimoto's camera work is plenty stylish).","100","112857"
"20023","On its bright face, The Imitation Game, written by Graham Moore and directed by Morten Tyldum, fits into that cozy genre of tortured-genius biopics that sprout like kudzu just in time for the Oscars. But that’s not fair to the film, which outthinks and outplays other examples of the genre.","100","2084970"
"20024","Considering Haneke's confrontational past, this poignantly acted, uncommonly tender two-hander makes a doubly powerful statement about man's capacity for dignity and sensitivity when confronted with the inevitable cruelty of nature.","100","1602620"
"20025","In its entirety, Hairspray has the funny tilt that only a director-choreographer like Shankman can give to a movie.","100","427327"
"20026","A wonderful movie...It isn't remarkable visually, but features some of the best young actors in the country.","100","83833"
"20027","The film's immense cast and crew, headed by director Michael Bay, writer Randall Wallace and stars Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale, blend artistry and technology to create a blockbuster entertainment that has passion, valor and tremendous action.","100","213149"
"20028","The moments between the characters are absolutely full. It's a pleasure to watch such consummate professionals.","100","337741"
"20029","The film's freedom and control, its inspiration and focus, announce it as the work of a confident and mature artist.","100","497465"
"20030","Cinematographer Willis superbly captures the turn-of-the-century period, applying a seriographic tint to flashback scenes for a softer, richer look than the sharp image of the ongoing contemporary story.","100","71562"
"20031","Hail, Caesar! is pure, popcorn fun — a visual treat, a comedic tour de force and a sublime and sly slice of satire.","100","475290"
"20032","The chase influenced a generation of filmmakers, and Hackman's Popeye Doyle put an indelible stamp on the archetypal burned-out cop who was to become such a ubiquitous presence in movies. [12 March 1999, p.16]","100","67116"
"20033","This bracing movie...gets off to a spirited start and rarely lets up, sharing with viewers a little-known chapter of history as inspiring as it is intriguing.","100","4846340"
"20034","One of the most sheerly enjoyable films of recent years, this sophisticated horror comedy, written and directed by Brian De Palma, is permeated with the distilled essence of impure thoughts.","100","80661"
"20035","Tempers moments of despair with deliriously romantic passages abetted by James Horner's traditionally lush score and photography by John Toll (""Legends of the Fall's"" Oscar winner).","100","112573"
"20036","In a severe, uncompromising manner that none of his previous films has approached, Spielberg has captured the terror of the Nazi reign as well as the determination and resourcefulness of those who resisted. He has created one of the most shocking movies yet made about the Holocaust (there were several walkouts at the screening I attended) and one of the most inspiring.","100","108052"
"20037","Destroyed yet defiant, Robbie walks the emotional tightrope of the most fabulously, tragically American film of the year.","100","5580036"
"20038","This smashing science-fiction adaptation of H.G. Wells's famous novel has more creativity in every frame than most latter-day rip-offs have in their entirety.","100","54387"
"20039","It takes a genuine master craftsman to take something as complex and difficult as this and make it look easy, but it also takes an artist with a great ear to take something as dense with exposition as this is and make it practically sing.","100","3659388"
"20040","Empire of the Sun is such a grand, successful blend of epic filmmaking and personal drama, it's hard to believe Steven Spielberg made it. [11 Dec 1987, p.G15]","100","92965"
"20041","Utterly absorbing, extremely smart and - considering this is a sad, shabby, drably grey-green world of obsessives, misfits, misdirection, disillusionment, self-delusion and treachery - quite beautifully executed.","100","1340800"
"20042","So phenomenal that Bill Murray can't even steal it. And he tries. So excellent that Murray's MTV progeny Tom Green can't sink it.","100","160127"
"20043","A truly majestic visual tone poem.","100","257044"
"20044","More than anything this is an intelligent film, a satisfying bit of old-school sci-fi suspense.","100","1182345"
"20045","One terrific movie... Pacino and Depp are a match made in acting heaven, riffing off each other with astonishing subtlety and wit.","100","119008"
"20046","The film’s indisputable centerpiece is the protracted werewolf transformation sequence.","100","82010"
"20047","Trainwreck is more than funny. It's also wise, and that hard-won wisdom makes this a can't-miss for anyone who feels bruised by love, but never beaten.","100","3152624"
"20048","Ford's film, shot by Gregg Toland with magnificent, lyrical simplicity, captures the stark plainness of the migrants, stripped to a few possessions, left with innumerable relations and little hope.","100","32551"
"20049","I don't know what vast significance Michael Clayton has (it involves deadly pollution but isn't a message movie). But I know it is just about perfect as an exercise in the genre.","100","465538"
"20050","Effervescent, unflappable, supremely pleased with herself, Cher (delightfully played by the much-publicized Alicia Silverstone) is the comic centerpiece of Clueless, a wickedly funny teen-age farce from writer-director Amy Heckerling that, like its heroine, turns out to have more to it than anyone could anticipate. [19 July 1995]","100","112697"
"20051","Like any creative endeavor a film is the sum of its parts. In the most elementary terms it needs a screenplay as a base, a cast to bring the script to life and a director to orchestrate the pieces into something of considerable impact. Excuse the hyperbole, but Tom McCarthy's Spotlight is an example of when all those pieces fit together almost perfectly.","100","1895587"
"20052","This is one of the greatest performances in the history of the cinema.","100","340855"
"20053","In his big-screen directing debut, British film maker Danny Boyle demonstrates wit, intelligence and economy of style.","100","111149"

"20058","An excessive, expressionistic, agreeably nonjudgmental period biography that carries with it an enormous emotional wallop. [01 Mar 1991]","100","101761"
"20059","To talk more about the movie's layers is to risk giving away too much. I'll say only that this film confirms Nolan's status as the director whose work I look forward to more than any other.","100","482571"
"20060","It's clever, farcical and offers wry social commentary. With its heartfelt performances, intelligent writing and subtle humor, this is easily one of the most perceptive and engaging movies of the year.","100","2390361"
"20061","Enough about the CGI tweaking, is this film really Lucas's unloved masterpiece? The film that got lost in the shadow of ""American Graffitti"" and ""Star Wars"" while, actually, being a better film?","100","66434"
"20062","Despite the gender gap between the film’s creator and his subjects, the film is beautifully perceptive and, at times, deeply poignant. Mills has created the kind of comedy in which you laugh with recognition because its dilemmas feel so familiar.","100","4385888"
"20063","Three decades ago, Milk and his ilk were able to enlist President Jimmy Carter and future President Ronald Reagan in the gay fight against Prop. 6. But this fall, Barack Obama was all but mute on Prop. 8. Some community organizers, like the President-elect, are more cautious than others. It's a shame Harvey Milk wasn't around to recruit him.","100","1013753"
"20064","A masterpiece. A work of grand visual wit, clever songs, funny gags and genuine pathos, it is perhaps the greatest stop-motion animated film ever, a painstaking style of model animation that computers have all but completely done away with.","100","107688"
"20065","As an action film — which in small bursts it is — Blue Ruin is disquieting and raw, like Commando turned inside out.","100","2359024"
"20066","Big Fish really is a big delight.","100","319061"
"20067","You'll laugh, you'll cry -- the year's best movie.","100","265666"
"20068","Few films are ever as enjoyable and endearing as Sing Street.","100","3544112"
"20069","My only complaint about Naked Gun 2 1/2 is that it doesn't give you enough time to finish laughing at one gag before the next one comes along, cracking you up all over again. Naked Gun 2 1/2 is high-flying low comedy, 90 minutes of sublime nonsense that only the devoutly humorless could hate. [28 June 1991, p.69]","100","102510"
"20070","Before Sunrise is a film that first startles you with its simplicity, then bowls you over with its complexity.","100","112471"
"20071","While adhering to an internal logic that makes each punchline land with a satisfying burst of glee, the movie nevertheless stems from genuine fury aimed a broken world. It's the rare storytelling endeavor that manages to be laughably absurd and profoundly tragic at the same time.","100","3011894"
"20072","Intelligent and crackling with crisp, provocative visual energy, Copycat, the new thriller starring Sigourney Weaver and Holly Hunter, is so creepy and dangerous-feeling that it's like a knife edge pressed against the jugular.","100","112722"
"20073","While MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON is the most moral of films, it is so artfully filled with real emotion that it never becomes heavy-handed.","100","31679"
"20074","Perrotta and Field succeed, not by guessing, but by knowing this world. They understand it enough to see it with cold precision -- and to approach it, at times, with disarming warmth. The characters aren't types, but people.","100","404203"
"20075","Tilling some of the same conspiracy turf he explored in ""All the President's Men,"" Pakula has improved on Grisham's book by excising much of the detritus, crafting a taut, intelligent thriller that succeeds on almost every level.","100","107798"
"20076","By the time Tully hits its homestretch -- and its nicely played third-act revelation -- it all ends up making perfect, beautiful sense. In the process, Tully becomes the sweetest, funniest, most insightful portrayal of post-partum depression you're likely to see for some time.","100","5610554"
"20077","The effect is like watching an opera without music. Or a musical drama in which no one sings. These departures from a realistic convention never feel like static set pieces - that's the great success of the film and of the poems themselves.","100","1405500"
"20078","Double Indemnity is the season's nattiest, nastiest, most satisfying melodrama.","100","36775"
"20079","One of the best police movies in recent years, a virtuoso fusion of performances and often startling action.","100","1855199"
"20080","An emotional smackdown. Rourke's never been better, and the change of pace and texture suits Aronofsky perfectly. ""The Raging Bull"" of wrestling movies? Oh, go on then.","100","1125849"
"20081","A conventionally heightened series of escapes and clashes and hide-and-seek gambits, yet the way the film has been made, nothing that happens seems inevitable -- which is to say, anything seems possible. There's a word for that sensation. It's called excitement.","100","372183"
"20082","There's not a scene here where Badham doesn't seem to know what he's doing, weaving a complex web of computerese, personalities and puzzles; the movie absorbs us on emotional and intellectual levels at the same time. And the ending, a moment of blinding and yet utterly elementary insight, is wonderful.","100","86567"
"20083","Barry Sonnenfeld's stunning cinematography and the sharply etched characterizations make this film one for the ages.","100","100150"
"20084","Back to the Future entertainingly deals with the child's eternal question: If my parents had never met, where would that leave me?","100","88763"
"20085","One of the greatest films about the civilian experience of war ever made anywhere.","100","118799"
"20086","The women are remarkable, unforgettable. But don’t overlook Nivola, an enigmatic figure as the rabbi and husband.","100","6108178"
"20087","One of the great New York films, swathing the city in a layers of dewy love and glossy chic. [Review of re-release]","100","54698"
"20088","Smart people will relish its temerariousness, average people will smile awkwardly and comment that it's ""kinda different,"" and dimly lit people may mistake it for the Elmo movie and drool quietly in the back rows. It's a movie for everyone.","100","120601"
"20089","The film is stupendous: as antic as Boogie Nights and Punch-Drunk Love, but with The Master and There Will Be Blood’s uncanny feel for the swell and ebb of history.","100","1791528"
"20090","One of modern American film’s most intelligent and provocative accounts of a nation’s political failings, and a near-perfect depiction of journalism at its purist and most inspired. To be more succinct, it is quite brilliant.","100","74119"
"20091","Batman Returns could mark a happy beginning for Hollywood -- not because it might make a mint but because it dispenses with realism and aspires to animation, to the freedom of idea and image found in the best feature-length cartoons.","100","103776"
"20092","What makes The Two Popes so delightful, other than the very funny script, is watching two seasoned actors play off each other for two hours. Both Hopkins and Pryce illustrate what the craft of acting is really about.","100","8404614"
"20093","Henry Fool is far and away writer-director Hal Hartley's best movie.","100","122529"
"20094","If the characters weren't so well drawn, if the effects weren't so convincing, and if the upshot weren't so ghastly, the moral component wouldn't carry any weight. But Trank tells his tale with an emotional and visual crispness that gives the superhero genre its best crack at naturalism so far.","100","1706593"
"20095","Granddaddy of beast-on-the-loose movies.","100","24216"
"20096","At its best, Fury examines the psychological experience of warfare.","100","2713180"
"20097","Barry's questions are powerful whether asked by a future president or a future janitor. The script is great no matter who it's about — it's just that fewer curiosity-seekers would give it a watch were it about someone else.","100","5477566"
"20098","This is one of the most entertaining science-fiction fantasies ever to come out of Hollywood.","100","63442"
"20099","This blisteringly cynical satire, written by Paddy Chayefsky, is one of the darkest movies ever made, a cold-eyed lament for a society torn apart by upheavals of the Sixties.","100","67217"
"20100","The best and most lavishly appointed, gorgeously photographed period movie in years.","100","5437928"
"20101","A biting satire of military myopia and political double-dealing -- possibly the best wartime comedy since Robert Altman's ""M*A*S*H.""","100","120188"
"20102","It is a creamily sensuous, richly observed piece of work, handsomely detailed and furnished: the clothes, the hair, the automobiles, the train carriages, the record players, the lipstick and the cigarettes are all superbly presented. The combination of all this is intoxicating in itself.","100","2402927"
"20103","As far as animated movies go, it doesn't get that much better than Frozen. It's a new Disney classic.","100","2294629"
"20104","Shot for shot, Big Eyes is one of the most beautiful-looking movies of 2014, but to say that isn’t enough, because it’s not just pretty, not just pleasing to the eye. It’s visually astute. It is made by people aware of what these screen images mean, what they refer to, and the psychological effect that they will have on an audience.","100","1126590"
"20105","It is a remarkable achievement in filmmaking, a beautiful and brutal work.","100","181865"
"20106","It's a terrific movie, smart and funny enough to hold up at any time of year.","100","319343"
"20107","As for that famous last line, “Well, nobody’s perfect,” it’s best left uncontextualized for those who haven’t seen it. It’s Hollywood’s subtlest moment of compassion, a wink and a hug at the same time, and the reason why the movie will always be immortal.","100","53291"
"20108","With a surgical saw instead of a hatchet, del Toro takes apart patriarchy and opportunistic religion as well as fascism.","100","457430"
"20109","Nima Nourizadeh’s American Ultra is a bloody valentine attached to a bomb. It’s violent, brash, inventive and horrific, and perhaps the most romantic film of the year.","100","3316948"
"20110","Far From Heaven would have been one of the great American films of the '50s; it is certainly the finest American melodrama of our time.","100","297884"
"20111","Klute still perhaps stands as Pakula's finest moment. Informed in part by the conventions of film noir - duplicitous female, ambitious private investigator, and murky goings on of the sexual variety - Klute manages to distill them all into something highly original and distinctly unsettling.","100","67309"
"20112","The film’s sweetness and bitterness are held so perfectly in balance, and realised with such sinew-stiffening intensity, that watching it feels like a three-hour sports massage for your heart and soul.","100","4048272"
"20113","Robert Wise has transformed the delightful Rodgers and Hammerstein musical stage production of ""The Sound of Music"" into a magical film in which Julie Andrews gives an endearing performance in the role of Maria, the governess.","100","59742"
"20114","The Stranger is not as wildly creative as his other films, but all the Welles trademarks are present, including superior lighting, inventive camera angles, strong transitions, and characters silhouetted in darkness.","100","38991"
"20115","The combination of a literate script, an adroit cast and an economical style is simple addition that achieves an alchemical feat: the best film of the year.","100","1174732"
"20116","It’s a reinvented romantic comedy, sassy and fun, that doesn’t necessarily rely on obvious tropes and is worth the wait.","100","3104988"
"20117","Body Double, while not his finest, is the best candidate as De Palma’s signature film. It’s a wicked, feature-length double entendre from a Doublemint era. Take it at face value, take it for its prurience or take it for all it’s worth. Hell, try taking on all three at once.","100","86984"
"20118","Chilling Fosse vision of Weimar Berlin, stylishly directed and choreographed, featuring a show-stopping musical performance by Minnelli, Grey's unforgettable emcee and thoughtful acting from Michael York.","100","68327"
"20119","Five Easy Pieces is the very definition of a character study, and one of the best American cinema has produced.","100","65724"
"20120","The title of Never Look Away is deliciously ironic: This is one of the most mesmerizing, compulsively watchable films in theaters right now.","100","5311542"
"20121","A screwball surrealist comedy that asks us to laugh at an unconventional romance while also disarming us with the realization that its fantasy scenario isn't too far from our present reality.","100","1798709"
"20122","It's crucial to note, too, that this isn't just a nice little movie for older people: There's some real bite to the way it deals with the life questions that come with aging, and whatever sweetness it has is just an undertone, not a feel-good frosting overlay.","100","3236120"
"20123","The picture draws out the obvious and turns itself into a classic. [26 June 1989]","100","97165"
"20124","Brooks's most accomplished work, combining his well-known brand of comedy with stylish direction and a uniformly excellent cast.","100","72431"
"20125","There is much to praise about this sweet, smart comedy of intergenerational conflict and solidarity.... But honestly, the wonder that is Grandma can be summed up in two words: Lily Tomlin.","100","4270516"
"20126","An awe-inspiring film.","100","2935510"
"20127","As is customary in Mr. Baumbach’s pictures, the acting is spectacular.","100","5536736"
"20128","As sad and poignant and potentially hopeful as it is amusing. The movie is our story as much as it is Schmidt's, no matter if it's viewed as a self-reflection or cautionary tale","100","257360"
"20129","The Kids Are All Right probably could have used a few more scenes to come to an even more satisfying conclusion. But it's a terrific film anyway.","100","842926"
"20130","Room is more than the title of one of the year’s most powerful movies — it’s a state of mind that’s unbearably tense and as claustrophobic as a straitjacket","100","3170832"
"20131","A serious movie that slowly earns its emotion and enlists our involvement. Even before the finish, it’s goosebumps all around.","100","4669788"
"20132","All the up-from-under satisfaction of an underdog getting over, with the added oomph of the truth.","100","195685"
"20133","This beautifully structured fable may be focused on the specific pain, of a specific child, during a specific moment in time, but it blows up every fragment of its premise into heart-stirring universal appeal.","100","3416532"
"20134","This movie has everything but Humphrey Bogart, and I'm sure he's sorry he was unavailable.","100","114814"
"20135","The most un-MGM movie that the studio ever made gave Dracula director Tod Browning the chance to tell a story that horrified audiences. [13 Aug 2004, p.4E]","100","22913"
"20136","A feast of a film that goes on feeding you long after you've left the theater. [25 Dec 1995, p.83]","100","115012"
"20137","The most literally exciting film you will see this year. Forget the off-putting banner of another Iraq movie -- go, watch, marvel, endure and book in the palliative of a stiff drink afterwards.","100","887912"
"20138","A thumpingly good ode to friendship, hope, wit, wiles and wisdom, brimming with crackling characters and topped with the most twisteroo of twists since ""The Crying Game.""","100","111161"
"20139","It is a smart, supremely watchable and entertaining film, and Close gives a wonderful star turn.","100","3750872"
"20140","It is boldly NC-17, but unlike most exploitation cinema, Ferrara can’t seem to help himself from making the film a personal, frightened psychic diary, a pitiful shriek for help, and a powerful statement about how even the damned can achieve a moment of fleeting grace.","100","103759"
"20141","In short, Batman is terrific - funny, smart and sensitive too, the perfect cinematic date.","100","96895"
"20142","Take a funny, touching, complex play that moves at a breakneck pace, filter it through the huge (if often underrated) talents of director Fred Schepisi, and you've got Six Degrees of Separation. Such a rare gift - a film that treats language with infinite respect and ideas with cultivated precision, a film that challenges us to keep up and rewards our efforts with a bittersweet comedy of manners. [24 Dec 1993]","100","108149"
"20143","The movie is tough-minded: It zeroes in on Patrick's anger at dating a closeted football star, and it doesn't let Charlie off the hook for his cruelty or self-pity.","100","1659337"
"20144","John Wayne's Ethan is his all-time top performance: funny, romantic, hard-bitten, scary, the personification of machismo.","100","49730"
"20145","The invisible wizard Peter Jackson makes use of every scene to show us the meaning of magnificence. Never has a filmmaker aimed higher, or achieved more.","100","167260"
"20146","The rare expert film bio. Coal Miner's Daughter features an Oscar-winning performance by Sissy Spacek as country music queen Loretta Lynn. Masterfully directed by Michael Apted, the film traces the famed country singer's life from her beginnings in a tumbledown shack in Butcher Hollow, Kentucky, through her huge success, marital discord, and battle with prescription drugs.","100","80549"
"20147","The drama it might remind you most of, oddly enough, is ""Six Degrees of Separation,"" also about the snowballing connections between unlikely people. And as in that urban clash, the bedrock of it all is social responsibility, ever crumbling and rebuilding. A total triumph.","100","1832382"
"20148","One of Hitchcock's very best comic thrillers, North by Northwest features scene after unforgettable scene.","100","53125"
"20149","The result is mainstream moviemaking at its highest, most satisfying level.","100","268978"
"20150","Paul Newman won his Best Actor Oscar for its 1986 sequel, The Color of Money, but he executed an equally award-worthy turn in Robert Rossen’s jazzy, boozy pool-hall morality play.","100","54997"
"20151","Over the years, Phoenix has given us some of the most memorable portraits of dark flawed men from Commodus to Johnny Cash. Here, he is excellent, utterly convincing as a man who has been hammered by the world and so has decided to hammer it back.","100","5742374"
"20152","Director Charles Crichton's hilarious romp.","100","95159"
"20153","Kramer vs. Kramer is, essentially, a television movie that was raised into the feature category by the excellence of the execution.","100","79417"
"20154","It's a startling physical transformation, as Noland goes from flabby desk jockey to lean, mean fishing machine. But even more remarkable is the mental transformation Hanks effects.","100","162222"
"20155","The Incredibles has that rare quality of feeling modern and classic at the same time.","100","317705"
"20156","Die Hard 2, which is far and away the best of the big summer action pictures, is an almost perfect blend of suspense, thrills, human drama and, perhaps most important, comedy. [6 July 1990, p.3F]","100","99423"
"20157","The Thing has emerged as one of our most potent modern terrors, combining the icy-cold chill of suspicion and uncertainty with those magnificently imaginative effects blowouts.","100","84787"
"20158","A masterpiece.","100","147612"
"20159","Spring Breakers seems to be holding a funhouse mirror up to the face of youth-driven pop culture, leaving us uncertain whether to laugh, recoil in horror, or marvel at its strange beauty. All I knew is I couldn't wait to see it a second time.","100","2101441"
"20160","Garden State gets it. Not since ""The Graduate"" has a movie nailed the beautiful terror of standing on the brink of adulthood with such satisfying precision.","100","333766"
"20161","It hardly rewrites the rulebook, but Warrior is a powerful, moving and brilliant sports-pic-cum-family drama. Like ""The Fighter,"" but with kicking.","100","1291584"
"20162","A captivating 1930s-set caper whose innumerable surface pleasures might just seduce you into overlooking its sly intelligence and depth of feeling.","100","2278388"
"20163","Raising Arizona is the best comedy about kidnapping ever made. Small category, admittedly. This is a film that gets a laugh -- legitimate, unqualified, not a sick laugh at all -- out of a running gag in which a baby is left in the middle of an Arizona highway by thugs on the lam. Cars bear down, a ""biker from Hell"" attacks. How many filmmakers could get away with baby-in-jeopardy jokes? [10 Apr 1987, p.D1]","100","93822"
"20164","Usually, the plot of a romantic comedy revolved around two people wanting to marry each other. With Powell and Loy, with their charm, warmth and sex appeal, the story became about two people who were married -- and liked it. [02 Aug 2005, p.E1]","100","25878"
"20165","The tough beauty of the picture is that it lets each viewer weigh the costs and benefits to Gardner. It's a genuinely transporting inspirational movie because it's also a cautionary tale. It doesn't downplay the hero's occasional clumsiness or pigheadedness.","100","454921"
"20166","The best, surely the smartest, English-language movie of the year to date.","100","425112"
"20167","It’s real Streetcar Named Desire territory as the fights pile up, and if you think that doesn’t sound entertaining, know that it is, in a hypnotically catastrophic way.","100","2334873"
"20168","The most powerfully entrancing children's film in years. Of course, a true kid's classic is just as magical for adults.","100","304141"
"20169","Don't be too quick to jump on Hurt with complaints of old-fashioned gay stereotyping. Only with a development well into the movie will the audience realize the layers he brought to Molina's role-playing.","100","89424"
"20170","1917 is Mendes’s most purely ambitious and passionate picture since his misunderstood and under-appreciated Jarhead of 2005. It’s bold, thrilling film-making.","100","8579674"
"20171","The casting of Reeves in the lead role is inspired: who better than the star of ""The Matrix"" and its sequels, a trilogy that borrows heavily from Dick's sensibility and obsessions, to play a personality split through overindulgence in drugs and manipulation by outside forces he barely recognizes?","100","405296"
"20172","This film has a voice of its own. And at a time when the romantic comedy seems to be a lost art form, that's saying something.","100","1405365"
"20173","Van Dormael has crafted a saga that, even at two-plus hours, is endlessly, enormously watchable.","100","485947"
"20174","This remarkable analysis of a decade whenAmerican society lost its moral compass is both brutally honest and lyrically compassionate.","100","119349"
"20175","The film is inspirational and educational - and it is also entertaining, as movies must be before they can be anything else.","100","104797"
"20176","The Big Easy is one of the richest American films of the year. It also happens to be a great thriller.","100","92654"
"20177","A tour de force so haunting that other films can't exorcise the memory of its radiant cast, exquisite craftsmanship or complex system of metaphors. This, ladies and gentlemen, is a movie.","100","116209"
"20178","It's a remarkable film: A gritty, gut-churning, crime thriller based on a true story. Its greatness lies in its unwavering fidelity to human nature and the unstoppable laws of the wild.","100","1313092"
"20179","Full force Will Ferrell at his best. And as an added bonus, we all get one of the funniest movies of the year...that is if you don't mind your humor on the rude and crude side.","100","357413"
"20180","The movie masterfully evokes, through stunning direction and magnificent performances, the heat and passion of desperate people living in desperate times. [18 Feb 1983]","100","86617"
"20181","With Vox Lux, Corbet has delivered a towering film, a unique uncompromising vision that reveals the darkness on the edge of town that lurks in the depths of the spotlight. It’s funny, thrilling, deadly serious and achieves genuine depth.","100","5960374"
"20182","This is a sequel that has its own story to tell and that gets right down to it, and it expands on the ideas from the first film, but in a way that tells a thematically satisfying and complete story. In other words, this is how franchises are supposed to work.","100","1646971"
"20183","Feig has done a superb job of building a compelling story from angular bits that shouldn’t fit together but do while making pointed commentary on everything from gender roles to social media.","100","7040874"
"20184","All this is dramatized expertly and with a lightness of touch in Simon Beaufoy’s screenplay and in the direction of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, the team behind “Little Miss Sunshine.”","100","4622512"
"20185","It plays like one of Linklater’s most intimate gifts, an adult rumination on the tricky subject of patriotism.","100","6018306"
"20186","Unquestionalby it's an instant classic, probably the grisliest well-made movie ever. [26 May 1983]","100","83907"
"20187","Who's going to love it? Anyone with a sense of humor: Team America: World Police is hands-down the funniest movie of the year.","100","372588"
"20188","This is a movie that surprises you. The setup is such familiar material that you think the story is going to be flat and fast. But the screenplay by John Lee Hancock goes deep. And the direction by Clint Eastwood finds strange, quiet moments of perfect truth in the story.","100","107808"
"20189","One of the greatest science and moral fiction movies ever made.","100","93593"
"20190","Director Richard Rush's unique moviemaking saga is one of the consummate screen treats of its day, though its offbeat subject matter and tone caused it some problems. [23 Nov 2001, p.8E]","100","81568"
"20191","One of the best film musicals in years -- exuberant, sexy and life affirming in equal measure.","100","294870"
"20192","This is Spielberg operating at his peak - an exceptionally made, provocative and vital film for our times.","100","408306"
"20193","This is the legal movie that lawyers most often praise for its realism, in terms of not only story but also tone and atmosphere. It's full of great scenes. [08 Apr 2012, p.P19]","100","52561"
"20194","Taken a little too seriously, My Cousin Vinny can be seen as a celebration of the breadth and richness of the American landscape. Maybe the movie isn't exactly about that, but to enjoy it is, in a small way, to celebrate that richness.[13 Mar 1992, p.D3]","100","104952"
"20195","That such intelligence could be contained in a movie that is simultaneously so funny and so entertaining is some kind of a miracle.","100","98258"
"20196","Marriage Story may often resemble a tug of war between its stars, but it’s on both of their sides.","100","7653254"
"20197","This is a baseball movie with virtually no actual baseball footage in it -- yet you're so involved with the characters that you don't miss it in the slightest. Cobb is a brilliant film. And with it, Ron Shelton elevates himself to the top shelf of American filmmakers. [06 Jan 1995, p.C1]","100","109450"
"20198","Potentially oppressive subject matter is redeemed by impeccable moral integrity and stunning artistry.","100","163988"
"20199","Rain is a 126-minute genre movie stacked for effect; when you see Douglas racing his motorcycle at the beginning, you know what the climax will be. Scott, though, may be the definitive state-of-the-art moviemaker right now - and violent Rain is the most aggressively cinematic movie in a while. [22 Sep 1989, p.1D]","100","96933"

"20201","A lean and mean horror comedy classic.","100","144084"
"20202","It took the German restorers four years to ready this print using dupe negatives and old prints found in archives around the world. Their work speaks for itself. Each frame of this classic is drop-dead stunning, the more so now that the movie no longer hiccups its way across the screen.","100","17136"
"20203","A caustic comedy of Hollywood manners.","100","254099"
"20204","The Cabin in the Woods isn't merely another ""Scream"" exercise in self-awareness, or a ""Scary Movie"" spoof of the same. It's a wickedly smart hybrid mutation, biting the severed hand feeding the genre.","100","1259521"
"20205","Like the wood-grained farmhouse itself — a beautiful piece of production design by Julie Berghoff — The Conjuring has an analog solidity that makes the terror to come almost unbearable.","100","1457767"
"20206","The kind of parable that encourages us to re-evaluate the good old days and take a fresh look at the new world we so easily dismiss as decadent.","100","120789"
"20207","You hire an actor for his strengths, and Downey would not be strong as a one-dimensional mighty-man. He is strong because he is smart, quick and funny, and because we sense his public persona masks deep private wounds. By building on that, Favreau found his movie, and it's a good one.","100","371746"
"20208","A magnificent science-fiction film, all the more intriguing because it raises questions about the origin of human life and doesn't have the answers.","100","1446714"
"20209","Redford, already a giant, has never been more suggestive. His character’s misadventure — might be a kind of cosmic penance. It’s the salvation of the moviegoing year.","100","2017038"
"20210","The movie toggles between two periods-before and after a catastrophe-and, were it not for Swinton's magnetism, it would be unbearable. Instead, you'll want to stay for the wallop.","100","1242460"
"20211","Engaging and consummately entertaining.","100","120780"
"20212","The best Hannibal Lecter movie and one of the greatest suspense movies ever made... A lurid masterpiece that pays homage to the seductiveness of pulp, not by dressing it in the trappings of fine art but by stripping it to the essentials of what we responded to in the material in the first place.","100","91474"
"20213","A technological triumph. [19 May 1980]","100","80684"
"20214","Spartacus isn't the greatest epic ever made, but it's head and shoulders above most of the sword-and-sandal wheezers that came out in the '50s and '60s. And, given the prohibitive costs of shooting an epic today, it's the kind of movie we're not likely to see anymore -- except in well-deserved revivals like this one. [13 May 1991, p.E1]","100","54331"
"20215","A Quiet Place is full of fabulous, virtuoso action set pieces, but mere hours after seeing it, what I’m already flashing on the most are the ways in which each member of this family, children and adults alike, tries to carry the weight of their central burden, which isn’t fear and dread, but guilt and grief, two monsters no third act plot twist can ever quite vanquish.","100","6644200"
"20216","A terrific, sophisticated comedy that tackles serious issues with a lightness of touch and a spirit of steel, Philomena is the British film to beat come BAFTA time.","100","2431286"
"20217","It’s an exciting sports movie, an inspiring tale of prejudice overcome and, above all, a fascinating study of political leadership.","100","1057500"

"20220","Stealth is a key element of tension and, even though DePalma tosses his share of fireballs around, Mission: Impossible gets edgier when it gets quieter. The audience's rapt, empathetic silence while Hunt hangs there in peril proves how well the director does it. [24 May 1996, p.5]","100","117060"
"20221","It brings together several popular strains of contemporary moviemaking and combines them into one big, shameless, audacious, compulsively watchable, irresistibly likable piece of pure entertainment.","100","1250777"
"20222","With the help of an impeccable cast and with a style steeped in the past, Soderbergh has placed the persona ofKafka under a lens, and the soul he discovers is his own. [31 Jan. 1992]","100","102181"
"20223","Dispassionate engagement won't fly here. You either stagger out early or plunge in up to your elbows.","100","1034415"
"20224","Jackson's big monkey picture show is certainly the best popular entertainment of the year. The film is a wondrous blend of then and now: It honors its mythic predecessor of 1933 while using sophisticated movie technology to seamlessly manipulate the fantastic.","100","360717"
"20225","One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest is the best film therapy one can recommend.","100","73486"
"20226","Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull is the best American movie of the year, Scorsese's best film and at long last replaces Robert Wise's ""The Set-Up"" (1949) as the best film about prizefighting ever made. [24 Nov 1980, p.128]","100","81398"
"20227","Eastwood tells the story at a pace well under the Hollywood speed limit, tosses in details so beguiling they seem about to sprout into motion pictures of their own and bathes his subjects in shadows as lovely as those in any Rembrandt.","100","405159"
"20228","Willard doesn’t try to be great art (although if you really think about it, there are plenty of themes borrowed from “Hamlet,” “The Birds” and “Frankenstein” to name a few). Willard just is.","100","310357"
"20229","Most impressive of all, The Avengers makes superhero movies new again - a colossal task indeed.","100","848228"
"20230","Partly because the movie is so splendidly and completely absorbed in its characters and their milieu, it communicates much more than a quirky appreciation for old books and odd readers.","100","4595882"
"20231","An unqualified winner. Here is a fine dark comedy of flamboyant style and immense though seemingly effortless techniqe...It's an exhilarating original. [21 Aug 1991]","100","101410"
"20232","Oliver Stone's Platoon is the most sobering Vietnam War epic ever made. It is an unqualified triumph for its honesty, its artistry, its brutality and its frank portrayal of a nation - our nation - divided by ideology, poverty, racism and drugs. [25 Jan 1987, p.1E]","100","91763"
"20233","They don't make 'em like this anymore! [13 Nov 1998, p.B2]","100","32138"

"20235","Palm Springs adds meaning to the seeming meaninglessness of life, with infectious fun and introspective pleasure to boot.","100","9484998"
"20236","Precise, lucid and thrillingly disciplined, this story of boundary-testing in the early days of psychoanalysis is brought to vivid life by the outstanding lead performances of Keira Knightley, Viggo Mortensen and Michael Fassbender.","100","1571222"
"20237","Violent, poetic, gripping, thrilling and blackly funny: that’ll be the Coens doing what they do best then. Now with added humanity.","100","477348"
"20238","It's a movie that you feel you're not so much watching on screen as having beamed directly into your skull from some malign, alien planet of horror.","100","364569"
"20239","BlacKkKlansman is both hilarious and exquisitely direct, and had it been made before November 2016, you might call Lee’s approach a little alarmist. But if anything, he’s restrained. This is an angry film as well as a hugely entertaining one, and Lee has complete control over its shifting tone, minute by minute.","100","7349662"
"20240","It boasts a more consistent tone, better special effects (such as villains throwing buses around like paper planes), and even an affecting love story.","100","81573"
"20241","Unlike so many other movies of literary provenance, it is clear from the start that this one is going to be entertainment, not homework. Lee serves up this sweetmeat without fuss, without the super-seriousness of filmmakers awed by their literary material.","100","114388"
"20242","As tough-spirited as fans would hope for - and exciting and thought-provoking in a way few adventure dramas ever are.","100","1392170"
"20243","In acting terms Tom Hulce's shrieking, giggling Wolfie was easily outclassed by F Murray Abraham's brooding Iago-like villain, but Forman's distinctive central European locations, painterly night-time exteriors and period crowd scenes still look terrific.","100","86879"
"20244","From the slam-bang direction to the relentless pace to the not-a-word-wasted dialogue and even the driving synth score, everything else about The Terminator just works.","100","88247"
"20245","The movie, a simple yet immensely pleasurable tale of a little boy and his undead dog, is good enough on its own. If you know the back story, it's even better.","100","1142977"
"20246","Uproarious. Line for line, minute to minute, writer-director Judd Apatow's latest effort is more explosively funny, more frequently, than nearly any other major studio release in recent memory.","100","478311"
"20247","There is nothing sentimental or picturesque about the performances or imagery. The word that best describes both is elemental.","100","978759"
"20248","This is one of the few adaptations that gives a splendid novel the film it deserves.","100","783233"
"20249","What a shrewd achievement for writer-director Henry Selick (""The Nightmare Before Christmas""), to have made a movie that everyone will acclaim as beautiful, when perhaps the most beautiful thing about it is the sheer ugliness of it all.","100","327597"
"20250","A terrific comic-book movie, the most completely satisfying and unsettling one I've ever seen.","100","409459"
"20251","A masterful dissection of social inequality and the psychology of money.","100","6751668"
"20252","Another illuminating performance by Rachel Weisz and a brilliant screenplay by the distinguished British playwright David Hare make Denial one of the most powerful and riveting courtroom dramas ever made.","100","4645330"
"20253","Out of Africa is a great movie to look at, breathtakingly filmed on location. It is a movie with the courage to be about complex, sweeping emotions, and to use the star power of its actors without apology.","100","89755"
"20254","Has the quality of many great films, in that it always seems alive.","100","118749"
"20255","As you watch this enchanting fantasy, feel free to be thrilled or to giggle, as you wish. This time, Happily Ever After lasts 98 minutes. [21 Sept 1987]","100","93779"
"20256","As a demonstration of slighted masculinity being given an inch, taking a mile, and chewing it up with breakneck fury, the film could hardly be more timely or disconcerting. But it understands the ignition point of rage – not just its ugly momentum.","100","6002232"
"20257","mother! is something truly magnificent, the kind of visceral trash-arthouse experience that comes along very rarely, means as much or as little as you decide it does, and spits you out into the daylight dazzled, queasy, delirious, and knock-kneed as a newborn calf.","100","5109784"
"20258","Hathaway carries you on an emotional whirligig that can be horrifying and funny, hopeful and devastating.","100","1084950"
"20259","This is one of the year's best films.","100","338751"
"20260","It's that rare kind of movie that comes along only a handful of times each year -- gut-level entertainment that's oddly profound.","100","250797"
"20261","La La Land is a film you simply never want to stop watching. It has wisdom and joy and sadness and such magic, from the evocative power of music to the transportative power of movies.","100","3783958"
"20262","Steven Spielberg's magnificent new film, Saving Private Ryan, redefines the World War II movie.","100","120815"
"20263","For those of us who think this is the best comedy of 2004, the genius of the movie lies in its relocation.","100","362270"
"20264","The movie itself is a nonstop barrage -- somewhere between a riot and an orgy -- of crude, obnoxious gags and riffs. If you are a connoisseur of sexual, scatological or just plain stupid humor, you will find your appetite satisfied, even glutted.","100","1231587"
"20265","An ordinary drama embellished and in some sense infringed on by genre elements rather than the other way around.","100","1213663"
"20266","Star Wars is the most entertaining sci-fi movie of the decade.","100","76759"
"20267","Succeeds as an action film, character study and metaphor for our own terrorism-obsessed time.","100","468569"
"20268","About as good a movie as you could have hoped for. Really good. Hole-in-one good.","100","278504"
"20269","Few thrillers create as much sheer joy and happiness as Charade, in which Cary Grant spoofs his Alfred Hitchcock persona, Audrey Hepburn exudes her usual magnetic charm, and Paris is as scenic as ever. [18 Jan 2018, p.E4]","100","56923"
"20270","What makes Freddy truly terrifying, and an inspired invention on Craven's part, is that he exists not in the real world but in the shadowy realm of dreams.","100","87800"
"20271","This is one of the best and most important movies of the year.","100","8722346"
"20272","Clooney brings raw intensity to his role; his scenes with McElhone are rooted in a fierce romantic yearning.","100","307479"
"20273","A beautiful, full-hearted celebration of the craft of filmmaking.","100","8291806"
"20274","Grounded by a performance of monumental soul from Gleeson as a tough-minded Irish priest marked for death by one of his parishioners, the film offers a mordantly funny survey of small-town iniquity that morphs, almost imperceptibly, into a deeply felt lament for a fallen world.","100","2234003"
"20275","A quiet movie, shaken from time to time by ripples of emotional turbulence far beneath the surface.","100","335119"
"20276","Even Wong's detractors, who consider him more stylist than auteur, will have a tough time dismissing the extraordinary emotional depth he achieves here.","100","112913"
"20277","Although obviously a stretched and lightly drawn caricature -- the cerebral writer is obsessed with his work, has metaphorical skin problems, can't have sex without weeping, etc. -- Cotard is real. Or as real a representation of an artist as we're likely to get in this biopic age.","100","383028"
"20278","A harrowing story of unthinkable family tragedy that veers into the realm of the supernatural, Hereditary takes its place as a new generation's The Exorcist—for some, it will spin heads even more savagely.","100","7784604"
"20279","Utterly gripping. Aided by two punchy lead turns, an Oscar-worthy script and stunning in-car footage, Howard’s race film delivers top-gear drama. A piston- and heart-pumping triumph.","100","1979320"
"20280","Using a twist on the ingenious premise of ""Fantastic Voyage"" -- miniaturized travel within a human body -- and a pair of very different but equally irresistible leading men, Innerspace is densely inventive and consistently hilarious. [1 July 1987, p.C1]","100","93260"
"20281","By the time Coogler wraps things up, his film manages the difficult trick of looking back with earned nostalgia and standing alone as a genuinely strong dramatic piece.","100","3076658"
"20282","It's Malick's particular genius to make viewers feel like they're seeing the world, with all its beauty and danger, for the first time. [28 Nov. 2007]","100","77405"
"20283","There is one thing that power can’t stand, and that is to be mocked: The social importance of this topical romp should not be underestimated.","100","4686844"
"20284","The Devil's Advocate is a sharp, suspenseful and completely satisfying movie.","100","118971"
"20285","The beauty of Swingers lies in the irony of its title: Despite their lounge-lizard posing, these guys will never really live up to their Rat Pack dreams.","100","117802"
"20286","The actors are supported by the best kind of writerly craft and directorial technique, the kind that refuses to call attention to itself, never gets caught straining for scares or laughs. Popular moviemaking -- elegantly economical, artlessly artful -- doesn't get much better than this.","100","100157"
"20287","Doctor Zhivago is more than a masterful motion picture; it is a life experience.","100","59113"
"20288","In a league with Hollywood's top historical epics, ancient or otherwise. It's stunningly handsome film, with an equally stunning cast and engrossing story.","100","332452"
"20289","A much-maligned and misunderstood classic, this is one of Kubrick's finest movies.","100","66921"
"20290","IT...carried me along from the opening frame, rarely missing a beat.","100","1396484"
"20291","One of the best American films of the year so far.","100","389860"
"20292","There is something special about the production, with its brash, vivid style, indelible performances by movie icons, and bold mixture of violence and comedy, romance and tragedy.","100","61418"
"20293","Featuring a riveting, fully realized, and Oscar-worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix, Joker would work just as well as an engrossing character study without any of its DC Comics trappings; that it just so happens to be a brilliant Batman-universe movie is icing on the Batfan cake. You will likely leave Joker feeling like I did: unsettled and ready to debate the film for years to come.","100","7286456"
"20294","A splendid new movie. [22 Aug 1993, p.3N]","100","108065"
"20295","War is hell, and Patton is one hell of a war picture, perhaps one of the most remarkable of its type ever made.","100","66206"
"20296","A terrific piece of filmmaking. It's taut, believable as it unspools. It's charismatic, with a slow buildup of tension in near-real time that finally explodes into a blast of violence.","100","44706"
"20297","A smart, creepy, violent, funny, and modern vampire movie that benefits from some wonderful performances, a stunning visual texture, and music by Tangerine Dream.","100","93605"
"20298","The film's charm and delight of discovery, plus its sterling international performances, could make it a breakout hit in theaters.","100","1655442"
"20299","Ersatz art of a very high grade, and one of the most enjoyable movies ever made.","100","42192"
"20300","A remarkably vibrant and frank look at one precocious teen’s emerging sexual life — a film with the stuff of life coursing through its veins and sex very much on its brain.","100","3172532"
"20301","Beautiful, romantic and frantically funny. In its brief, often frenetic 85-minute running time it manages to be a riot of entertainment, embracing the best of old-fashioned merriment as well as savvy, up-to-the-minute contemporary humor, thanks in large part to an extraordinary performance by Robin Williams. [25 Nov 1992, p.E1]","100","103639"
"20302","Think ""Catch Me If You Can"" mashed up with ""Brokeback Mountain"" if Mel Brooks directed and you'll get the idea.","100","1045772"
"20303","The details in every scene and the polish and precision of a perfect cast make Boy Erased one of the finest and most unforgettable films of the year.","100","7008872"
"20304","In 2007, Jamie Foxx won Best Actor for his subtle performance as Ray Charles. Boseman exceeds that solid standard. Incarnating James Brown in all his ornery uniqueness, he deserves a Pulitzer, a Nobel and instant election to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.","100","2473602"
"20305","It takes a while for this powerful, funny movie to grab you, but once you get hooked, it feels like you're swimming in a wonderful stream of humanity, bathed in intimacy, romance and, not a little bit, delicious fun. Fried Green Tomatoes is as likely as any film around to carry your heart away and leave you with a wonderful glow. [27 Dec 1991, p.D1]","100","101921"
"20306","I have written elsewhere that love stories seem to be in short supply these days, as they have been in the last decade of American movies. . . . But the hunger for love on the screen is there, and director Spielberg gives it to us in ""E.T.,"" and because the lovers are a little boy and a little creature, we accept it. Of such simple concepts, timeless entertainments are made.","100","83866"
"20307","Kubrick’s film is the most accurate and timeless portrayal of a world facing mutually assured nuclear destruction, and paradoxically accomplishes this feat not through a realistic study but through the blackest surrealism.","100","57012"
"20308","It's a very funny movie, perfectly paced. [15 Apr 1994, p.C1]","100","111127"
"20309","Whether Kundun is a perfect movie or not, it's an important and beautiful one. Scorsese's movie takes us into a world we've rarely seen with this kind of sympathy or detail: a magical-looking society built on Buddhism and centuries of art and tradition.","100","119485"
"20310","One of the most accomplished, influential and enjoyable films of the '70s.","100","73440"
"20311","""His eye is incredibly sharp and amazing, in regard to visceral cinema,"" says Uma Thurman, who has worked with Tarantino on both Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill. ""He's a great storyteller. He's very seductive as a filmmaker.""","100","266697"

"20313","A compelling, adult period thriller, with an Oscar-assured performance from Angelina Jolie.","100","824747"
"20314","Moves from its protagonist's dream state to her memories to her waking present in imperceptible shifts - the effect is disorienting, at first, but ingenious.","100","1441326"
"20315","It's equally endearing as a sweetly funny romance between two likable oddballs and as a low-tech time-travel thriller, and has something profound to say about making the most of the present.","100","1862079"
"20316","It’s a non-stop blast from beginning to end, jam-packed with a wacky irreverence, dazzling state-of-the-art CGI (courtesy of Animal Logic) and a pitch-perfect voice cast headed by Chris Pratt, Elizabeth Banks and Will Ferrell.","100","1490017"
"20317","Citizen Kane is a great motion picture. Great in that it was produced by a man who had never had any motion picture experience; great because he cast it with people who had never faced a camera in a motion picture production before; great in the manner of its story-telling, in both the writing of that story and its unfolding before a camera; great in that its photographic accomplishments are the highlights of motion picture photography to date, and finally great, because technically, it is a few steps ahead of anything that has been made in pictures before.","100","33467"
"20318","A delightfully offbeat reminder of how inventive and witty blockbusters seemed when you were a kid.","100","87363"
"20319","A landmark musical movie -- controversial, mercurial, even cheeky. It's the kind of film that wildly divides audiences and critics -- people tend to either love or hate it. I loved it.","100","203009"
"20320","District 9 proves that genre films, besides being a hell of a lot of fun, can say things you hadn't considered and show stuff you haven't seen.","100","1136608"
"20321","Easily the best thriller of this or any other recent year...It's the film that marks him as a genius, that proves the auteur (or authorial) theory of filmmaking all by itself. It's the movie that shows a distinctive stamp, the movie that could not possibly have been made by anyone else. And most important, Vertigo is immensely entertaining. It has great peformances from its stars, an overtly Wagnerian score from the celebrated Bernard Herrmann and a plot that is almost hopelessly complex. Almost. [23 Dec 1983, p.D1]","100","52357"
"20322","Meticulous care is evident in every aspect of the film. All three actors playing Pi are outstanding.","100","454876"
"20323","Great directors make great movies. And with Dunkirk, Christopher Nolan has made his second masterpiece, thrilling history retold, remembered and relished.","100","5013056"
"20324","As crazy as the design of the world is, Zootopia ends up feeling like a genuine place. There's a vibrancy to it that runs through everything from the pace of the storytelling to the background details of the world in which the story takes place.","100","2948356"
"20325","As for myself, as Leticia rejoined Hank in the last shot of the movie, I was thinking about her as deeply and urgently as about any movie character I can remember.","100","285742"
"20326","The most innovative, intelligent, and visually sumptuous horror film of recent years.","100","87075"
"20327","Droll, pungent, and superbly told, Peggy Sue Got Married is more thana return to form for Francis Coppola. It's a film that reveals a new depth, anew sensitivity and a new sureness of technique for the 47-year-old director,a film that marks Coppola's entry into a rich, mature period.","100","91738"
"20328","The incessant, rhythmic swishing of the chain gang’s scythes burrows into your brain – and then adds Newman’s supernova performance. It’s a gulag melodrama, if such a thing is possible.","100","61512"
"20329","You savor every moment of Jackie Brown. Those who say it is too long have developed cinematic attention deficit disorder. I wanted these characters to live, talk, deceive and scheme for hours and hours.","100","119396"
"20330","Although its computer-generated imagery is impressive, the major surprise of this bright foray into a new kind of animation is how much cleverness has been invested in story and dialogue.","100","114709"
"20331","ParaNorman is a micro-sized masterpiece that wears its heart (and its half-eaten brains) on its sleeve.","100","1623288"
"20332","Badlands is about a landscape as much as the couple fleeing across it. Watching it, you sense that Malick finds his outlaw lovers beautiful and terrible, pathetic and monstrous, funny and overwhelmingly sad. [27 March 1998]","100","69762"
"20333","Eighth Grade is an absolute delight that stings with truth. It’s heartbreaking, heartwarming, and a total charmer.","100","7014006"
"20334","Result is pure-grade art cinema destined primarily for the delectation of Malick partisans and adventurous arthouse-goers.","100","478304"
"20335","Despite borrowing cleverly from the best, It Follows still manages to feel like no other example in recent years - tender, remarkably ingenious and scalp-pricklingly scary.","100","3235888"
"20336","Magnify James Bond's extraordinary physical powers while curbing his sex drive and you have the essence of Superman, a wonderful, chuckling, preposterously exciting fantasy.","100","78346"
"20337","It's essentially a propaganda film, but Eisenstein's stirring (and, for the history of cinema, truly revolutionary) montages of men in action still are uniquely powerful. [04 Jun 1999]","100","15648"
"20338","It's very much an art piece, to be sure, but it feels like a genuine one that, while meditated, speaks fluently and truly for the place, people and culture it so indelibly depicts.","100","2125435"
"20339","Tobe Hooper's 1974 masterpiece took the slasher flick to a freakier, nastier place and even today has the ability to mess with one's mind. Artfully documentarylike and shot under conditions that produced genuinely traumatized performances, the original ""Massacre"" eschews cheap thrills and attacks the psyche.","100","72271"
"20340","A first-rate thriller about arrogance at the top.","100","118548"
"20341","Anomalisa’s existence is a minor miracle on multiple levels, from the Kickstarter campaign that funded it (the credits give “special thanks” to 1,070 names) to the oh-so-delicate way the film creeps up on you, transitioning from a low-key dark night of the soul into something warm, human and surprisingly tender.","100","2401878"
"20342","It's a hilarious comedy made even more successful because so much of the satire seems fresh.","100","1155056"
"20343","Michael Mann’s Thief is one of the most confident directorial debuts of its era, the product of an unprecedented amount of research and preparation.","100","83190"
"20344","The best film of the year? Possibly …","100","1596363"
"20345","This insane masterpiece shows the self-destructive properties of myth making and how they overlap with the downfall of a community damned from the beginning of time.","100","1954470"
"20346","Even as he beguiles us with mystery, Guadagnino recreates Elio’s life-changing summer with such intensity that we might as well be experiencing it first-hand. It’s a rare gift that earns him a place in the pantheon alongside such masters of sensuality as Pedro Amodóvar and François Ozon, while putting “Call Me by Your Name” on par with the best of their work.","100","5726616"
"20347","Director Oliver Stone has fashioned in JFK a riveting, dramatic and disturbing look at one of the great whodunits of history. [20 Dec 1991]","100","102138"
"20348","A tough sit, but it attracts more than repels you. It commands your attention. Once it lands its hooks in you, there's no tearing away.","100","424136"
"20349","You should see Happy Feet--not only because it's stupendous, but also because it features the best dancing you'll see on the screen this year.","100","366548"
"20350","Delightfull time-travel comedy.","100","96928"
"20351","The Double isn't an original idea. It wasn't even in Dostoyevsky's time. But it's a great story. And Ayoade has produced a brilliant copy.","100","1825157"
"20352","The film rises above the level of agitprop by avoiding sloganeering and using the real words of real people to tell its story. Its feminism, too, is real and unforced, with women simply being shown struggling alongside--and when necessary defying--their male counterparts.","100","47443"
"20353","Sensational and accomplished.","100","120681"
"20354","The movie is flawed by implausible psychology and moments of weak acting. But it's more than redeemed by Lee's passionate ideas about America today.","100","307901"
"20355","An engrossing motion picture. Just offbeat enough in story, locale and star teaming of Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn to stimulate the imagination. It is a picture with an unassuming warmth and naturalness that can have a bright boxoffice chance","100","43265"
"20356","In narrative terms, not that much happens, but as for Harry's emotional journey--well, that's nearly epic.","100","373889"
"20357","The focus in James Ponsoldt’s affecting, intelligent drama is a pair of teenagers, and in them is so much complexity and heart that this casually paced gem feels rich in scope. They’re two of the most carefully created figures on screen this year, and yet their normalness takes us by surprise.","100","1714206"
"20358","This over-the-top, ultraviolent, hyperkinetic action thriller pretty much has it all.","100","493464"
"20359","Andrea Yates believed she was possessed by Satan and could save her children by drowning them. Frailty is as chilling.","100","264616"
"20360","If 99 Homes is a scolding look at a society gone astray, it is also a minor masterpiece of suspense, as tightly wound as “Sicario,” Denis Villeneuve’s white-knuckle drug-war thriller, and almost as brutal.","100","2891174"
"20361","A splendid example of how to tackle the daunting duty of turning a beloved work of classic literature into a movie. Neither a radical updating nor a stiff exercise in middlebrow cultural respectability, Mr. Fukunaga's film tells its venerable tale with lively vigor and an astute sense of emotional detail.","100","1229822"
"20362","Sausage Party is ballsy and dumb and brilliant all in one bite.","100","1700841"
"20363","For me personally, It’s one film that can’t be redone for the simple fact, there isn’t a living director that can capture what made this movie work! If you’ve never seen this film, I can’t recommend it highly enough. It’s definitely in my TOP 5 of “All time greatest movies.”","100","80120"
"20364","This production, directed by Michael Hoffman, is like a great night at the theatre--the two performing demons go at each other full tilt and produce scenes of Shakespearean affection, chagrin, and rage.","100","824758"
"20365","More than a high concept stretched to feature length. This is a funny and extremely satisfying comedy, the best in a while.","100","122933"
"20366","It's an allegory about the Vietnam war, a study of American character and a national propensity for violence. Southern Comfort is a masterpiece.","100","83111"
"20367","The End of the Tour is a five-day bender of a talk — a film that illuminates like few others the singular pleasure of shared discovery of one another’s sensibility. In an unassuming way, it’s a glory.","100","3416744"
"20368","In one of the sweetest ironies of the entire film year, Sam Raimi has made an A-movie with the soul of a B-movie classic.","100","120324"
"20369","See this film immediately.","100","1019452"
"20370","The extraordinary quality of White's script and Arteta's direction lifts the meticulously cast actors to the height of their abilities. ""Friends"" star Aniston digs deep but is never showy. Reilly reveals the tenderness, vulnerability and hidden depth that can lurk within a slob, and Nelson has some of the film's most outrageously funny and inspired moments.","100","279113"
"20371","Annihilation is mesmerizing and its awe-inspiring conclusion will leave your mind blown and splattered against the wall. In its final, surreal biopsychological moments the movie goes to an astonishing interstellar gear.","100","2798920"
"20372","It's a poison bonbon tastier than just about anything else out there.","100","465551"
"20373","Gilliam's dystopian epic remains among his best, blending his trademark visual inventiveness with a vicious brand of social satire. Unique and essential.","100","88846"
"20374","Kevin Costner, as Bobby's carpenter brother-in-law, does the finest character acting of his career.","100","1172991"
"20375","A movie that will endure.","100","169547"
"20376","Field achieves so convincing a picture of everday normality that when violence breaks out one feels the same disbelief that one feels when it breaks out in life. [26 Nov 2001, p. 121]","100","247425"
"20377","[Russ] Meyer could never make a psychodrama as sophisticated as Biller has now.","100","3908142"
"20378","This movie is seriously funny, surprisingly funny, not funny in a way that you ever decide to laugh, but funny like you couldn’t keep quiet even if you wanted to. The laughs, as they say, keep coming.","100","3521126"
"20379","As an austere and darkly comic family drama, and a scathing commentary about the kind of world our children are living in, Happy End is stunning cinema","100","5304464"
"20380","A magnificent throwback to an almost vanished era of epic filmmaking by great filmmakers in thrall to their own passions, rather than to the studio bookkeepers.","100","217505"
"20381","It's tantalizing, delectable and randy, a movie of melting eroticism and toothsome humor.","100","241303"
"20382","No, I couldn't be more pleased with what the screenwriter, Steven Kloves, and the director, Mike Newell, have wrought this time.","100","330373"
"20383","She's an Everywoman you can believe in, showcased in the kind of deft comedy of feminine passion - where deep despair meets Wilson Phillips - that a great many people have been waiting for. Now that Wiig and company have built it, will they come?","100","1478338"
"20384","A scrumptiously delightful moviegoing experience.","100","110357"
"20385","Midnight Run has thrills, excellent performances, touching moments, slick plotting, lively dialogue, plenty of laughs, beautiful locations and finely detailed direction. It's an across-the-board success, the best new movie I've seen in years. [20 July 1988]","100","95631"
"20386","It's so rare to be swept away by a presentation of this magnitude. By all means, go.","100","120910"
"20387","Poignant, troubling and altogether splendid new film.","100","1334260"
"20388","Vega’s tough, expressive, subtly anguished performance deserves so much more than political praise. It’s a multi-layered, emotionally polymorphous feat of acting, nurtured with pitch-perfect sensitivity by her director, who maintains complete candor on Marina’s condition without pushing her anywhere she wouldn’t herself go.","100","5639354"
"20389","A wonderful, sentimental western about a bad man who redeems himself.","100","40064"
"20390","Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh create their own sizzle as Rhett Butler and Scarlett O’Hara in a lavish four-hour epic that juxtaposes scenes of jaw-dropping majesty – that aerial shot of the Confederates’ wounded, for example – with moments of elegant intimacy and playful verbal jousting.","100","31381"
"20391","Such a sour, mindlessly inflated experience that seeing it may temporarily put you off historical movies.","100","151137"
"20392","A brilliant, towering picture, The Place Beyond The Pines is a cinematic accomplishment of extraordinary grace and insight.","100","1817273"
"20393","It's the wildest screen comedy in a long time, and also the smartest, the most fearlessly inspired, and the snort-out-loud funniest.","100","1245492"
"20394","Scott’s Alien: Covenant is a mad scientist film – arguably, one of the maddest. It’s grandiose, exhilarating, vertiginously cynical and symphonically perverse.","100","2316204"
"20395","Only Lovers Left Alive is an addictive mood and tone piece, a nocturnal reverie that incidentally celebrates a marriage that has lasted untold centuries.","100","1714915"
"20396","Lohman in particular is effective; I learn to my astonishment that she's 24, but here she plays a 15-year-old with all the tentative love and sudden vulnerability that the role requires, when your dad is a whacko confidence man.","100","325805"
"20397","Charming, spectacular, technically audacious… in short, everything you expect from a Peter Jackson movie. A feeling of familiarity does take hold in places, but this is an epically entertaining first course.","100","903624"
"20398","In the end the joy of the movie is in watching these four very different characters interact.","100","4971344"
"20399","It fascinates in the moment. It's getting from one moment to the next that is tricky. Surely this is one of the most ambitious films ever made.","100","1371111"
"20400","You’ll never look at Shia LaBeouf the same way after seeing Honey Boy, the affecting movie that’s inspired by his own life. If you run into him on the street, you’ll want to give the poor guy a hug.","100","8151874"
"20401","A wonderful movie, sincere and inspired, with four terrific performances and a story that doesn't let up. The picture has the gentle, nourishing quality of a fairy tale that you want to believe, and the unsoftened impact of gut-level entertainment. [13 July 1990, Daily Datebook, p.E1]","100","99653"
"20402","An almost perfect 90-minute hit of confident and inspired comedic commentary.","100","1791682"
"20403","Rendition is valuable and rare. As I wrote from Toronto: ""It is a movie about the theory and practice of two things: torture and personal responsibility. And it is wise about what is right, and what is wrong.""","100","804522"
"20404","Time Bandits is the best children's picture since The Black Stallion, but it is a satiric, inventive, fantastical vacation for the filmgoer of any age: imagine an intelligent Raiders of the Lost Ark with a deeply bitchy sense of humor. [06 Nov 1981]","100","81633"
"20405","It's a tremendously moving drama, filled with heartbreak, humor and, more importantly, humanity.","100","790712"
"20406","The Witches of Eastwick is an uproarious and entirely successful attempt to examine the differences between the sexes by couching the examination in mythological terms. [12 June 1987]","100","94332"
"20407","Tarantino has created another breathtakingly stylish and clever film, a Jacobean western, intimate yet somehow weirdly colossal, once again releasing his own kind of unwholesome crazy-funny-violent nitrous oxide into the cinema auditorium for us all to inhale.","100","3460252"
"20408","Judi Dench can do no wrong, and playing Queen Victoria for the second time in the richly satisfying Victoria and Abdul is an acting lesson par excellence that proves how rapturous it is to watch this great artist do everything right.","100","5816682"
"20409","The chief delight is Kasdan. “Body Heat” was appropriately slick, but “The Big Chill” and “Silverado” too much so. Tourist is edgier - also the work of a genuine craftsman. Frankly, I didn't think Kasdan had it in him. [23 Dec 1988, Life, p.1D]","100","94606"
"20410","Consequently, Ephron is forced to shape and integrate the twin halves of the picture, and she does a splendid job - the intercutting is always fluid and never mechanical. Better yet, the script keeps surprising us, setting up stock situations and then pulling away from a stock treatment.","100","108160"
"20411","It's a scintillating comedy-drama and one of Altman's most richly moving and entertaining pictures.","100","280707"
"20412","This is not a sermon or a homily, but a visualization of the central event in the Christian religion. Take it or leave it.","100","335345"
"20413","This is an engrossing story, told smoothly and well, and Russell Crowe's contribution is enormous.","100","765429"
"20414","It's quite possible that Titanic is one of the greatest romantic epics ever filmed.","100","120338"
"20415","Polanski's directing is marvelously assured and Depp is always fun to watch.","100","142688"
"20416","Loud and ludicrous, The Jerk is a strong contender for the funniest film of all time.","100","79367"
"20417","This film, Hitchcock's first contribution to wartime American propaganda, is as polished and suspenseful as any the great director would make.","100","35279"
"20418","The Corruptor' quickly turns into a good bad-cop drama of fascinating moral complexity.","100","142192"
"20419","This summer's best popcorn flick.","100","1318514"
"20420","It merits being counted as one of the decade’s best and most wildly original animated triumphs and one of this awards season’s most unforgivable snubs.","100","6241872"
"20421","From The Godfather to Heat, the stamp of The Wild Bunch is self-evident. Italian director Carlo Carlei summed up the debt owed to the film and its director when he said, ""There is a chain of inspiration like The Bible... Everything comes from Peckinpah.""","100","65214"
"20422","Red Sparrow is a thoroughly entertaining movie that stays fresh and interesting for all of its two-hours-plus running time. But what kicks it into a higher level is that it’s a terrific vehicle for Jennifer Lawrence, one of the few movie stars who deserves one, who is a film star in the classic sense.","100","2873282"
"20423","This wacky buddy road film... has a brilliant glow of intelligence behind the stupidness. It's easily the funniest movie of the year.","100","109686"
"20424","Overall, the effect is presumably what Eastwood wanted: we are present at a momentous event, not watching a movie.","100","498380"
"20425","A martial-arts movie landmark, as strong in its performances as it is spectacularly novel in its violence.","100","6864046"
"20426","The performances by the young cast, culminating in an exuberant pot-smoking session, followed by a genuinely touching denouement, is classic stuff. And such lines as: ""The chick can't hold her smoke!"" and ""You wouldn't know her, she lives in Canada,"" are still spouted today.","100","88847"
"20427","Offers breathtaking comic-action fantasy….Exhilarating and sharp, it never stops for a second. [9 April 1999, Calendar, p.F-6]","100","139239"
"20428","Like Brokeback Mountain a decade ago, Moonlight is a piece of art that will transform lives long after it leaves theaters.","100","4975722"
"20429","Steve Jobs is a rich and potent document of the times, an expression of both the awe that attends sophisticated new consumer goods and the unease that trails in the wake of their arrival.... Mostly, though, it is a formally audacious, intellectually energized entertainment, a powerful challenge to the lazy conventions of Hollywood storytelling and a feast for connoisseurs of contemporary screen acting.","100","2080374"
"20430","With the names and versatile talents of Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds, supported by lilting melodies, wonderful dancing and some very funny comedy, the show just can't miss being another MGM top-grosser.","100","45152"
"20431","The movie is one continuous, exhausting, exhilarating chase.","100","440963"
"20432","A haunting, beautiful labyrinth that gets inside your bones and stays there.","100","69995"
"20433","The movie is a paean to outsiders and reckless love.","100","67185"
"20434","Gus Van Sant's direction here is supremely confident, fusing witty camerawork, neat editing, and a jazz-oriented score to make Drugstore Cowboy an exhilaratingly bumpy ride.","100","97240"
"20435","Startling is the fact that a film so light on action and heavy on chat can be so achingly funny without having being crafted by a young Woody Allen.","100","98724"
"20436","A beautiful, at times poetic exercise in excess from Brian De Palma.","100","86250"
"20437","Spectacular, star-powered cinema that makes us ask anew what cinema is for. Call it a ""Dark Knight"" of the soul.","100","2562232"
"20438","This installment has achieved a nearly impossible hat trick. It's a movie that is exegetically correct enough to appease the most hard-core buffs, while opening up the final frontier to a whole new generation of fans who have yet to appreciate Star Trek's ineffable combination of sci-fi action, campy humor and yin-yang philosophical tussle between logic and emotion.","100","796366"
"20439","Hell or High Water is a thrillingly good movie — a crackerjack drama of crime, fear, and brotherly love set in a sun-roasted, deceptively sleepy West Texas that feels completely exotic for being so authentic.","100","2582782"
"20440","It's an antidote to complacency. The question is, whom is it trying to wake up?","100","129167"
"20441","It’s a pleasure, all too rare, to watch two splendid actors pitted against each other with equal force such as Sidney Poitier and Rod Steiger in the exceptional murder mystery, In the Heat of the Night. Over the years I remember a few extraordinary cases of this kind - Spencer Tracy and Clark Gable in “San Francisco.” Alec Guinness and Jack Hawkins in “The Prisoner,” Richard Burton and Peter O’Toole in “Becket.”","100","61811"
"20442","Aptly for a film so concerned with time, Button is 13 minutes shy of three hours and just flies by. If this is Fincher selling out, can he sell out more often please?","100","421715"
"20443","A true-life adventure that turns into a one-man disaster movie - and the darker it gets, the more enthralling it becomes.","100","1542344"
"20444","This 70-minute movie is the most startling, breakneck comedy ofthe Marx Brothers' career... Next to Chaplin's ""The Great Dictator"", thisis the purest satire of dictatorship on film. [20 Jan 1996]","100","23969"
"20445","An exhilarating slalom through the wormholes of Christopher Nolan’s vast imagination that is at once a science-geek fever dream and a formidable consideration of what makes us human.","100","816692"
"20446","A singularly enjoyable and moving film.","100","1315981"
"20447","A diminutive and misleading title for such an affecting, often profound film.","100","4501454"
"20448","It comes as a bonus that this romantic comedy is one of the rare pictures of its type that actually is about something -- the double-edged sword of celebrity.","100","125439"
"20449","Carries so much impacted menace and visual narrative gamesmanship that it brought back some of the excitement I felt nearly a decade ago watching Quentin Tarantino's ''Reservoir Dogs.''","100","203119"
"20450","Bucking the lava tide of computer special effects gushing out of Hollywood this season, the makers of Breakdown use old-fashioned ingenuity -- plus a compelling star, a fast- paced mystery and a deadpan villain -- to come up with a sizzler.","100","118771"
"20451","Certainly one of the very best films in each of Donen and Hepburn's careers, this devastatingly lovely remnant of Hollywood's anything-goes Sixties (with a script by Frederic Raphael) tells the story of a marriage by showing a couple over the course of successive trips to the south of France.","100","62407"
"20452","A witty comedy of manners that arcs into poignance, this is a Christmas movie only a Grinch could hate... One of the brightest, bittersweetest fables of this or any-year. [10 Dec 1990, p.87]","100","99487"
"20453","French director Gaspar Noe has kept a pretty low profile since his 2002 drama ""Irreversible"" notorious for its brutal nine-minute anal rape scene. But this epic, psychedelic mindfuck confirms him once again as the cinema's most imaginative nihilist.","100","1191111"
"20454","It’s a tremendous film that was ahead of its time on LGBT issues and, in some ways, is ahead of ours.","100","109045"
"20455","It's nothing less than a miracle that the director, Craig Gillespie, and the writer, Nancy Oliver, have been able to make such an endearing, intelligent and tender comedy from a premise that, in other hands, might sustain a five-minute sketch on TV.","100","805564"
"20456","More than a powerful elegy, 12 Years a Slave is a mesmerizing triumph of art and polemics: McQueen turns a topic rendered distant by history into an experience that, short of living through the terrible era it depicts, makes you feel as if you've been there.","100","2024544"
"20457","Shelton has written the wittiest, busiest screenplay since Moonstruck, and his three stars do their very best screen work. [20 June 1988]","100","94812"
"20458","Almodóvar presents this material in a way that never splits our attention, even as he’s giving us a deluge of sensory and emotional detail. It’s as if he’s internalized the story so completely that he can’t make a gesture — can’t move the camera, can’t shape a moment — without saying something true.","100","4326444"
"20459","It is nearly impossible to look at this brilliantly executed movie without being moved to tears.","100","81283"
"20460","This screen adaptation...is vital because it has the potential to reach marginalized communities. But it also stands as an aching, lyrical, performance-driven masterpiece in its own right, a film so intense and engrossing that movie houses really should screen it with an intermission.","100","2671706"
"20461","Much scarier than fellow possessed child flick The Exorcist, which predated it by three years, The Omen contains some of the most memorable untimely deaths in cinema history.","100","75005"
"20462","This poetic and compassionate drama by Canadian filmmaker Atom Egoyan combines the intricate structure of his earlier movies with an emotional power that raises his remarkable career to a whole new level.","100","120255"
"20463","Sneakily tweaking our fears of terrorism, 10 Cloverfield Lane, though no more than a kissing cousin to its namesake, is smartly chilling and finally spectacular.","100","1179933"
"20464","Crimson Peak's atmosphere crackles with sexual passion and dark secrets. There are a couple of monsters (supernatural and human), but the gigantic emotions are the most terrifying thing onscreen.","100","2554274"
"20465","The genre maestro has his audience in good hands, “good” in this instance meaning both “skilled, capable, expert” and “decent, ethically sound.” He’s assembled a dazzling contraption that, if twisted in just the right way, pops open to reveal a nugget of wisdom crystallized by the cathartic final shot: we only really own what we earn.","100","8946378"
"20466","Awakenings, directed by Penny Marshall, is a curiously engaging, genuinely haunting movie that rises above some dubious handicapped jokes and strange casting decisions to be truly special. [11 Jan 1991, p.5]","100","99077"
"20467","A sweet screenful of quirky chaos.","100","185014"
"20468","Shot and edited by Spielberg and his team in less than six months, The Post is very evidently a strike-while-the-story’s-hot kind of project, and it finds the master filmmaker at his most thrillingly supple and intuitive.","100","6294822"
"20469","A terrifically engrossing war film in which not a single shot is fired, a movie about shaping events rather than being shaped by them.","100","146309"
"20470","With its deft intercutting of place and time, the film creates a powerful sense of mysticism and fate.","100","274558"
"20471","Nichols has said that the idea for the film emerged from a free-floating anxiety that he sensed in the world at large, the feeling that everything we treasure in life could be lost in an instant. That sensation permeates this strikingly original movie - especially its enigmatic mind-fuck of a finale, which will haunt you for several lifetimes.","100","1675192"
"20472","Stone's feisty, intensely personal style of film making is well-known. With Born on the Fourth of July we are treated to a poignant, spirited and captivating - for the broken heartedness of it all - performance by Tom Cruise. [25 Dec 1989, p.E1]","100","96969"
"20473","Jojo Rabbit succeeds even with a high degree of difficulty, given the sensitivities of the subject matter, the emotional undercurrent of a mother’s devotion to her son and the breaking down of artificial walls to let love in. As much as it makes you laugh, Waititi’s must-watch effort is a warm hug of a movie that just so happens to have a lot of important things to say.","100","2584384"
"20474","This is a movie where you WANT to stick around for the credits. The beauty is that you are totally set up for it, and you don't mind one bit. That final sequence ties the movie together in an awesome fashion.","100","1119646"
"20475","The infectious joy of a long childhood summer is brilliantly and boldly brought to life, unfolding, like Baker’s vital last film “Tangerine,” in a vivid present tense.","100","5649144"
"20476","Achieves its exquisite tension--deepening beautifully from a ""Death in Venice"" setup to an imaginative meditation, on art and life, of uncommon sensitivity.","100","120684"
"20477","The main thing that keeps audiences glued throughout its running time is that it's a love story, easily one of the best American love stories of the past year.","100","1385826"
"20478","Ingenious in its simplicity.","100","185937"
"20479","Only the hardest of hearts could fail to enjoy the great 80s action classic, rereleased for its 30th anniversary: with uproarious explosions, deafening shootouts and smart-alec tag lines following the bad guys getting shot.","100","95016"
"20480","He (Aronofsky) has put together a phantasmagoria of self-destructive obsession that is so visually astounding it becomes its own saving grace. Otherwise, we might not be able to bear it.","100","180093"
"20481","With its swift, jaunty rhythms and sharp, off-kilter jokes, Frances Ha is frequently delightful. Ms. Gerwig and Mr. Baumbach are nonetheless defiant partisans in the revolt against the tyranny of likability in popular culture.","100","2347569"
"20482","With its feverish, percussive soundtrack and bravura cinematography, is like a bolt from the blue, chock-full of unexpected delight.","100","272338"
"20483","The movie is grand and immersive. It plugs us into the final months of Lincoln's presidency with a purity that makes us feel transported as though by time machine.","100","443272"
"20484","For the most part it is an effective, disturbing and - a rarity for Haggis - subtle exploration of the stateside war story.","100","478134"
"20485","Delicious with foreboding, a masterly suspense thriller that toys with our anticipation like a well-fed cat.","100","102926"
"20486","Little Shop of Horrors is consistently amusing and churns with non-stop musical momentum, plus a few old-time Disney touches. This time, it's easy being green. [19 Dec 1986, p.79]","100","91419"
"20487","The best-looking, best-scripted and funniest of Smith's pictures, it's also Smith's sharpest.","100","261392"
"20488","Makes everything in the rival Marvel universe look thoroughly silly and childish. Entirely enveloping and at times unnerving in a relevant way one would never have imagined, as a cohesive whole this ranks as the best of Nolan's trio, even if it lacks -- how could it not? -- an element as unique as Heath Ledger's immortal turn in The Dark Knight. It's a blockbuster by any standard.","100","1345836"
"20489","Director Josh Boone does a wonderful job of celebrating the sentimentality without shying away from the tough moments. The pacing, music and editing are all first-rate.","100","2582846"
"20490","It could be the most authentic representation of wilderness life ever put on screen.","100","67411"
"20491","One of the year's best films precisely because it can't be boiled down to a message or synopsis. It's an exercise in style that risks trashiness in search of transcendence, and it's a sizzling celebration of the power of music, the power of images, and the electric, destructive power of the human body.","100","2053425"
"20492","Surgically precise, grimly funny and entirely mesmerizing over the course of its swift 149-minute running time, this taut yet expansive psychological thriller represents an exceptional pairing of filmmaker and material.","100","2267998"
"20493","Ponsoldt, Paul and Winstead make a remarkably effective team for this film's points and purposes, and Smashed burns long after it goes down smoothly.","100","2063781"
"20494","There's a thrilling sense of transcendence that won't let go from the first masterfully constructed frames in Ridley Scott's modern epic of ancient Rome. It's that very rare feeling that you're settling into a movie whose individual elements are so finely attuned they fuse into a singular construct of pure entertainment.","100","172495"
"20495","There’s no denying that Hooper and screenwriter Lucinda Coxon have delivered a cinematic landmark, one whose classical style all but disguises how controversial its subject matter still remains.","100","810819"
"20496","Winslet deserves an Oscar for her amazing performance.","100","976051"
"20497","This is one of the best movies of 2012. With rich performances, a riveting and articulate screenplay, meticulous direction and enough grounded emotional intensity to keep your pulse pounding, Hitchcock grabs you by the lapels like a suspense classic by Hitch himself - a knockout from start to finish.","100","975645"
"20498","A knockout...So feverish is Fight Club...that thermometer contact might make mercury shatter.","100","137523"
"20499","Focusing on the indigenous community of the Pine Ridge reservation, Zhao reimagines the entrenched masculine persona of the cowboy. The result is an entrancing, deeply moving effort, one that is certain to steal the hearts of audiences on its wider release.","100","6217608"
"20500","Stupendously exciting and emotionally engulfing... With probing intelligence and passionate feeling, Cameron has raised the adventure film very close to the level of art.","100","96754"
"20501","One of the best 'New York' movies ever made.","100","72890"
"20502","Prove(s) once again how ingenious, artful and flat-out entertaining animation can be.","100","120363"
"20503","Donald Sutherland is perfectly cast and quietly effective as a man who will not be turned aside, who does not wish misfortune upon himself or his family, but cannot ignore what has happened to the family of his friend.","100","97243"
"20504","The generally faithful script is by Anne Rice herself, the director is ""The Crying Game""'s Neil Jordan, and both seem true to themselves and as true as they can be to artistic and visceral expectations. [11Nov1994 Pg. 01.D]","100","110148"
"20505","This film about the cult of celebrity in America strikes me as a uniquely intelligent ironic masterpiece – though, witty as it is, it isn’t a comedy, despite what the title and the casting of Jerry Lewis might lead you to expect.","100","85794"
"20506","This is unbelievably rich material, and I can say without reservation that Scott Hicks' work deserves the highest recognition. Shine truly does what its name says.","100","117631"
"20507","In a world full of recyclable superheroes and mindless “empowerment” comedies, we’re finally getting a movie about reality. We’re surrounded by surveillance and the threat of violence, and this film asks us to judge the proper balance between liberty and security – and the amount of collateral damage acceptable to maintain the latter.","100","2057392"
"20508","Body Heat is good enough to make film noir play like we hadn't seen it before.","100","82089"
"20509","This is the purest of American narratives, and this, indeed, is one of our finest storytellers.","100","1152836"
"20510","The writing, acting and filmmaking make Hustle & Flow nothing short of amazing.","100","410097"
"20511","Less a conventional biography than a performance film - one that stuns and delights.","100","125664"
"20512","Drive feels like some kind of masterpiece - it's as pure a version of the essentials as you're likely to see.","100","780504"
"20513","Broken Arrow delivers the hippest action fun around. Travolta's ""Dr. Strangelove"" exit will blow you away. Ditto the movie.","100","115759"
"20514","Watching The American President, I felt respect for the craft that went into it: the flawless re-creation of the physical world of the White House, the smart and accurate dialogue, the manipulation of the love story to tug our heartstrings.","100","112346"
"20515","Turns out to be more than simply a near-miracle of filmmaking, however; it is also an astonishing work of art, a historical epic that drifts through one's consciousness like a reverie.","100","318034"
"20516","Transcendence is a bold, beautiful, sometimes confounding flight of futuristic speculation firmly rooted in the potential of today’s technology.","100","2209764"
"20517","A picture that certain Brits and connoisseurs of British colloquial English might call ""a grower"" … more moving and funny the more I think about it.","100","838221"
"20518","These gun-crazy, lust-loopy kids on the run are irresistible in the best crime rush since “GoodFellas.” [10 Sept 1993]","100","108399"
"20519","Brimming with invention and new ideas, and its Hogwarts School seems to expand and deepen before our very eyes into a world large enough to conceal unguessable secrets -- What a glorious movie.","100","295297"
"20520","In its fusion of craft and narrative, My Friend Dahmer is exquisite. In its portrayal of Jeff's agonies, it can be excruciating.","100","2291540"
"20521","The director’s most outwardly accessible movie in ages, Phantom Thread is at once an evocative period drama and a magical fable about lonely, solipsistic people finding solace in their mutual sense of alienation.","100","5776858"
"20522","If there was any doubt Ben Affleck has turned into an exceptional director, his wildly entertaining, pulse-pounding thriller Argo will handily erase those thoughts.","100","1024648"
"20523","Crash seems incredibly prescient, yet rather naive. The film is a stunning document of our alienated civilization, all the more compelling with its dolorous, almost liturgical tones.","100","115964"
"20524","It rates a resounding yes because it doesn't insult our emotional intelligence. [23 Nov 1983]","100","86425"
"20525","The funniest comedy of degeneracy since ""Bad Santa,"" and a career-changer for Aniston and Farrell if they'll only keep following their perverted muses. Horrible Bosses spins hostile work environments into a movie surpassing ""9 to 5"" and ""Office Space"" as the touchstone flick for disenchanted drones.","100","1499658"
"20526","Tight as a drum, glamorous and exquisitely funny, this one should earn them (Coens) enough cash to make five more offbeat minor masterpieces like ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" -- and the Coens deserve that as much as we do.","100","138524"
"20527","The effects are incredible, the action is exciting, the music is great, and Andy Serkis, once again embodying a non-human character through motion-capture technology, remains terrific. But there’s something more here.","100","3450958"
"20528","The effect is Chaplinesque if Chaplin had the latest in gadgetry, because the entire picture is also shot in 3-D that, for once, puts all 3 of the Ds to imaginative use.","100","1323594"
"20529","Few actors on the planet can shift gears as effortlessly as Chastain, who perfectly captures Molly’s chameleon-like ability to adapt to situations and to rationalize her worst behavior.","100","4209788"
"20530","Bridge of Spies has a brassy and justified confidence in its own narrative flair.","100","3682448"
"20531","The thriller that's exciting, cathartic, and powerfully disturbing. Prisoners is that type of movie. It's rooted in 40 years of Hollywood revenge films, yet it also breaks audacious new ground.","100","1392214"
"20532","This is a deeply felt work of art in the form of a big, brassy movie-movie.","100","1375666"
"20533","This taut cautionary tale explores the dark side of American politics. And leaves the viewer to wonder - if anyone's still wondering - is there a bright side?","100","1124035"
"20534","Gravity is about as visceral an experience as you can have in a cinema, it’s a technical marvel, and it’s a blockbuster with heart and soul in spades.","100","1454468"
"20535","The best American movie about women so far this year, and probably the best that will be made this year.","100","1000774"
"20536","The performances are impeccable. Sachs is a master of expressive understatement, and that applies both to the young actors playing the boys — there's not a false moment from either of them — and to the adults.","100","4919484"
"20537","Richly satisfying entertainment the way movies are at their best, when they prod you to think.","100","434409"
"20538","Boyz n the Hood is a knockdown assault on the senses, a joltingly sad story told with power, dignity and humor. No mere studio genre piece preening as social significance because its characters are black, Boyz is straight from the neighborhood — Singleton grew up in South Central — and straight from the heart.","100","101507"
"20539","This is a filmmaker’s film, a fully realized statement that oozes with the assurance and confidence of a hungry visionary who not only knows what he wants to do but how to do it.","100","3315342"
"20540","There may be better examples of cinematic art in 2013, but for a good time at the movies, it's hard to imagine anything beating this action extravaganza, from director Roland Emmerich, about a very Obama-like president.","100","2334879"
"20541","James Dean's ultimate movie, Rebel Without a Cause is both a great teen picture--full of front-seat romance, fast-car thrills, adolescent alienation, nightmare suspense and all the nervy grace director Nicholas Ray could muster--and a perfect memento of the edgier side of the '50s. The sublime supporting cast includes Natalie Wood, Sal Mineo, Dennis Hopper and Jim Backus; together, they create one memorable scene and incandescent moment after another. [03 Jun 2005, p.C8]","100","48545"
"20542","Brilliantly nasty little horror film.","100","1127180"
"20543","In ferociously intense, chillingly brutal scenes, this bravely innovative, kingsized movie (one should be warned that it runs over three hours) enables one to fully understand why this particular war not only destroyed the hopes and dreams of America’s young men, but why it left so many of them permanently shattered and alienated from society.","100","77416"
"20544","The film is a harrowing, painfully honest, sometimes violent journey, astonishingly acted and rendered.","100","56241"
"20545","That Nichols is able to orchestrate this entire journey with steady tension and lyrical imagery is a testament to his storytelling capabilities.","100","1935179"
"20546","Among an excellent cast, Douglas truly is the nexus; he and Stone make this sequel pay off big-time.","100","1027718"
"20547","A sweaty, vital masterpiece that's always one step ahead of its audience.","100","387131"
"20548","It's a superb, thoughtful drama that doesn't claim to be a documentary and shouldn't be judged as such. [22 Dec 1995, p.B]","100","113987"
"20549","Lovely performances, and more superb gags in one minute than most movies manage in 90. It's like drinking champagne.","100","75686"
"20550","So moving, so memorable, so magically produced, it's going to delight millions of movie fans and sweep the Oscars.","100","120689"
"20551","If this were not such great American-vernacular moviemaking -- hilarious yet hypnotic -- one would be tempted to see something Greek in the tragedy that Ed never comprehends.","100","243133"
"20552","A touch too long, yet never slack, at three hours, TWOWS benefits from independent funding, Scorsese’s brass balls and an A-grade cast’s turbulent improvisations to emerge as an epic, boldly broad screwball comedy about the state of America, then and now.","100","993846"
"20553","The Last Samurai is much more fun than a mere history lesson.","100","325710"
"20554","Parker makes an assured feature filmmaking debut, with poetic imagery and powerful narrative.","100","4196450"
"20555","Every line of dialog, every camera angle, every beat is precisely engineered.","100","7074886"
"20556","The Rescuers Down Under, directed by Hendel Butoy and Mike Gabriel, carries its ambitions with an easy grace, expanding the art of animation to fresh ground without losing sight of the silly fun we love cartoons for.","100","100477"
"20557","Remarkably fresh and inventive.","100","365748"
"20558","All sword and sorcery movies are parodies, but Sam Raimi's ""Army of Darkness"" is the best intentional parody that hardware-heavy genre has ever seen, piling conventions from other genres on top of it until the screen seems a multilayered deli delight...Entertaining and ingeniously resourceful, it's a virtuosic comic-strip movie. [19 Feb 1993, p.30]","100","106308"
"20559","Has the sure grip and the unstoppable momentum of a dream – which are qualities, too of great fairly tales and the most memorable pop songs. [16 Nov 1992, p.127]","100","104036"
"20560","Crazy Heart is the real thing, and a real gem.","100","1263670"
"20561","A visionary, thrilling work.","100","1706620"
"20562","Under the Skin is perhaps best viewed as an icy parable of love, sex and loneliness.","100","1441395"
"20563","It’s a singular vision from an uncompromising director that happens to be about one of the most famous women in American history. Jackie is not Oscar bait – it’s great cinema.","100","1619029"
"20564","Nothing more (or less) than an enchanting light comedy of romantic confusion... It's a movie that understands love because it understands pain.","100","1570728"
"20565","For the most part, Rob Marshall’s film hews painstakingly close to the original in style and structure. But it comes to life thanks to its own consummate artistry and rafter-rattling gusto – watching it feels like reliving a classic, rather than merely retreading it.","100","5028340"
"20566","Ghost World resists convenient closures and summaries and some may take issue with its open-endedness. But anything else would have been phony, and Enid would never have stood for it.","100","162346"
"20567","Those familiar with McDonagh’s work will be unsurprised to learn that Three Billboards is a bold and showboating affair, robustly drawn and richly written; a violent carnival of small-town American life. Yet it has a big, beating heart, even a rough-edged compassion for its brawling inhabitants.","100","5027774"
"20568","Visually witty, flawlessly played romantic comedy.","100","1022603"
"20569","21 Grams strives for greatness, and that's precisely what it achieves.","100","315733"
"20570","It resonates with delicacy, passion and restraint, touching the heart in places where cynics fear to go.","100","1967545"
"20571","It's a beautiful machine, thought out and revved up to the last detail, with no other purpose but to delight - and it delights. [24 May 1989, Daily Notebook, p.E1]","100","97576"
"20572","This movie is great in any version...I don't miss what has been cut from the new version. The overall effect is so beautifully wrought, a few details aren't going to bring things crashing down.","100","83658"
"20573","Attack of the Clones celebrates a certain youthful spirit in both moviemaking and movie watching; because it's as much phenomenon as movie, audiences will either ride with or reject it. I was happy to take the ride.","100","121765"
"20574","The patter is always fascinating, and at right angles to the action. [Mamet]'s like a magician who gets you all involved in his story about the King, the Queen and the Jack, while the whole point is that there's a rabbit in your pocket.","100","360009"
"20575","The film also has stunning car chases, choreographed like the dancing in a musical, as the Blues Brothers are pursued throughout Chicago, at one point even tearing through a shopping mall, in their 'Bluesmobile', a retired 1974 Mount Prospect, Illinois Dodge Monaco patrol car.","100","80455"
"20576","With insightful one-liners by the bucketload and a memorable duo in Dreyfuss and Mason, this serves as a joyful reminder of a genre which has long since past its best.","100","76095"
"20577","It’s a great performance from Bridges, and he seems weirdly young in this film, certainly compared to the brilliant craggy oldsters that later became his acting birthright. You can still see the boyish, vulnerable figure that he was in Peter Bogdanovich’s The Last Picture Show. One of a kind. [20th Anniversary]","100","118715"
"20578","Edward Zwick’s Pawn Sacrifice is an enthralling piece of mainstream entertainment that captures the essence of Fischer’s mad genius, perfectly re-creates the tenor of the times AND works as a legit sports movie about the great game of chess.","100","1596345"
"20579","The pleasures are right in your face, beginning with the million-dollar idea of turning NYC into a walled-off prison where criminals run free. Even born-and-raised New Yorkers (of which Carpenter was decidedly not) could smile at that histrionic setup; it’s an outsider’s joke made funny by our willingness to be entertained.","100","82340"
"20580","The film is a sweet, funny and heartfelt look at friendship and strength.","100","4364194"
"20581","A film with a big heart; it's an eccentric dramedy and a crowd pleaser.","100","1606392"
"20582","Leigh is perfectly cast as the game-pod goddess.","100","120907"
"20583","Here is a gripping film with the focus of a Japanese drama, an impenetrable character to equal Alain Delon's in ""Le Samourai,"" by Jean-Pierre Melville.","100","1440728"
"20584","Established Bergman as a director of arresting visual and intellectual power. [6 March 1993]","100","50976"
"20585","This brutal, violently realistic drama, set against the sordid background of the New York waterfront, packs a terrific wallop that results in topflight entertainment.","100","47296"
"20586","Quite possibly the first truly great fact-based movie of the 21st century.","100","1285016"
"20587","This brilliant satire, styled as a murder mystery, is the best insider's view of Hollywood since ""Sunset Boulevard."" [15 Dec 1992, p.A16(E)]","100","105151"
"20588","One of the most exciting movies of this, or any other, year. It's smart, funny, and wonderfully crafted and performed.","100","106677"
"20589","Superbly scripted, the film features wonderful performances from all its major players. Equally brilliant, especially in a film that emphasizes script and character, is the cinematography by Robby Muller, perfectly capturing the notion of ""America."" A final factor in PARIS, TEXAS's success is the remarkably haunting score by blues musician Ry Cooder.","100","87884"
"20590","Thanks to Sam Raimi’s inventive style and Bruce Campbell’s hysterical performance, the horror-comedy genre has grown into a legitimate genre, but Evil Dead 2 will forever be the king.","100","92991"
"20591","M.A.S.H., one of America's funniest bloody films, is also one of its bloodiest funny films.","100","66026"
"20592","As ever, Freeman delivers miracles; he's as good as it gets.","100","171580"
"20593","The style here is so seductive and witty it's hard to pin down. It's like nothing else I've seen by Hill, and at times, it almost reminds me of Jacques Tati crossed with Robert Altman. It's good to get a crime movie more concerned with humor and character than with blood and gore; here's one, as we say, for the whole family.","100","70735"
"20594","The single greatest pleasure of watching this film is seeing great actors reciting Mamet's lines. It's rumored that members of the cast came to the set on days when they weren't scheduled to film so they could watch their fellow stars perform.","100","104348"
"20595","There's no pretending this is a perfect movie. Yet I doubt I could have enjoyed it more if it were. [25 Nov 1992, p.E1]","100","103855"
"20596","A film that might make you cry watching it is just as likely to give you the creeps thinking about it afterward, which is as it should be.","100","212720"
"20597","Technically, it wouldn't be wrong to call Waves a ""teen drama,"" but that generic label doesn't begin to convey the emotional scope of this tender, bruising, exuberant film.","100","8652728"
"20598","Baumbach’s achievement stings. It also has the sureness of tone and direction of a Chekhov story.","100","757361"
"20599","The film benefits most of all from Rees' careful screenplay, which dances that shifting line between fear and emergent hope. One of Alike's poems says it best: ""Even breaking is opening. And I am broken. I am open.""","100","1233334"
"20600","A final word for those of you who just don't care for musicals: The movie's true lyricism is less in its score than in its visual and emotional palette, and in watching Depp rise to the majesty of madness. So give Sweeney Todd a try. Even Victor, when he finally saw it, agreed: it's bloody great.","100","408236"
"20601","Nearly 50 years later, The Naked City‘s Oscar-winning cinematography and editing still have resonance.","100","40636"
"20602","The result is clean, delirious, and, yes, speedy—the best big-vehicle-in-peril movie since Clouzot's ""The Wages of Fear.""","100","111257"
"20603","Mark Perez has written one of the tightest comedy scripts to make it to be the big screen in ages. Game Night, directed by John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein, wastes not a single second of dialogue, gives killer lines to every member of its all-star ensemble, delivers genuinely tense action sequences, and even goes for broke with style.","100","2704998"
"20604","To call Match Point Woody Allen's comeback would be an understatement - it's the most vital return to form for any director since Robert Altman made ""The Player.""","100","416320"
"20605","Alive with the magic of pictures and the mysteries of silence, this is an uncommonly grownup film about children, communication, connection and memory.","100","5208216"
"20606","Because it is a sequel, it's less satisfying than the more idea-driven original, but this is still top-flight kick-ass entertainment","100","103064"
"20607","It's my favorite movie...Chinatown is a complex reminder of how movies were made when filmmakers held the cards - before product placement, marketers, and agents assumed control of the business. Before movies had to be sold to studios on the basis of zippy one-liners. I dare say that the movie wouldn't stand a chance of getting the green light today unless Julia Roberts was interested in playing Jane Gittes. [5 Nov 1999, p.D5]","100","71315"
"20608","And though not all of Lonergan's conceits work on a scene-by-scene basis (an upper-crust womanizer played by Jean Reno skews a bit too close to caricature), the film has a cumulative power-solidified by a devastating opera-house finale-that's staggering. This is frayed-edges filmmaking at its finest.","100","466893"
"20609","Lawrence is back on the big screen, and it simply demands to be seen. Yes, again.","100","56172"
"20610","Makes a term like neo-noir seem like a fatuous catch phrase.","100","165854"
"20611","A sly, smart and very funny caricature of corporate politics and image culture.","100","427944"
"20612","In terms of filmmaking prowess, ""remarkable"" may not do Laszlo Nemes' holocaust drama ""Son of Saul"" justice.","100","3808342"
"20613","Starting with the outrageous and building from there, he ignites a slight love-on-the-run novel, creating a bonfire of a movie that confirms his reputation as the most exciting and innovative filmmaker of his generation.","100","100935"
"20614","A movie that amply delivers on the epic promise of its title, entertaining, enlightening, and emboldening viewers with its deceptively simple premise and execution.","100","169102"
"20615","Stripped of all bravado, Cruise delivers a raw and probably detractor-proof performance. Spielberg does what he did right in creating a novel milieu for ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence,"" but this time the writing is fresher and anything but unwieldy.","100","181689"
"20616","For all its simplicity, this is bold, heartfelt filmmaking. A masterpiece.","100","86423"
"20617","With its spectacular scenery, stupefying effects and epic scope, is a dream come true.","100","120737"
"20618","A less polished director might have become lost and confused along the film’s lengthy running-time. But Payne’s handling is perfect. He never puts a foot wrong, rustling up a picture that is as bright as a button and as sharp as a tack.","100","1389072"
"20619","This is the extraordinary biopic about the fascinating, complex and inspirational example set by genius cosmologist and physicist Stephen Hawking.","100","2980516"
"20620","Anderson, who makes as impressive a directing debut as has been seen in some time, creates a perfectly modulated mystery that doesn't even feel like one. It's a character play, and Hall, Reilly and Paltrow are so convincingly damaged they take on the properties of fine china.","100","119256"
"20621","The Voyage Home is pure, joyful cinema.","100","92007"
"20622","When you watch Wonderland, going back twenty years plus, you think you're in for some paleontological expedition. Yet, thanks to James Cox's considered and adept direction, a cast and script that never cheats the experience or realism of Hollywood's enigmatic underbelly -- the drama of the 1981 Wonderland murders is de-petrified.","100","335563"
"20623","A brutal encounter with mortality told with uncommon humanity, wit and humor.","100","775529"
"20624","It's flat-out comedy all the way, head-spinningly clever (you'll be talking about a sequence set in the Louvre for weeks) and always engaging. For my money, it's the comedy of the year.","100","318155"
"20625","One of the most beautiful of all Stanley Kubrick’s films, originally released in 1975, this slyly savage tale of social climbing in the 18th century is also arguably his funniest.","100","72684"
"20626","One of the best films of the year.","100","2258858"
"20627","That the performances are uniformly outstanding is a tribute to Rob Reiner, who directs with masterly assurance, fusing suspense and character to create a movie that literally vibrates with energy.","100","104257"
"20628","Here is something great and startling -- not necessarily the kind of comforting, consensus-creating film that wins Oscars, but unquestionably a movie that will live in the history of the medium.","100","120863"
"20629","Corey Haim plus Corey Feldman plus Joel Schumacher doesn't seem like a foolproof formula for a good movie, but when the three oft-maligned figures united for 1987's horror-comedy The Lost Boys, the result was briskly entertaining.","100","93437"
"20630","Goldfinger contains more crowd-pleasing moments than any other Bond film, including Oddjob's flying bowler, a laser beam that almost emasculates Bond, the lavishly accessorized Aston Martin DB5, and the bizarre murder of Goldfinger's secretary (Shirley Eaton): she's gilded to death. It also features Shirley Bassey's terrific rendition of the Leslie Bricusse-Anthony Newley title song.","100","58150"
"20631","Blending race-savvy satire with horror to especially potent effect, this bombshell social critique from first-time director Jordan Peele proves positively fearless — which is not at all the same thing as scareless.","100","5052448"
"20632","A savage yet evolved slice of Swedish folk-horror, Ari Aster's hallucinatory follow-up to Hereditary proves him a horror director with no peer.","100","8772262"
"20633","The film is alarmingly dark. It isn’t especially funny, or quirky, or even much in keeping with the spirit of the series. But in its own singular, deeply strange way, Fire Walk With Me is David Lynch’s masterpiece.","100","105665"
"20634","Superb performances by John Wayne, Claire Trevor and Thomas Mitchell -- who won the Oscar for best supporting actor -- make for an authentic classic that has been copied but never equaled. [25 Feb 2008, p.C8]","100","31971"
"20635","A great big beautiful valentine of a movie, an intoxicating romantic comedy set beneath the biggest, brightest Christmas moon you ever saw. It's a monster moon, a Moby Dick of a moon, whose radiance fills the winter sky and every cranny of this joyous love story.","100","93565"
"20636","A technical knockout. [29 June 1987]","100","93058"
"20637","None of the advance hype on Kids can prepare you for the raw, stripped-down reality that Larry Clark captures in his astonishing first film. Nothing can prepare you, because no other film has ever caught the recklessness, sweat and tingly heat of teenage sexuality so effectively.","100","113540"
"20638","Matching Fukunaga's proven storytelling grace with a story truly worth the telling, the result is explosively authentic and yet lyrical, making an utterly inhumane and alien situation both completely real and completely abstract.","100","1365050"
"20639","It's an intelligent, well-written, excellently played movie, with top flight gore/horror effects, perverse humour and a provocatively bleak vision. Also, it has the world's first true zombie hero in Bub, who listens to Beethoven and eats people.","100","88993"

"20650","They're like gods at play, paragons of pure delight, as they mock and feign their way through a universe of mere mortals. To see the movie again is to realize that they were never entirely of this earth and that they never will be.","100","58182"
"20651","It’s a film that can swing between absurdist humor and brutal gut-punch sadness in a way that’s rare and, at times, truly profound.","100","6896536"
"20652","Two things stand out: the extraordinary command of cinematic technique, which alone is nearly enough to keep a connoisseur on the edge of his seat the entire time, and the tremendous portrayals by Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman of two entirely antithetical men","100","1560747"
"20653","Digs up both laughs and chills from timeworn material.","100","120616"

"20655","Nobody ever placed brilliance in the service of silliness quite the way the Python gang did. Monty Python and the Holy Grail is stuffed with both.","100","71853"
"20656","The Help isn't intended to be so much a movie about the ugliness of the era than an optimistic tale of what can spring from that kind of ugliness, about the ability of people to love one another even when they're surrounded by hatred. And on that level, The Help succeeds wonderfully, a warm and sweet song of hope.","100","1454029"
"20657","Doesn't sanitize its tale of African American loss and survival -- the way Steven Spielberg's “The Color Purple'' did -- but delves deeply, heartbreakingly into an American tragedy.","100","120603"

"20659","Del Toro is almost alone in his ability to re-create on screen the wide-eyed exhilaration and disturbing grotesqueness that is the legacy of reading comics on the page.","100","411477"
"20660","Beauty and the Beast creates an air of enchantment from its first moments, one that lingers and builds and takes on qualities of warmth and generosity as it goes along.","100","2771200"
"20661","Roma is by far the most experimental storytelling in a career filled with audacious (and frequently excessive) gimmicks. Here, he tables the showiness of “Children of Men” and “Gravity” in favor of ongoing restraint, creating a fresh kind of intimacy. Like a grand showman working overtime to tone things down, he lures viewers into an apparently straightforward scene, only to catch them off guard with new information.","100","6155172"
"20662","Lonergan is the master of taking a scene that starts off as something familiar, then sending it spinning off in another direction, and then pulling back at just the right moment, as the viewer’s imagination hurtles ahead to fill in the gaps.","100","4034228"
"20663","The strength of her film transcends the soldier’s power to seduce. We’re beguiled, as an audience, by seeing this male animal as he is seen, and for better and worse experienced, by a diverse and dynamic group of females. And by seeing, in the end, how The Beguiled gives new and memorable meaning to the notion of a finishing school.","100","5592248"
"20664","One of the smartest, most inventive movies in memory, it manages to be as endearing as it is provocative.","100","120382"
"20665","The Irishman is a remarkable achievement that proves the best may yet to come from one of the most essential American filmmakers to ever live.","100","1302006"
"20666","Anyone who could read Munro’s original story and think they could make a film of it, and then make a great film, deserves a certain awe.","100","491747"
"20667","After more than 20 features, Paul Schrader has been reborn with First Reformed, an unhurried, furious, deeply agonized look at faith and skepticism that’s as reverent as it is blasphemous.","100","6053438"
"20668","Hurt is brilliant as Merrick, projecting in his anguished eyes and mournful body language a humanity past the makeup that embodies so convincingly the pain of Merrick, the original elephant man, whose rare disease was exploited by the people running a Victorian freak show.","100","80678"
"20669","Savagely witty on backstage life and audaciously edited, Jazz stands alongside Cabaret as the best musical of the last 20 years.","100","78754"
"20670","You may not be able to figure it out, but that's part of the point of this sensually-directed, sensory-laden experiential (and experimental) piece of art that washes over you like a sonorous bath of beguiling visuals, ambient sounds and corporeal textures.","100","2084989"
"20671","Inside Llewyn Davis isn't about someone trying to make it big, but someone just trying to make it, and the Coens celebrate the hard road that can inspire great art.","100","2042568"
"20672","What makes The Fly such a stunning piece of obsessive film making is the way Cronenberg deftly allows us to identify with his monstrous creation. [14 Aug 1986]","100","91064"
"20673","An exhilarating fish story in the perfectly cast comic adventure.","100","266543"
"20674","Only God Forgives will, understandably, have people running for the exits, and running for the hills. It is very violent, but Winding Refn's bizarre infernal creation, an entire created world of fear, really is gripping. Every scene, every frame, is executed with pure formal brilliance.","100","1602613"
"20675","Some of the scenes in the LA art world are a bit broad. But this is a terrifically absorbing thriller with that vodka-kick of pure malice.","100","4550098"
"20676","THE GREAT MUPPET CAPER is Miss Piggy's finest hour. Anyone not yet entranced by the Muppet mystique will be snared by this movie... A delight -- a tribute to the imaginative genius of Jim Henson and his team of Muppet manipulators. [29 June 1981]","100","82474"
"20677","Once in awhile, a movie comes along that is so touching and sincere, without a moment of false emotion or manipulative self-indulgence, that it establishes squatters’ rights and moves into your heart to stay.","100","3741834"
"20678","The spoof that launched a thousand parodies – this is the one that's 100% funny.","100","80339"
"20679","One of the best, funniest, most surprising and likeable American films of the year. [27 Aug 1979]","100","78902"
"20680","The Graduate is a flawlessly acted and produced film. [Review of re-release]","100","61722"
"20681","On purely formal grounds (the ones on which the genre lives or dies), Kent is a natural. She favors crisp compositions and unfussy editing, transforming the banal house itself into a subtle, shadowy threat.","100","2321549"
"20682","Stir of Echoes is much more down and dirty (than ""The Sixth Sense""), and the thrills are more visceral.","100","164181"
"20683","Unapologetically emotional and impeccably made in the classic manner, it tells the kind of potent, many-sided story whose unforeseen complexities can come only courtesy of a life that lived them all.","100","1441953"
"20684","The magical chemistry between Redford and Spacek cannot be overestimated.","100","2837574"
"20685","An enormously entertaining, crowd-pleasing winner from the director whose comedic edge has never been sharper.","100","1045658"
"20686","At every imaginative juncture, the filmmakers (the screenplay is credited to Pixar veteran Molina and Matthew Aldrich) create a richly woven tapestry of comprehensively researched storytelling, fully dimensional characters, clever touches both tender and amusingly macabre, and vivid, beautifully textured visuals.","100","2380307"
"20687","Wilder consistently infused his films with wit and intelligence, offering comedy in his dramas and drama in his comedies. And Stalag 17 is a shining example. [28 Mar 2006, p.E1]","100","46359"
"20688","Myers gives us all of the exaggerated physical schtick of Jim Carrey plus the added bonus of wickedly clever writing that refuses to let you escape.","100","118655"
"20689","It’s some of Keaton’s finest work. It’s also the first great movie I’ve seen in 2017.","100","4276820"
"20690","Littered with clever dialogue, a beautifully constructed narrative, as well as moments that shift between the energizing and sheer terror, there are a slew of endearing qualities worth sifting through.","100","4062536"
"20691","This thriller is so expertly -- and perversely -- poised that audience members may find themselves secretly rooting for the duplicitous Ripley.","100","134119"
"20692","Structured in three beautifully paced, keenly observed acts, Living in Oblivion is that rare picture that leaves you gasping in disappointment at the end - gasping, that is, because it's over and you don't want it to be. [04 Aug 1995, p.05]","100","113677"
"20693","So good it's scary.","100","298130"
"20694","It plays like the work of a filmmaker operating at the highest level of his abilities.","100","97202"
"20695","Langella has always been a cerebral actor, one who never gives away all he's thinking. What comes through in this portrayal is how smart Nixon was, whether he's cunningly probing Frost's weaknesses or pitching himself to TV viewers as an avuncular, misunderstood Cold Warrior.","100","870111"
"20696","It’s a movie that, to put it in terms that the film’s screenwriters might appreciate, is Thor-ly needed.","100","3501632"
"20697","It's one of the best films of the year.","100","209958"
"20698","Michael Cera elevates deadpan to an art, starring as a slacker turned action hero in this wildly inventive comedy that's one of the most vivid and spirited adaptations of a comic book since Spider-Man--and one of the hippest since Ghost World.","100","446029"
"20699","This is one of the funniest movies ever made. To see it now is to understand that. To see it for the first time in 1968, when I did, was to witness audacity so liberating that not even ""There's Something About Mary"" rivals it.","100","63462"
"20700","Amy Heckerling’s portrait of high school/shopping mall life in Southern California is still just about as good as it gets...The panoply of teen types and turmoils is dead-on accurate.","100","83929"
"20701","To say that Eastwood, who directed, has done a first-rate job of adaptation fails to do him justice. What he's brought off is closer to alchemy.","100","112579"
"20702","While it may not be perfect on a technical level, dramatically it’s a blow-your-socks-off triumph. Be moved. Very, very moved.","100","929632"
"20703","Kristin Scott Thomas' performance in I've Loved You So Long is one of a small handful of highlights by which people will remember this year in movies. This is acting at its most exalted.","100","1068649"
"20704","The best sci-fi movie since ""Moon."" The best time-travel yarn since ""12 Monkeys."" And one of the best films of 2012. You'll immediately want to see it again.","100","1276104"
"20705","Raiders of the Lost Ark is, in fact, about as entertaining as a commercial movie can be. What is it? An adventure film that plays like an old-time 12-part serial that you see all at once, instead of Saturday-to-Saturday. It's a modern ""Thief of Baghdad."" It's the kind of movie that first got you excited about movies when you were a kid.","100","82971"
"20706","Co-directors Pete Docter and Ronnie Del Carmen have told a very, very small-scale story when you look at what happens in the actual physical world. But in doing so, they've done something very powerful, because they have paid full respect to just how turbulent and important the inner life of a child can be.","100","2096673"
"20707","So comically fertile and yet so grounded in the reality of its characters that it's really a kind of marvel.","100","1226229"
"20708","The performances are uncommonly fine...Lone Star isn't built to ride trends. It's built to last.","100","116905"
"20709","Hands-down the best movie of the year.","100","175880"
"20710","One of the funniest, smartest, most moving pictures of the year.","100","305206"
"20711","But Turteltaub surprises us. He has the kind of unerring comic touch - easily able to carry his audience from smart dialogue to heart-tugging emotion to something awfully close to slapstick - that should serve the movie world well.","100","114924"
"20712","Third Person is Paul Haggis' best movie, and the one he has been building toward for years.","100","2343793"
"20713","The Karate Kid was one of the nice surprises of 1984 -- an exciting, sweet-tempered, heart-warming story with one of the most interesting friendships in a long time.","100","87538"
"20714","Ignored for a long time, this film is now impossible to ignore. Mitchum is magnetic.","100","48424"
"20715","With its ingenious camera style, keenly dramatic music score, and brash yet indomitable humor, Do the Right Thing is the richest and most thought-provoking portrait of underclass experience that Hollywood has ever given us.","100","97216"
"20716","Maybe it's no mystery how they did it, considering the aggregate comic talent, but this bunch achieves peaks of sublime nuttiness.","100","132347"
"20717","Moviegoers are turned off by depressing topics, yet ""Diving Bell"" supplies something film fans claim they want: pure escapism, the chance to experience extreme sensations virtually none of us will ever have.","100","401383"
"20718","You won't see a brighter, truer affirmation of the All-American messed-up improvisational family than Little Miss Sunshine.","100","449059"
"20719","Steven Spielberg's War of the Worlds is huge and scary, moving and funny--another capper to a career that seems like an unending succession of captivations.","100","407304"
"20720","The thrills in Spike Lee's singularly savvy thriller are in small unexpected moments.","100","454848"
"20721","Will Richard E Grant ever get a better role than bitter thespian Withnail? Has anyone devised a more iconic comic notion than the Camberwell Carrot? Has any screenplay combined so many quotable lines with such tear-jerking pathos or blatant homophobia?","100","94336"
"20722","By allowing viewers to step into the shoes of a wall-climbing Jackie Chan, a parkour-sprinting Daniel Craig or a bullet-spraying Ahnold, it does something that live action has never attempted before. The carnage flies—it’s possible to miss a lot of it. But if action movies are meant to be stunning, Hardcore Henry can proudly take its place among the giants. Even better, it lets you stand with them.","100","3072482"
"20723","It's a scrumptious and dizzy-spirited lark, a what-the-hell-let's-rob-the-casino flick made with so much wit and brains and dazzle and virtuosity that the sheer speed and cleverness of the caper hits you like a shot of pure oxygen.","100","240772"
"20724","Gondry's virtuosity lifts the film far past science fiction into cinematic efflorescence. He shows us, more seductively than other directors have done, how freehand use of film can capture the flashes in our minds that slip between words.","100","338013"
"20725","A hundred well-placed plot breadcrumbs lead us to our perfect ending, but apart from scriptwriting craft Rees gets in some bravura scenes of high tension.","100","2396589"
"20726","The movie succeeds by the smooth efficiency of Fred Zinnemann's lean, intelligent direction, and by the superlative casting.","100","45793"
"20727","Sidney Lumet’s direction is outstanding.","100","74958"
"20728","It'll preach mainly to the choir - lazy thinkers won't attend, despite George Clooney's attachment as director and actor - but maybe it'll wake a few sleepers.","100","433383"
"20729","Yes, Kermit does reprise The Rainbow Connection, surely one of the loveliest movie songs ever and, yes, it still brings tears to your eyes. Happy tears, realizing some marvelous things never change.","100","1204342"
"20730","Lee's incendiary and brilliant new film.","100","215545"
"20731","The alien attack, taking place in several cities at once, is breathtaking...All the same, Independence Day is consistently funny.","100","116629"
"20732","The Driver is a film of types and trends; a cinematic expression of our basest narrative impulses. Directed with remarkable economy, the seasoned Hill keeps everything as tight as possible.","100","77474"
"20733","The little dramas and themes that emerge during the reunion of the film’s far-flung brood become, like a family, more than the sum of its individual parts, and an incredibly satisfying meal of a film.","100","8637428"
"20734","This movie is NEW from the get-go. It could be your first Bond. In fact, it was the first Bond; it was Ian Fleming's first 007 novel, and he was still discovering who the character was.","100","381061"
"20735","A social-realist blockbuster – fired by furious compassion and teeming with sorrow, yet strewn with diamond-shards of beauty, wit and hope.","100","8267604"
"20736","As profound and intelligent as it is moving, and that makes this memorable motion picture one of 1996's best.","100","115956"
"20737","This is Daisy's story, and Hoke's story. It's a beautiful story, filled with warmth and compassion. It was a glorious evening of theater when I saw it, and it's just as glorious on the screen. [12 Jan. 1990, p.3F]","100","97239"
"20738","Greene's wonderful dialogue, often oddly contradictory, adds to that tantalizing sense of imbalance. [5 Aug 1999, p.G3]","100","41959"
"20739","Blessed substance marries beautiful style in a '90s film noir.","100","119488"
"20740","One warning however: James Caan's shoulder hair, when seen on this size screen, may frighten children considerably (you'll at least want to discuss it openly after the show, answering any questions your kids may have in an honest and direct manner).","100","68646"
"20741","This sentimental perennial is a holiday chestnut.","100","38650"
"20742","A 25th anniversary restoration of Giuseppe Tornatore’s ode to moving pictures and puppy love.","100","95765"

"20744","It's not enough to say that Inglourious Basterds is Quentin Tarantino's best movie. It's the first movie of his artistic maturity, the film his talent has been promising for more than 15 years.","100","361748"
"20745","Teen tales don’t get much better than this.","100","69704"
"20746","A beautiful story, told in measured cadences by a master of old-timey narrative compression and expression.","100","253474"
"20747","The Lost City of Z feels like a clear artistic advance for Gray, who proves himself here as one of our finest and most distinctive living filmmakers.","100","1212428"
"20748","It is among the best and most delicately managed films of the year.","100","361127"
"20749","Tatum O’Neal creates a character out of thin air, makes us watch her every moment and literally makes the movie work.","100","70510"
"20750","The movie is never mechanical or emotionally contrived, and at its heart is a guileless, enchanting performance by Tautou.","100","211915"

"20752","It’s a perfect marriage of direction, performances, and writing, the kind of comedy that people eagerly wait for. Its solutions aren’t easy, and its paths unusual, but it’s a love story that completely earns its emotional peaks, and the kind of comedy that makes you wish every single one of them were this great.","100","5462602"
"20753","The result is an instant classic. The material allows Anderson to neutralize the most irritating aspects of his work (the precociousness, the sense of white-bread privilege) and maximize the most endearing (the comic timing, the dollhouse ordering of invented worlds).","100","432283"
"20754","I think what I like best about Light Sleeper -- more than Dafoe's peculiar magic or Schrader's wise, sympathetic writing -- is the fact that it gives you so much to chew on. So many contemporary films seem to evaporate as soon as you walk out of the theater. Light Sleeper resonates. [04 Sep 1992, p.C1]","100","102307"
"20755","It plays like a Marvel superhero movie had Marvel been run by Suge Knight.","100","1398426"
"20756","The extraordinary cast includes John Travolta, Amy Irving, William Katt and Nancy Allen. Mario Tosi did the elegant cinematography.","100","74285"
"20757","In essence, Dark Star has what all great comedy has: a sense of desperation and pathos allied to an abiding humanity which elevates it high above the realm of mere spoof.","100","69945"
"20758","Hands down the funniest movie I've seen all year and also the smartest.","100","1226774"
"20759","A little movie with big truths, a work of such fierce intelligence and emotional honesty that it blows away the competition when it comes to contemporary romantic comedy.","100","118842"
"20760","The new Planet of the Apes is not a remake, and it's not a sequel. It is an amazing display of imagination.","100","133152"
"20761","Look for realism, and you'll find The Cooler disappointing. Look for a far-fetched yarn that's as unpredictable as a throw of the dice, though, and you'll find it engaging fun.","100","318374"
"20762","Mr. Frears is as good with the small touches as he is with the big ones – and that means they're great. [24 Jan 1991, p.A8(E)]","100","99703"
"20763","It is intriguing to wonder what Scorsese saw in the Hong Kong movie that inspired him to make the second remake of his career (after ""Cape Fear""). I think he instantly recognized that this story, at a buried level, brought two sides of his art and psyche into equal focus.","100","407887"
"20764","Astonishes on many levels.","100","390221"
"20765","2012 takes the disaster movie -- once content simply to threaten the Earth with a comet, or blow up the White House -- to its natural conclusion, the literal end of the world.","100","1190080"
"20766","Virtually nonstop exhilaration--a dramatic comedy not quite like any other, and one that sets new standards for Mr. Allen as well as for all American moviemakers. [7 February 1986]","100","91167"
"20767","This movie is one of the most relentlessly nonstop action pictures ever made, with a virtuoso series of climactic sequences that must last an hour and never stop for a second. It's a roller-coaster ride, a visual extravaganza, a technical triumph, and a whole lot of fun.","100","87469"
"20768","The new film is more expansive, more beautiful, funnier, nuttier and — this is the most difficult trick for any comic-book movie to pull off — more touching than the first film.","100","3896198"
"20769","Kaufman's startling Quills gives us an anatomy of fear, images both silken swift and molten hot, scenes that disrupt and inflame the imagination.","100","180073"
"20770","It confronts the relationship between Fonda and Voight with unusual frankness -- and with emotional tenderness and subtlety that is, if anything, even harder to portray.","100","77362"
"20771","Indeed, it is a uniquely dreamlike, lushly romantic, highly erotic and prototypically Coppolaesque version of the story - a movie that does for the vampire genre what ""The Godfather"" did for the gangster saga, and what ""Apocalypse Now"" did for the war movie: raises it to the level of grand opera. [13 Nov 1992, p.5]","100","103874"

"20773","Despite a final, tacked-on helicopter denouement, it remains a gripping, relentless, supercharged slab of fun that knows no bounds - New York is its playground and the sky's the limit.","100","112864"
"20774","The violence of the inter-American drug trade has served as the backdrop for any number of films for more than three decades, but few have been as powerful and superbly made as Sicario.","100","3397884"
"20775","The Equalizer is gripping, mysterious and even sometimes moving, but it’s never pleasant, still less fun. If you decide to go, don’t claim you weren’t warned. If you skip it, you’re missing one of the year’s signal works of superior Hollywood craftsmanship.","100","455944"
"20776","The Good Dinosaur is up there with Toy Story in terms of its technical achievement and for providing an equally heart-touching, emotional tale.","100","1979388"

"20787","As he did with ""The English Patient,"" Minghella has reshaped the novel’s structure, zeroed in on what matters cinematically and dramatically upped the emotional stakes.","100","159365"
"20788","Arriving in the middle of the Reagan 1980s, Repo Man remains one of the few examples of revolt within the system, and it’s no surprise to learn that Cox is fond of John Carpenter’s 1988 cult classic They Live, which also weds genre mayhem to cutting political satire.","100","87995"
"20789","Half-fish, half-fowl and altogether inspired, it is a dazzling mosey through the creeks and canyons of the Coenesque, whose scattershot format and by turns bizarre and macabre sense of humour belies a formal ingenuity and surgical control of tone that keeps the viewer perpetually off-guard.","100","6412452"
"20790","Piece by piece, Assassination Nation lays out and deconstructs the misogynistic assumptions that underpin many of our reactions to the girls’ behaviour.","100","6205872"
"20791","A thoroughly uplifting bit of cinema.","100","1049413"
"20792","Admittedly this is a legal ""Rocky, convincing rather than realistic, witty rather than analytical, but it amounts to a far more effective indictment of the US legal system than ...and justice for all, and is the first courtroom drama in years to recapture the brilliance of the form.","100","84855"

"20795","Sofia Coppola's second movie as a director is more than a breakthrough: it's an insouciant triumph. She conjures a terrifically funny, heartbreakingly sad and swooningly romantic movie from almost nowhere and just makes it look very easy - as well as very modern and very sexy. It is a funky little Brief Encounter for the new century.","100","335266"
"20796","In our wistful estimation, the most delightful comedy-romance in years.","100","47437"
"20797","Epic in scope yet unassuming throughout, Linklater's incredibly involving chronicle marks an unprecedented achievement in fictional storytelling.","100","1065073"

"20799","The last real earthquake to hit cinema was David Lynch's ""Blue Velvet"" -- I'm sure directors throughout the film world felt the earth move beneath their feet and couldn't sleep the night of their first encounter with it back in 1986.

"20800","Sophisticated, funny, and joyously subversive animated bug epic.","100","120587"
"20801","The pure energy and likability of this film make it such a pleasure.","100","3967856"
"20802","In the person of Cameron Diaz, Mary is an island of sanity, good-natured humanity and genuine sweetness in an ocean of anarchy. Without her presence, There's Something About Mary would be merely sophomoric and tasteless.","100","129387"
"20803","An infectious blast of funky jazz played by a terrific cast and a director at the top of their respective games.","100","1800241"
"20804","The movie takes risks that Hollywood isn't even aware of anymore.","100","29947"
"20805","It is a great film about greatness, the story of the horse and the no less brave woman who had faith in him.","100","1028576"
"20806","The empty promise of the American dream is the implicit subject of most of his films, but in Lost in America, they’re the most exquisitely drawn. Failure and pettiness haunt David and Linda, and Brooks finds compelling ways to frame them.","100","89504"
"20807","This is riveting, dizzying stuff from Villeneuve.","100","2543164"
"20808","True to the spirit of the original film, ""Monsters Inc."", and matches its tone. But it never seems content to turn over old ground.","100","1453405"
"20809","What's remarkable about Dallas Buyers Club is its lack of sentimentality. The movie, like its star, is all angles and elbows, earning its emotion through sheer pragmatism.","100","790636"
"20810","Romero’s distinctly Pittsburghian sensibilities can’t be underestimated when explaining Dawn’s appeal; the Monroeville Mall perfectly evokes the feel of a hollow monument standing at the center of a community that couldn’t be bothered to define itself any more distinctively than could be represented by their choice between Florsheim or Kinney’s shoes. The mall, in essence, shoulders the burden of their identity.","100","77402"
"20811","Sophisticated comedies have gone out of fashion, largely because Hollywood finds it easier and more profitable to simply gross out moviegoers. But Please Give has real class -- and for that it deserves our gratitude.","100","878835"
"20812","Succeeds in finding something larger than one man's misery. It turns dark truthfulness into the cinematic sentiment most worth celebrating this season.","100","118564"
"20813","Mirren brings intellect, humor and romance to the role of Elizabeth II.","100","436697"
"20814","Half-factual, half-fanciful and all funny, this labor of love is also unexpectedly touching. [28 September 1994, Life, p.5D]","100","109707"
"20815","Mr. Redford doesn’t look like Dan Rather, but displays the same dedication to — and respect for — journalism that he brought to the role of Bob Woodward in ""All the President’s Men.""","100","3859076"
"20816","Sounder is a story simply told and universally moving. It is one of the most compassionate and truthful of movies, and there's not a level where it doesn't succeed completely.","100","69303"
"20817","This is definitely not your typical Cronenberg. No matter if you either love his cinematic oddities, or if you’re put off by them, watching A History of Violence would prove beneficial. It’s no doubt one of the best films of the year.","100","399146"
"20818","The work of a born filmmaker, able to summon apprehension out of thin air.","100","286106"
"20819","Well, it's not Hellraiser 2, but it's pretty decent. [27 Nov 1992, p.23]","100","104409"
"20820","I can't remember the last time I saw a family animation so visually rich, tightly scripted and charmingly performed which was also built on a sound and progressive message.","100","787474"
"20821","It’s a harrowing, sensitively realized study of cruelty, revenge and post-war retribution that ranks high among films about the cost of war and its continuing damage to humanity.","100","3841424"
"20822","This is a first-rate mystery thriller, full of visual shocks and surprises which are heightened by the melodramatic realism of the production.","100","54215"
"20823","This is an exhilarating picture, the kind that strips away smug complacencies and exposes raw nerves to a bright light. [14 Sep 1990, p.C4]","100","100436"
"20824","Ran is a great, glorious achievement.","100","89881"
"20825","Refusing to make Breivik spectacular, the film pays tribute to process, how Norway gave him precisely what he was entitled to so as not to give him what he wanted – scale, martyrdom, glamour.","100","7280898"
"20826","None of these issues are fully resolved, but just enough ... and that’s what makes On Golden Pond cinema gold.","100","82846"
"20827","For all the flying fists and the hero’s nightmarish predicament, the notions of redemption examined here are plenty deep. Add that to the bone-crunchingly effective technique and flawless lead performance, and you have yourself something very rare: a testosterone-driven narrative that’s about nurturing, rather than destruction. And one that achieves a bleeding-knuckled profundity.","100","4080956"
"20828","You needn't have colorful Italian relatives, like myself, to enjoy this boisterous and warm-hearted film, which sidesteps cliche while embracing the hope and love in loony dysfunctional families everywhere.","100","1174730"
"20829","Poignant, funny and irresistibly charming.","100","3385524"
"20830","Doctor Sleep is a monumental achievement of tension, suspense, forgiveness and sacrifice I’m not soon to forget.","100","5606664"
"20831","The suspense screws up tighter than a drum-head. The characters remain believable; we have a conflict of personalities, not stereotypes. The action coexists seamlessly with the message.","100","107302"
"20832","The Greatest Showman is the feel-good (and feel good about it) movie every holiday season needs. P.T. Barnum is famous for saying there’s a sucker born every minute and he’s still right. For 105 minutes I’m a sucker for his movie, that may not be the greatest show on Earth but close enough.","100","1485796"
"20833","Clean up the language, and this little roach of a movie could play the bottom half of a double bill with Rowan and Martin's “The Maltese Bippy.” [26 March 1999, Life, p.9E]","100","109830"
"20834","Demme here shows off both the mastery of suspense that made ""The Silence of the Lambs"" a classic, and the humane understanding and appreciation of character that not just deepens but energizes this film.","100","368008"
"20835","One of the most skillful, mesmerizing, tense and satisfying time-warp thrillers ever made.","100","186151"
"20836","In a film so ripe with temptations for posturing, exaggeration and satirical overacting, nobody is anything less than natural, unpretentious and funny as hell.","100","1605783"
"20837","A ravishing, romantic lark brimming over with style, intelligence and flashing wit.","100","98635"
"20838","Flight opens with one of the most harrowing in-flight-disaster depictions of all time.","100","1907668"
"20839","It's big, perfectly cast and entertaining in every way, but more than that it feels like a generous public event.","100","1126591"
"20840","While Tarantino's famous fight sequences are grisly, funny and genuinely entertaining, his love scenes are so tender, so fraught, you fear for the safety of your own heart.","100","378194"
"20841","An Officer and a Gentleman is the best movie about love that I've seen in a long time.","100","84434"
"20842","Director Lewis Gilbert effortlessly marshals the intricacies of the plot (a nutty plan by SMERSH to ignite a world war), the exotic Japanese locations, and the extravagancies of having hundreds of ninja warriors abseiling into a huge enemy base unfathomably constructed in the belly of an extinct volcano (quite the engineering feat!).","100","62512"
"20843","Like the eloquent, darkly funny dialogue, the film's characters, setting and cadences draw us into its world, with all its terrors and tenderness. What emerges is a masterpiece of Southern storytelling that draws a sharp line between good and evil.","100","117666"
"20844","Honoring all that was memorable about its forebears while taking the story to new depths of catharsis, Before Midnight stands as a unique and uniquely satisfying entry in what has shaped up to be an outstanding screen trilogy","100","2209418"
"20845","Its relentless, almost hallucinogenic craziness makes it a hard film to engage with, and the viewer drop-off rate when it launches on Netflix later this year will undoubtedly be steep. But as a mad satire of movie-world tumult, and a furious love letter to the business that made and unmade its maker, it could scarcely be improved.","100","69049"
"20846","Mistress America steamrolls through its mesmerizingly dense running time with such joyous violence that its themes only bubble up to the surface in retrospect, the heart of the movie identified like the dental records of a body that’s been burned beyond all recognition.","100","2872462"
"20847","Jerzy Kosinski's modern fable gets a terrific translation to the screen due to his tight screenplay, capable direction by Ashby, and a marvelous performance by Sellers, one unlike any other in his career.","100","78841"
"20848","Dares to present a flat-out heroic president, without the safety net of irony. It succeeds.","100","118571"
"20849","The rare film about the life of an artist that is itself a work of art.","100","810784"
"20850","With his rapid-fire delivery and big heart, Rockwell makes Owen his version of “M*A*S*H”’s Hawkeye Pierce, but the film’s layers of well-observed truths go deeper than that.","100","1727388"
"20851","No Hollywood suit and no diehard fan could have had the foresight to picture something like this, namely because nobody but Wright had any idea what this was supposed to be. This is something that’s been brewing inside his head for over two decades, and that unquestionable dedication, confidence, and passion fuels each and every scene of Baby Driver.","100","3890160"
"20852","Such are the timeless joys of the books (and now the movie), this sparkling absurdity and knack for buckling swash under the worst of circumstances.","100","983193"
"20853","This twisted space opera serves up carcasses in six-digit figures but is foremost a sendup for the ages.","100","120201"
"20854","As sheer moviemaking, it is skilled and knowing, and deserves the highest praaise you can give a horror film: It works.","100","106452"
"20855","So enchanting it takes your breath away.","100","38348"
"20856","The title comes from the memoir by Mariane Pearl, wife of kidnapped Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl. It applies equally to Winterbottom, who has made the rarest movie among this summer's releases: a taut police procedural that examines all sides of an issue and forces us to re-think our own.","100","829459"
"20857","We've seen plenty of sword-and-sandal epics, full of robustly virile men fighting like real men against other men. But we've never seen those hyper-macho mechanics presented with the brutal beauty and thrilling finesse of 300, clearly the best film of 2007 so far.","100","416449"
"20858","It is Mr. Jolson's first picture and as such of great import to the history of the current theatre. In no other way but pictures can his genius be preserved; and in this he is favored with the double preservative of picture and mechanical voice reproduction. The Vitaphone permits him to talk and sing his way through the sentimental mazes of the movie adaptation. He is a good actor; but he is a very great singer of popular songs. In cities where the Vitaphone can be installed and reproduce his voice this picture will eminently repay attendance.","100","18037"
"20859","More an icon than a work of art, CASABLANCA is still thoroughly entertaining romantic melodrama, flawlessly directed, subtly played, lovingly evoking our collective daydreams about lost chances and lost loves and love versus honor; everything about CASABLANCA is just right--it seems to have been filmed under a lucky star.","100","34583"
"20860","Steven Spielberg proves decisively that a special effects-dependent film need not be cold, mechanistic, or simpleminded.","100","75860"
"20861","This is a serious movie overflowing with memorable acting, unforgettable images, searing tragedy, unexpected humor and an eloquent plea for international understanding. And while it's by no stretch of imagination light entertainment, it's fundamentally a more optimistic work than either ""Amores Perros"" or ""21 Grams.""","100","449467"
"20862","This is a movie to love, that touches you in places you never suspected, that shows you that the road less traveled is the road to your dreams.","100","103074"
"20863","Like “The Shining,” there are a number of different ways to interpret Jordan Peele’s excellent new horror movie, Us. Every image seems to be a clue for what’s about to happen or a stand-in for something outside the main story of a family in danger. Peele’s film, which he directed, wrote and produced, will likely reward audiences on multiple viewings, each visit revealing a new secret, showing you something you missed before in a new light.","100","6857112"
"20864","A confluence of perfection in every aspect of the film.","100","467406"
"20865","Part post-apocalyptic Western, part midnight motorcycle flick and part Rocky Horror Picture Show, Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior is, when you add it all up, a nutty, B-movie masterpiece.","100","82694"

"20868","It's a film with jazz in its bones and rhythm to its beats.","100","48281"
"20869","Based on a Cornell Woolrich short story, this is one of Hitchcock's finest moments, full of subtle humor and nasty black turns, not to mention a wonderful score by Franz Waxman and gorgeous cinematography from longtime Hitchcock director of photography Robert Burks.","100","47396"
"20870","In his most painterly film, Spielberg has appropriated the lavish visual palette of John Ford movies: ""The Quiet Man"" for the rural settings, ""The Horse Soldiers"" for the war scenes. Boldly emotional, nakedly heartfelt, War Horse will leave only the stoniest hearts untouched.","100","1568911"
"20871","Brad’s Status remains grounded in reality — it’s gentle, human and unresolved. I loved it, but I don’t think I’ll ever be able to watch it again.","100","5884230"
"20872","Jenkins captures the humor, verve, and considerable complexity of the prose.","100","7125860"
"20873","The movie grabs us from its heart-pounding opening sequence and pulls us inexorably along its trajectory with the grip of the last gruesome act of a Greek tragedy. Its fascination is not what happens but HOW it happens.","100","121766"
"20874","No matter where your political leanings lie, the great thing about The Conspirator is that Mr. Redford is wise enough to let the audience decide what the parallels are. See it, enjoy a ripping good yarn and learn something.","100","968264"
"20875","Jewell is not just a man, but a type, and his story is a warning, not just about the excesses of power, but about our own reflexive assumptions. Paul Walter Hauser gives us the soul of a man that deserved respect even before he did something heroic, but one that people might never have noticed.","100","3513548"
"20876","Fincher has made The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo into an electrifying movie by turning the audience into addicts of the forbidden, looking for the sick and twisted things we can't see.","100","1568346"
"20877","Remarkably funny and entirely convincing, film pulls off the rare accomplishment of being an in-drag comedy which also emerges with three-dimensional characters.","100","84805"
"20878","Granik has no taste for noir archness, opting for a chilly, shot-on-decaying-locations naturalism that feels as lived-in as Lawrence's performance.","100","1399683"
"20879","This lushly photographed, brilliantly acted and wonderfully entertaining movie has its own claims to uniqueness. It's the most thoughtful of the three films, and its climax brings the entire series into sharper focus. [25 Dec 1990, Daily Datebook, p.E1]","100","99674"
"20880","Rousing, stirring, with a great cast: Steve McQueen, James Garner, Richard Attenborough, Charles Bronson, James Coburn. McQueen's performance as ""Cooler King"" Hilts is undoubtedly his most archetypal. [10 May 2013, p.C6]","100","57115"
"20881","Ryan Gosling in a physical action-comedy? Whoever thought of the idea should be crowned genius of the year. With dynamite timing and uproarious gestures, Gosling mines his diverse abilities and becomes a blast in The Nice Guys.","100","3799694"

"20885","Lutz's dialogue is consistently sharp and snappy, and the large cast forms a sparkling ensemble under Junger's adept direction.","100","147800"
"20886","It's unfailingly lively entertainment that doesn't stint on (earned) feeling. Ideas about fear of the unknown, industrial corruption, and the splendours of polymorphity are all taken in stride. The balance tilts towards action and gags, and does them gloriously.","100","198781"
"20887","The finest American Westerns have a characteristic that 3:10 to Yuma shares. In a way that's almost mystical, they suggest a truth beyond the specifics of the tale.","100","381849"
"20888","It is as deeply satisfying as only the yowling, primal trashing of several rental cars and hotel rooms while in the grips of a hopelessly depraved ether jag and several sheets of blotter acid can be... A cinematic masterpiece.","100","120669"
"20889","It’s a breathlessly told movie; both meticulous and frenetic, sweat-soaked and methodical. It will take hold and won’t let you go, and it’s one of the most engaging movies of the year.","100","1535109"
"20890","A brilliantly conceived, boldly executed, cumulatively thrilling fantasy epic that expands the art of film and is sure to be the middle link of one of the movies' greatest trilogies.","100","167261"
"20891","What explosive mischief might they create? That's the premise of Morris' brilliantly incendiary new comedy Four Lions.","100","1341167"
"20892","His (Jonze) obvious affection for, and veneration of, Maurice Sendak's 1963 Caldecott Medal-winning children's book is palpable in his near-perfect live-action adaptation, a dreamy -- and, like Sendak's book, faintly nightmarish -- exploration of one child's tantrum-y side.","100","386117"
"20893","Possesses a stylistic boldness and verisimilitude that is virtually matchless.","100","112641"
"20894","Ferris and his adventures represent a teen's dream of glory: to have, at one's fingertips, the technical skills to sabotage the adult world's machinery of oppression and, at the tip of one's tongue, the perfect squelch for grownups' moralistic blather. [23 June 1986]","100","91042"
"20895","Under its leathery hide is a genuine compulsion to de-romanticize Western gunfighting. Every bullet in this movie matters, and by the end Munny's alcohol-fuelled, satanic purposefulness is shocking: in the climax, even his choice of victims has a crazy excess. [10 Aug 1992, p.70]","100","105695"
"20896","In a movie with the energy of this one, we're exhilarated by the sheer freedom of movement; the violence becomes surrealistic and less important than the movie's underlying energy level.","100","93409"
"20897","In short, A Christmas Story isn't just about Christmas; it's about childhood and it recaptures a time and place with love and wonder. It seems an instant classic, a film that will give pleasure to people not only this Christmas, but for many Christmases to come. [19 Nov 1983, p.1]","100","85334"
"20898","It's a rich, funny, bracing film, one of Boorman's finest.[06 Nov 1987, p.41]","100","93209"
"20899","Unpretentious as it is, Big takes you beyond laughter, to where you live. And there's nothing small about that. [3 Jun 1988, p.1D]","100","94737"
"20900","The Descendants is that rare bird, moving, enlightening, funny and unapologetically human. It's one of the year's best pictures, one to savor and think about.","100","1033575"
"20901","This is an amazing black satire filled with vicious biting words that snap like firecrackers.","100","97493"
"20902","The payoff is a consistently rich piece with impressive visual vitality.","100","120762"
"20903","A grisly, authentic, meticulously researched, pulse-quickening political chiller about a hot-button topic that will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.","100","896872"
"20904","The first 10 or 15 minutes of The Fugitive are so skillfully assembled they should be taught in film school. [6 Aug 1993, p.3E]","100","106977"
"20905","As Soderbergh lovingly peels away veil after veil of deception, the film develops into an unexpected human comedy. Not that any of the characters are laughing.","100","1130080"
"20906","The Birds is here, and what a joy to behold a self-contained movie which does not feed parasitically on outside cultural references—Chekhov, Synge, O’Neill, Genet, Behan, Melville, or what have you. Drawing from the relatively invisible literary talents of Daphne DuMaurier and Evan Hunter, Alfred Hitchcock has fashioned a major work of cinematic art, and cinematic is the operative term here, not literary or sociological.","100","56869"
"20907","A sharp shock of a film in an Awards season very full of movies so noble they become immobile. It's wildly unlikely to get much love from the Academy, and that's fine-bluntly, it's too good for them. With its bloody stew of history and hysteria, action taken from movies and atrocities taken from fact, Django isn't just a movie only America could make-it's also a movie only America needs to.","100","1853728"
"20908","Bigelow's knack for fast-paced action, her skill at evoking a threatening atmosphere and her affinity with damaged people all come together in the daringly kinetic new film. [13 Oct 1995, p.28]","100","114558"
"20909","Made in Dagenham is a retro romp with heart, smarts, soul and wit that will restore your faith in the power of the picket line.","100","1371155"
"20910","Directed by John McTiernan, it’s an ’80s classic full of still-thrilling action, quotable one-liners (“Get to the chopper!” “Stick around!”) and sly digs at Uncle Sam’s penchant for unwinnable jungle wars.","100","93773"
"20911","It's brilliantly acted. But best of all, it's brilliantly made.","100","264464"
"20912","As viscerally compelling as smash-mouth filmmaking gets.","100","463854"
"20913","For two hours I felt like a kitten chasing an elusive ball of catnip that remained just beyond my paw.","100","365737"
"20914","British director Mike Leigh has made the first great comedy for our new depression.","100","1045670"
"20915","But it is the steady accretion of hundreds of small moments in this elegant, high-spirited, intensely satisfying production -- the director's third American movie, but the first to approach the dazzle of his Hong Kong stuff -- that, toted up, makes everything right about this des- perately welcome thriller.","100","119094"
"20916","The Sessions is fascinating, informative, engaging and heartbreaking stuff. Its easygoing, matter-of-fact tone makes it subtle and rewarding, not weird. Roses all around to all and sundry for one of the year's most captivating films.","100","1866249"
"20917","Beautifully wrought, darkly funny and finally devastating, My Own Private Idaho almost single-handedly revives the notion of personal filmmaking in the United States. [18 Oct 1991]","100","102494"
"20918","Michael Dudok de Wit’s hypnotizing, entirely dialogue-free The Red Turtle is a fable so simple, so pure, it feels as if it has existed for hundreds of years, like a brilliant shard of sea glass rendered smooth and elegant through generations of retelling.","100","3666024"
"20919","The Force Awakens is ridiculous and melodramatic and sentimental of course, but exciting and brimming with energy and its own kind of generosity. What a Christmas present.","100","2488496"
"20920","An instant slapstick classic from Disney and Steven Spielberg. Already, it's a hare's breadth away from legend. [22 June 1988]","100","96438"
"20921","Most movies stress the agony of art (think of Kirk Douglas' Van Gogh in ""Lust for Life""). Schnabel's exceptional film honors his friend by showing the act of creation as a natural high.","100","115632"
"20922","Blue Valentine is about real life, warts and all, over narrative conventions like action and plot mechanics. It is brutal, compassionate, beautiful in its ugliness and one of the bravest films of the year.","100","1120985"
"20923","Among the most purely entertaining films of the year, which cuts its laughter with a dose of Celtic melancholy. It still delivers cop/action requirements - shoot-outs, revenges, daring deeds - and chances are, we'll be quoting lines from this forever.","100","1540133"
"20924","I’ve been trying to think when there was a historical drama I found as electrifying as Joe Wright’s Darkest Hour. It may have been Steven Spielberg’s “Munich,” which topped my 10-best list a dozen years ago.","100","4555426"
"20925","Hitchcock called his most familiar subject ""The Innocent Man Wrongly Accused."" Jarecki pumps up the pressure here by giving us a Guilty Man Accurately Accused, and that's what makes the film so ingeniously involving.","100","1764183"
"20926","Writer/director David Mamet, who's built a career in both theater and film by being a hyper-manly sort of writer, has crafted a film that is laugh out loud funny and dinner-conversation smart.","100","120202"
"20927","Might be the most provocative teen sex comedy ever made; it is certainly one of the most convulsively funny.","100","829482"
"20928","Rarely do you find such self-plunging material beyond the realm of documentary or far-fringe museum fare, and despite his background in that arena, Mills sheds all preciosity in service of genuinely revealing introspection.","100","1532503"
"20929","It remains a nightmare experience that’s not easily brushed off. And despite its ramshackle scrappiness in production terms, and some dated gender politics, the storytelling is first class, pitching us straight into the action, but only revealing its full hand gradually.","100","63350"
"20930","The picture goes exactly where the prose does, enticing all of us, kids and adults and atheists and believers alike, down below the brittle surface of our cold logic and into a richer world of imaginative wonder.","100","363771"
"20931","A parable that concerns the monstrous conduct of humans, Tusk is a salute to storytelling, a comic send-up of Canadiana – with awesome references to Degrassi and Duplessis – and a terrorizing vehicle for sharply conceived absurdity.","100","3099498"
"20932","The year's most thrilling, FEELING mainstream movie.","100","1650062"
"20933","Truly great cinema- manages to dodge that 'dodgy sequel' curse with ease.","100","90605"
"20934","A gorgeous piece of work. It pulls every heartstring a good romance should, yet bursts with G-rated fun, wonderfully human characters and several solid and hummable songs.","100","118617"
"20935","A film as rich as a sauce béarnaise, as refreshing as a raspberry sorbet.","100","382932"
"20936","The complexity, richness and fullness of what Leo does here is acting at its most illuminating and useful.","100","4513316"
"20937","While the themes are deep, Black Panther is at the same time a visual joy to behold, with confident quirkiness (those aforementioned war rhinos), insane action sequences and special effects, and the glorious reveal of Wakanda, whose culture is steeped in African influences but which also offers a jaw-dropping look at what a city of the future could be.","100","1825683"
"20938","The result is a peculiar small gem, a true Linklater gem. The verity of the film, rather than any novelty or twist, keeps us fixed.","100","381681"
"20939","The result is a top-drawer melodrama, a polished example of commercial movie-making that manages to improve on the original while retaining its best-selling spirit. [30 Jun 1993 Pg. F1]","100","106918"
"20940","Squid keeps you on your toes, but payoffs will have you smiling - maybe in rueful recognition of the truth - in scene after scene.","100","367089"
"20941","Deliriously charming.","100","414387"
"20942","Either Live Free or Die Hard will go down as the summer's best action blockbuster, or it's going to be one exceptional summer.","100","337978"
"20943","Yes, Locke is a bit of a storytelling stunt: For the entirety of the movie, Ivan is the only character on screen. But even with nothing to cut away to and no flashbacks to offer context, the film manages to stay as tight as a vise.","100","2692904"
"20944","Intoxicating. [19 Dec 1988, p.78]","100","96463"
"20945","Let's say it without equivocation: Colin Firth deserves an Oscar for his lead role in The King's Speech as the stammering King George VI.","100","1504320"
"20946","What Mr. Crowe has done is nonetheless remarkable. He has made a movie about sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll that you would be happy to take your mother to see.","100","181875"
"20947","As challenging as it must have been to pilot Joss Whedon's space opera from the TV junk pile to the big screen, the finished product is a triumph.","100","379786"
"20948","In the end, all the strangeness adds up towards something genuinely significant: an atypically rich and substantial comedy that's stuffed with great scenes and performances even before you start to chew on its bigger questions.","100","3464902"
"20949","A shockingly powerful screed against racism that also manages to be so well performed and directed that it is entertaining as well. [30 October 1998, Friday, p.A]","100","120586"
"20950","Michelle Pfeiffer would easily steal The Fabulous Baker Boys were it not for a hefty payoff on the long overdue teaming of Jeff and Beau Bridges. Then again, the fabulous Bridges boys would steal the picture if not for Pfeiffer. Filmmaker Steve Kloves, who has all but come out of nowhere, must be living right. [13 Oct 1989, p.4D]","100","97322"
"20951","A giddily entertaining homage to female power that illuminates bold ambition in its stars and director alike, Hustlers is the kind of era-defining film that Hollywood didn’t know it needed.","100","5503686"
"20952","The best American film of 2008.","100","959337"
"20953","It's genuinely funny, yet it's also scary, especially for young women: it plays on their paranoid vulnerabilities... Mia Farrow is enchanting in her fragility: she's just about perfect for her role.","100","63522"
"20954","I have to admit, in all its surreal grandiosity, in all its delirious absurdity, there is a huge sugar rush of excitement to this mighty finale, finally interchanging with euphoric emotion and allowing us to say poignant farewells.","100","4154796"
"20955","More than one joke or one idea. It's a thoroughly satisfying comedy --and a respectable space adventure, as well.","100","177789"
"20956","It can hardly be called a children's film, but a masterpiece of feature-film animation for all ages.","100","910970"
"20957","Anyone not romantically inclined going into Shakespeare in Love surely will be by the end.","100","138097"
"20958","No ceremonious life lessons here — Booksmart lives in a euphoric moment of unapologetic youth that knows what it deserves. Cherish it, revisit the time capsule of our boisterously ambitious era endlessly.","100","1489887"
"20959","The most imaginative movie to come along in ages. [18 Oct 1994, p.A14(W)]","100","110912"
"20960","Heat is in the cop-movie pantheon with Akira Kurosawa's ""High and Low,"" and that's as ""right"" as the genre gets.","100","113277"
"20961","Stunningly smart, genuinely disturbing film.","100","247199"
"20962","The film never slips into cheap melodrama, and ultimately offers a remarkable portrait of humanity at its best and worst, not to mention an ideal to which all people should aspire.","100","56592"
"20963","Bloody well done. Hammer finally gave the Dracula legend the treatment it deserved here, entrusting it to the brilliant director of The Curse of Frankenstein, Terence Fisher, who injected glorious life into the familiar material.","100","51554"
"20964","This is unabashedly virtuoso, show-off filmmaking, as cocky as the misguided young men at the film’s center, who, at least for a period, saw their lives as a Hollywood romp in itself.","100","6212478"
"20965","A sweet, deeply personal portrayal of female adolescence that's more attuned to the bonds between best girlfriends than casual flings with boys, writer-director Greta Gerwig’s beautiful Lady Bird flutters with the attractively loose rhythms of youth.","100","4925292"
"20966","No other movie released this year is as much of a filmgoing necessity as Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now Redux.","100","78788"
"20967","It's more than a detailed account of one man's petty vindictiveness in a bygone era. It's about how our hatred can consume us so deeply that we lose sight of everything.","100","1226271"
"20968","[An] utterly beguiling film.","100","25316"
"20969","In this bolder, longer new cut, characters are allowed to finish scenes previously left as DVD extras, effects are creepier, and the theories of ""the Tangent Universe"" are explored in greater depth. Friends and neighbors, this is a Great American Movie.","100","246578"
"20970","British humour at its eclectic best, a deliciously heady mix of dry wit and ribald farce.","100","109831"
"20971","At its heart, Candyman terrifies because of its ideas. It sinks its horrific foundations very much in the real world of poverty and racial alienation.","100","103919"
"20972","An absolute masterpiece in the Disney tradition. [17 Nov 1989, p.11]","100","97757"
"20973","The best war film since ""Saving Private Ryan."" It is violent, harrowing, heartbreaking and unforgettable. And yes, it was directed by Mel Gibson. He deserves a medal, too.","100","2119532"
"20974","Captures the sleazy allure of Manhattan like no other film.","100","51036"
"20975","After the portentous ""No Country for Old Men,"" Joel and Ethan Coen return to their trademark brand of cruel, misanthropic farce, and for dark laughs and hurtling narrative momentum this spy caper is their best work since ""Fargo.""","100","887883"
"20976","This is the downer as an art form, a feelbad film of gargantuan reach and effect, and a brave, horrified commentary on a whole nation.","100","6304162"
"20977","Ostensibly a haunted house story, it manages to traverse a complex world of incipient madness, spectral murder and supernatural visions ...and also makes you jump.","100","81505"
"20978","Bad Times At The El Royale is creepy and mysterious in all the right ways. The tension builds as the non-sequential story allows the pieces to fall into place in mesmerizing fashion.","100","6628394"
"20979","So the script and the performances aren't exactly Oscar material, but it scarcely matters given that the real stars here are the ILM-created dinosaurs, a miracle of modern moviemaking.","100","107290"
"20980","A sharply observant and witty film that plumbs unexpected depths of feeling.","100","114478"
"20981","This is such a beguiling, generous film from Gerwig. There is a lot of love in it.","100","3281548"
"20982","Amid the clamor from outraged purists and Shakespeare spinning in his Stratford-on-Avon, England, grave, you should notice that Luhrmann and his two bright angels have shaken up a 400-year-old play without losing its touching, poetic innocence.","100","117509"
"20983","Uncompromising, intelligent and searing cinema. Along with The Assassination Of Jesse James... and No Country For Old Men, this is the best batch of Western-set dramas in decades. John Huston would have been proud.","100","469494"
"20984","Payback has a completely different spirit from ""L.A. Confidential'' -- more wild, more silly -- but it has the same attention to the fine points of plot and character.","100","120784"
"20985","Broadcast News grows in your memory. It recalls an era when movies were made by, for and with three-dimensional characters you cared about. Let's hope it doesn't take James L. Brooks another four years to make another one. We can't wait that long. [25 Dec 1987, p.53]","100","92699"
"20986","Excellent acting, a stirring screenplay, and crisply intelligent directing make this fact-based movie a great human drama as well as a riveting and revealing look at crucially important social issues.","100","140352"
"20987","One of the all-time great sports movies — primarily because it's one of the all-time great sports stories.","100","453562"
"20988","Naked Gun 33 1/3 is a feast of pointless, shamelessly silly, almost consistently funny gags. Another comic gem. [18 Mar 1994, p.C1]","100","110622"
"20989","Hands down and body parts floating, the most irresistibly sick movie in years is Piranha 3D, which should be retitled Piranha 3D, Double-D and C for all the topless cuties director Alexandre Aja feeds the fish and audience.","100","464154"
"20990","Gruesome stuff — and yet Body Bags moves along with such jaunty, good bad taste that it’s hard not to smile.","100","106449"
"20991","Put this one at the top of your must-see list. Angelina Jolie might not, in my opinion, have yet reached the heights of the acting profession, but with this passionate, inspired, technically awesome and profoundly exciting chronicle of the life of Louie Zamperini, she rises to the top rank of first-class film directors in a male-dominated field overcrowded with hacks.","100","1809398"
"20992","But with 'Jedi,' listen to the creaking, huge metal door that opens and leads the androids C-3PO and R2-D2 to the cave of Jabba the Hutt, where, at the beginning of the film, good-guy space pilot Han Solo is frozen in a carbonite mold like some kind of nouvelle cuisine side dish. It will remind old-time radio listeners of the creaking door of the 'Inner Sanctum' show, and it serves the same purpose. Both are doorways to adventure...And before this portion of the 'Star Wars' saga is history, let us take time to praise the principal performers.","100","86190"
"20993","There is no raunchier, more raucous, filthy and truly crass movie out this summer than Girls Trip – and I loved every minute of it.","100","3564472"
"20994","A dazzling experiment that paid off immensely, this is cinematic pleasure at its purest. One caveat: If they ever make a sequel, we’re taking two stars back.","100","1060277"
"20995","When absurdism feels this wrong, you know it’s being done right.","100","5715874"
"20996","What an extraordinary thrill to leave a movie exhilarated instead of drained, sated instead of empty, rejuvenated instead of depressed. It's a magical experience.","100","1655420"
"20997","Boldly manipulating light and shadow, utilizing drastic camera angles, and introducing Bogart’s Sam Spade, the first-time director’s detective classic defines film noir.","100","33870"
"20998","Eggers has created a film of disturbing horror, absurdist comedy and probing psychodrama which defies the generic boundaries as it breaks through them. The Lighthouse is a saltwater gothic masterpiece.","100","7984734"
"20999","A voluptuary of a film, drunk on primary colors, caressing Penelope Cruz, using the devices of a Hitchcock to distract us with surfaces while the sinister uncoils beneath. As it ravished me, I longed for a freeze frame to allow me to savor a shot.","100","913425"
"21000","Despite Hitch's discomfort at the iron hand of producer David Selznick, it remains one of his best-loved works. [23 Dec 2011, p.C10]","100","32976"
"21001","Poignant without being melodramatic, overflowing with unforced charm, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl holds a unique appeal that's certain to last.","100","2582496"
"21002","Michael Mann , directs with his standard prejudice toward the sheer physical. The result, almost musical, has only a couple recent movie precedents. [25 Sep 1992, p.1D]","100","104691"
"21003","Mr. Wright's Anna Karenina is different. It is risky and ambitious enough to count as an act of artistic hubris, and confident enough to triumph on its own slightly - wonderfully - crazy terms.","100","1781769"
"21004","One of Cronenberg's subtlest, most insinuating pictures, and one of the highlights of the year so far.","100","765443"
"21005","It's impossible to imagine how the action genre would have developed without Akira Kurosawa's watershed 1954 movie Seven Samurai.","100","47478"
"21006","Jolie draws restrained, naturalistic performances from her all-Cambodian cast, particularly young Sareum Srey Moch. There’s a stillness and a stoicism in her portrayal that makes her an unforgettable figure in this unforgettable movie.","100","4882376"
"21007","When it comes to the oft-doomed genre of seafaring adventure, Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World is a spectacular throwback and a great leap forward.","100","311113"
"21008","The movie gradually deepens from odd-couple comedy into Catholic-themed drama, but it remains marvelously funny throughout. Instead of hitting the easy notes of black humor, McDonagh skillfully modulates between broad character laughs and the men's piercing anguish as the story nears its bloody conclusion.","100","780536"
"21009","Here is a film that engaged me on the subject of Christ's dual nature, that caused me to think about the mystery of a being who could be both God and man. I cannot think of another film on a religious subject that has challenged me more fully. The film has offended those whose ideas about God and man it does not reflect. But then, so did Jesus.","100","95497"
"21010","A gorgeous color palette and a tactile sensitivity to the emotions and intelligence of rural people help to create an organic work that integrates brilliant casting, yummy production and costume design, and fine cinematography.","100","3721954"
"21011","Strangers on a Train is not a psychological study, however, but a first-rate thriller with odd little kinks now and then. It proceeds, as Hitchcock's films so often do, with a sense of private scores being settled just out of sight.","100","44079"
"21012","Writer-director Taylor Sheridan’s Wind River is a stark and beautiful and haunting 21st century Western thriller, filled with memorable visuals and poetic dialogue — and scenes of sudden, shocking, brutal violence.","100","5362988"
"21013","What Wiseman’s film boils down to, in many ways, is a much-needed dose of competency porn – a snapshot of government officials trying their very best to do better, and to be better. And that might be the story he’s really telling: a reminder that government, for all of its speed bumps and snags, can work. It can help. The people running it just have to want it to.","100","12094720"
"21014","It's the most intense, unpredictable and thrilling cinematic experience I've had the pleasure to squirm through in ages.","100","435625"
"21015","A thrilling espionage adventure chock full of iconic characters, set pieces and one-liners.","100","57076"
"21016","While a hopelessly awkward-looking Hill provides fish-out-of-water laughs, Pitt gives a genuinely soul-searching performance.","100","1210166"
"21017","Jim Jarmusch’s minimalist meditation on a trio of misfits who wander across the U.S. Shot in crisp black and white, the film is a series of 67 single takes punctuated by moments of black screen.","100","88184"
