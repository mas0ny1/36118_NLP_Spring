You guys want the rest of my power bar?  holding it up.  holding it up No, we got a Nitro bar.  holding it up How 'bout an Energy Booster Bar?  holding it up No, we got a Muscle Triplicator Bar.  Okay, but let me know if you need some carbs. I got a case of 'carbolicious' in the back. But supplements aside, can I get some quality time with you fellas?  We're in between sets. Lay it on.  How long we been friends?  All seven years of high school.  That's right. That's why I got to be real with you now. And I'm not gonna sugar coat it. As a professional trainer, I'm a little worried about your pecs. You guys don't go all the way down. It's called full extension. And I'm not seeing it.  Craig, you're right. We actually had a long talk about that the other night.  I just don't want you to cheat yourselves. I'm sorry I had to come down on you like this, but in a weird way, that's my job.  Hey, that's why we love you and we hate you.  Still friends?  You know it.  I'm glad we had this talk.  Hey, we don't talk, we do. They all nod.     A very fit  stands on a ministage.  Okay, everybody, I'm Shelley. Are you ready to CardioFunk?  O.S. Yeah!  No!... Yes!  Oh, man, you are hilarious. They highfive. .  by Amber.  Okay! Here comes the countdown! Three... two... one!  a line of aerobicizers. Everyone is in synch  except Doug and Steve, who work out chaotically.  ... and kick! Everyone kicks. But, they continue their hyper dance.  ... and reach. Everyone reaches. They continue being out of synch. Suddenly, they stop, put fingers on their necks and stare up at a clock. Simultaneously, they go right back into their manical dance. . Everyone but Doug and Steve stop. People stare at them. They continue in silence, then slowly wind down as they notice people staring.  Alright! Yeah!  Cardiofunk!  Thank you, Shelley! Shelley stares at them. After a few uncomfortable beats.  ... what's up?      Doug and Steve simultaneously put on their sunglasses.  Should we go back to work?  Probably.  What do you want to do?  We shaked it, let's bake it. They walk off.      Guys drive along highway in . Ocean on one side. Steve stares off at the ocean.  Water.  Where?  There. Doug turns.  Right.     We see Steve and Doug, waist up. They have lotion caked up unevenly on themselves.  You know, I told Dad we should put some ferns and some silk banana trees in front of the store. 'Cause then passersby and the like could see 'em and we could attract more customers.  unsure what he just heard Moonwalk that by me again?  I just said I was talking to Dad about the store and...  The store? You're sitting around thinking about the store?  Yeah.  Why?  That's where we work.  exploding That's right. And is that all you want to do with your life? Is that all you think we're capable of doing  Two hot bikini babes walk past them. Guys immediately stop arguing and turn. We       to see the guys full body, for the first time. They're wearing black Gucci Gstring bathing suits. They flex and hold uncomfortable body positions to show off their muscles.  What's up?  Want to go for a swim or what?  strangled, twisting arm unnaturally ... about quarter after... five The girls walk away. The guys stop flexing and resume their argument.   capable of doing with our lives!  Hey, Doug, why are you Mt. St. Helensing on me?  Because I want more for you. I care about you.  That is so sweet of you.  I know. And you deserve better. You deserve to get into the Roxbury.  Doug, there's a list. You have to be like a Richard Grieco type guy.  Steve, we are the Richard Grieco type guys. We should be on that list. We're 'A' club people leading a 'B' club life.  We've been going to 'B' Clubs? Why didn't you ever tell me this?  I didn't want to hurt your feelings. I know how sensitive you are.  'Cause we settle. 'Cause we keep going to all those 'B' clubs ever night They can smell 'B' club on us like barf in a bathroom. From now on, the only club we go to is the Roxbury.  But, how   But, nothing.  We can't   We can. And we will. Because no matter how many lists and roped off areas the big bouncer in the sky throws in front of us, we will get through. You know why?  We're goodlooking?  Very goodlooking. You especially. Now, repeat after me.  'After me.' Sorry. I'm just kidding.  completely serious And it was hysterical. I'm just not laughing to preserve the drama of the previous moment.  Understood. Continue.  Repeat after me. We can get in the Roxbury.  We can get into the Roxbury.  Roxbury! Roxbury! Roxbury! They leap up and down. Two girls walk by. They immediately stop.  What's up?      Mr. Butabi, Mrs. Butabi, Fred Anderson, , Fred's middle America wife, and Emily are having coffee in the living room. Emily is obviously dressed up to attract Steve. .  midconversation ... And then, and I swear this is true, someone came into the store today and thought it was a real plant store.  No? .  I would not kid about that. Doug and Steve burst in, still in their black Gucci G strings, head up the stairs. .  Hello? Doug and Steve turn.  Hey.  What's up? .  The Andersons here. Get dressed and come join us.  Okay.  Steve! Sorry, Dad, we're busy tonight.  I like your bathing suit, Steve.  Thanks Emily.  Steve, again!  I mean, whatever, Emily.  Nice to see you, folks. The guys rush upstairs. Suddenly, we hear  pounding from their room. .  Excuse me a minute. Mr. Butabi goes upstairs.  'S    The guys are picking out their clothes in the closet Mr. Butabi enters and shuts off the . .  If I tell you to do something, you do it. And what is this business of coming in naked. Put on your pants and come down.  Ain't on our 'Things to do' list. Daddyo. Steve and I have something extremely important to do tonight. .  Yes, to come downstairs.  Dad! Doug goes in their bathroom and slams the door. .  Why can I not get through to him?  Dad, Doug is like a fax machine. You just keep putting things in, face down, and you need to have a cover page, because if you don't  people don't know where it's coming from and sometimes you don't get through on the first call. That's why you got a redial button and a memory button because... you know... actually, I never use those buttons. I always screw it up. I don't know. Doug opens the bathroom door.  to Steve Don't try to explain it to him. He'll never understand. .  Oh, I understand. You are going out tonight.  That's right. .  I just don't understand what you're driving. Mr. Butabi takes their keys off the dresser and grabs their cell phones and starts to exit.  Hey! Dad! What are you doing! Mr. Butabi exits.     Emily is standing, singing Memories from Cats. Everyone is listening.  'Memories, all alone in the moonlight...' Fred nods isn't she good to Kamehl, who agrees. Steve and Doug, dressed to kill, stomp down the stairs. Doug turns to Mr. Butabi.  You can take away our phones. You can take away our keys. But, you can't take away our dreams!  That's right. 'Cause we're like sleeping when we have them.  Later much. The guys exit. Steve pauses a moment.  Emily, nice voice.  O.S. Steve! Steve exits.      Mrs. Butabi runs after them, holding old bricksized cell phones. .  Boys! Boys! The guys stop. .  I don't like you going out without a phone. What if something happens? She hands them the cell phones.  Ma, these are embarrassing. .  Take it in case of emergency. She kisses them and walks back in.  Did Ma get lipstick on me?  Yeah, but it looks like you were making out.  Oh, good. In b.g., Mom gets knocked over by Great Danes. No one notices.   .   We see the van driving down the street.     Doug Pulls down sun visor, checks his hair. Tries rear view mirror  still good. Then leans across Steve, who's driving, and looks in the driver's side view mirror  still good.  Steve, how's my hair?  Looks good.  Roxbury good?  You know it. How do I look?  Robust and attractive. I gotta tell you  tonight, I can taste it. Steve doesn't respond and suddenly  the . Doug gets thrown forward.  completely losing it I can't taste it, Doug! I can't! I'm so scared right now I don't know what to do!  calming him down Bro, you're mad cowing on me. Relax.  I'm nervous, man. We've put all this pressure on ourselves to get into the Roxbury, and I don't know if we can deliver!  You gotta take control of yourself.  No, you gotta take control! I am barely hanging on here!... You... Steve starts crying. Doug cradles him.  Whoa... settle down... relax... think puppies and candy canes... easy... Doug notices two girls walking by the van.  What's up?  completely recovered How you doing, little lady? From O.S., a beer  flies  at them and  on the van.  Alright. Maybe later then.  Doug, I see your Roxbury balloon, and I hate to be the one to burst it. I just don't think our names are on that list.  Steve, get real. The bouncer isn't checking a list. He's checking us. Man, I can't believe all this time, that's what you thought.  So, why didn't we ever get in before?  We were kids. We were completely immature.  But that was last night. And now we don't even have our car.  Perfect. Rites of passage. Like that Africa show on P.B.S. When it's time for a boy to become a man, they send him to the jungle with nothing but a spear to hunt the lion The van is our spear and the Roxbury is our lion. And when the hunt is over, we shall be men.  Does the bouncer know about this?  Look, Steve, what really matters is that at the end of the night  when all is said and done and all hotties have been hit upon  if either of us has just one girl's number, just one, then we'll know, for the first time in our lives, we're really worth something.     The guys pull up  get out. Steve tosses Doug the keys. Doug tosses the keys to the valet  who ignores them. Keys fall to the ground. Doug runs over, picks up keys  hands them to the valet. Walks back to Steve.  Storm the castle.  Take no prisoners. Doug and Steve try to walkbop up to the Bouncer. They wave to people who aren't there, trying to act cool, and attempt to walk in. Bouncer stops them.  Hey, my good hombre, remember us from last night?  No.  Doug and Steve Butabi.  You're brothers?  No... Yes!  Works every time. They laugh hysterically.  Now, I remember. You can't come in. A flashy guy walks past them, in , slapping a fifty dollar bill into the Bouncer's hand and entering.  aside to Steve Okay, it's time to play a little softball.  Hello, my good man. How's it going tonight?  Good. You're still not getting in.  Well, that's not what a good friends of mine told me. Maybe you know him? His name is Abraham. Doug drops a five dollar bill on the Bouncer's clipboard. The Bouncer doesn't move.  You don't know him?  How 'bout his two friends? George Washington and... George Washington? Steve drops two onedollar bills. The Bouncer doesn't move.  Let's not forget the other boy in the band, Mr. Hamilton. He's a little lonely, wants to join his buddies.  holds out a ten. He waves it up and down, sideways, drops it, but the Bouncer still doesn't respond.  Wait up, look what we got here... Steve reaches into his pocket, pulls out some change, starts dropping coins.  Mr. Jefferson, Jefferson, Lincoln...  ...Roosevelt, Roosevelt, Roosevelt, Roosevelt, and a commemorative coin  '84 Olympics  what a proud chapter in Angelino history. The Bouncer looks down and turns his clipboard over, dropping all the money to the ground.  guys' reaction...      The van stops and starts as they look out the window.  There's one! Steve stops. They look out.  That's not an A.T.M. That's where you drop off your videos.  Wait, there's one! Steve stops short. They look out.      We see a yellow  into the back of the flower van.      The guys are thrown forward. All the plants are thrown on top of them.      Richard Grieco is driving the other car,  with him.  Oh, shit! The car.  Car? What about me?  No, this car is illegal. All I need is a police report.  What do you mean?  It's a racing car. I imported it illegally. The guys slowly get out of their van, dazed, dragging plants as they get out.  You okay?  Let me see... Doug slowly bops his head, feeling if there's anything loose.  Ah, great. They're starting in with the neck injuries. I'm screwed. Both guys check if their heads still work. Grieco comes over.  Hey, sorry about your car.  No way. Richard Grieco!  Remember, we saw you last night? Grieco nods, unsure, but agreeable.  To Richard Like Walt Disney says, my man, 'It's a small world after it all.'  So, are you guys alright?  My neck hurts.  re cars Right, so, what do you want to do?  We were just going to the Roxbury again.  But we couldn't get in.  Hey, you guys want me to get you in the Roxbury?  Yeah!  Great. Follow me. Grieco goes back to his car.  This is amazing.  See? It all comes from within. And he felt it. Because he's an actor and he's very sensitive. The guys get back in the van.   Put in 'D' and blast me. Steve shoots Binaca spray into Doug's mouth and shifts. 'S   Grieco is driving.  We got to make a stop at the Roxbury.  What about the party?  I don't want a lawsuit, okay?      Richard Grieco walks with the Blonde Model, Steve and Doug trailing behind, walking past a huge line of club goers. Steve starts breathing heavy  he's nervous.  Steve, keep it together. Think FRA. Focus, rhythm, attitude.  Got it... Fra. They all reach the entrance.  Mr. Grieco. Nice to see you.  I got two.  to Bouncer That's right. We're with Richard Grieco.  to line of people That's right. Grieco!      Red velvet curtains. Steve and Doug push through the curtains and are stunned. 'S  Beautiful, sexy, expensively dressed people mill around.  Oh my God, Doug, this is the most amazing place I've ever been.  Hey guys! This is the coat room. The club's in here. The guys follow Grieco.     The guys enter with Grieco. . Long, crowded bar, oddshaped velvet couches, model types are Velcroed to the walls, huge crowded dance floor. This is it.  stunned ...Sweet. The guys follow Grieco, greeting passing women.  Whats' up?  What's up?... faster What's up, what's up, whats' up, what's up, what's up...  Steve! Get a hold of yourself.  Sorry, it's hottie overload in here.  Pace yourself.  counting to himself ... What's up?... two, three... What's up? . , the club owner, 45, Armani suit, magnanimously greets them, holding a drink  he speaks with a foreign accent. .  Richard, my man! Good to see you.  Benny. Place is kickin'. .  Actually, it's jumping. Like '21 Jump Street,' right? Ha! to Steve and Doug My children watch the reruns on T.V. land. to Grieco Who are your friends?  Oh, guys, this is Mr. Zadir. He owns this place. These are uh..  Doug Butabi.  Steve Butabi. .  Let me show you my V.I.P. table. They follow Zadir through the crowd. As they walk...  aside to Steve Oh my God! The owner.  I know!  He's the man who pulls the strings. The Gepetto of party.  Plus, he's the owner.  Sh! Listen and learn, my friend. They arrive at a table overlooking the dance floor. .  waving to someone O.S. Yes! I see you! Excuse me, I have to say hello to Bob Saget. Mr. Zadir exits.  So, you guys come here a lot?  Yeah, all the time.  But, we're never been inside. Grieco and his date look at each other.  aside Steve, what are you saying, be cool. to Grieco So, is Johnny Depp meeting you here or what?  No. So you guys look like you really know how to party.  Oh, yeah, we never stop.  We're pretty much out of control. Mr. Zadir returns, shouting behind him. .  to Bob O.S. I get it, Bob, the club is crowded, so it's a 'Full House' like your show. to Richard He's too much. Grieco and his date start to get up.  Benny, we'll see you at the party. I'll see you guys.  See ya. Richard Grieco!  To Blonde Their necks looked alright, right? Grieco and Blonde exit. A waiter puts a bottle of champagne on the table and Zadir begins to pour glasses  he's obviously had a few.  Sir, I just want to say, and I mean this with the utmost sincerity, it is an honor to shoot the shit with the owner of the club of all clubs.  Yeah, and we're proficient club hoppers  so we know what we're talking about. .  Thank you.  I mean, we usually go this place called 'The Palace' and that place is rank. The music is ancient.  Yeah, no celeb citings and the women are oinkers.  And they let any asswad in the door. It's the worst. .  I own that place also.  Yeah, but it's a really good location.  And the drinks are reasonably priced. .  No, no. You are right. That's what's wrong with this club business. One day you are hot next day you are not. People get bored easily.  Well, you know I had this great idea. You should make this place like a tropical jungle.  Yeah, lots of silk plants and vines.  Yeah, but they're not real vines. They're bungee cords and people could like swing from one end to the other so if you left your friends at the bar, you could get back to them. Mr. Zadir is half listening to them as he drinks.  Yeah, and the barmaids could wear loincloths  but tasteful. Like the ones they wear in strip clubs. .  You could not insure bungee cords. People jumping back and forth. Too expensive.  Okay. Hit delete on that one. Doug, tell him about your street idea.  I was just thinking, you know how people get bummed waiting outside to get in the club. Zadir nods, listening to this one.  This is good. You're gonna love this.  Well, you make the outside of the club look like the inside. You know, you put down a rug outside and some couches and pipe out some music. People will love it. But, then on the inside.  Oh, this is the good part.  ... Looks like the street. You know, you park some cars inside, a mailbox, street signs, and that way when they come in, it's like the outside is the inside and inside is the outside.  Doesn't that blow your mind? .  It hurts my brain to think about it.   and , predatory model types, scope out the place.  What about that guy?  He owns a restaurant.  How many?  One.  Uch. How'd he get in?  annoyed ... Look, I don't see anything over six figures... So, let's just go. Vivica stabs out her cigarette, begins to pack up.  Wait a second. That's that Zadir guy. Vivica looks up. .  laughing and drinking champagne.  and  Too bad he's married. He owns all the clubs in town. Plus, dry cleaners, that beeper service, and Mailboxes, Etc...  Who are those guys with him? Cambi reaches into her purse and pulls out Money magazine's richest people issue.  I can't find them, but if they're with Zadir, they've got to be worth something.  Great. Let's work.  The guys are pitching Zadir another idea,  comes over.  Oh my God! Benny! Benny! Benny! Benny! .  Gilbert Gottfried, who let you in?  You have to say hello to my friend at the other table. Not this table. No. No. The other one. Looks like this table  other people around it. I have a friends and he needs you to say hello to him at the other table. .  You have a friend?  Oh my God! You got me! I didn't see it coming. No. It was coming but I was not able to see it. .  I better go before he explodes. Gilbert and Zadir walk away.  nervous Was I too pushy? I was too pushy. Did I speak well?  You were totally articulate.  Maybe he didn't like our ideas. It's hard to pitch in a night club. You ever notice, the music is blasting in here. We should try to get a meeting. Steve starts looking off at something, mesmerized.  So, Steve, what if we... Doug sees what Steve is watching. He also becomes mesmerized.  In , like two cars, the girls saunter across the dance floor, toward Steve and Doug.  and  even more mesmerized.  even closer.  still staring at the girls. The girls walk up to them.  on automatic Up what's? You want to dance?  Yes.  Steve, she said 'Yes.'  What?  amazed Hotties want to shake it, come on.  Steve and Doug surround the girls and frenetically gyrate, pushing into them. The girls escape and Steve and Doug end up slam dancing against each other.  Hey, guys! Over here. Cambi takes Doug's hand. Vivica grabs Steve's hand. This is Your Night by  starts. The following is a perfectly choreographed dance to the music. The girls dance seductively, dancing toward the boys. Doug and Steve, unsure what's going on, look at each other. Simultaneously, the girls start to mimic the girls' moves. The boys do some hand jive, the girls match them perfectly. They begin a variety of dips, swings and techno style dances. They're incredible. The crowd watches them... Doug and Steve start doing some moves together. An impressed  comes over to them. John adds his own movements and the guys follow suit. John, Steve, Doug, and the girls do a synchronized dance. . Crowd cheers.  to Travolta Bro, you are incredible!  Seriously, unbelievable stuff out there. So, you want to hang out?  No. Travolta starts to exit.  Alright, catch you later then.  I don't think so.      Mr. Zadir's black limo is driving.     Doug, Steve, Mr. Zadir, Vivica and Cambi are inside. Zadir pops open a bottle of Dom Perignon and starts pouring.  Wow, 1980, good year!  Oh, '80 was an excellent year. Devo had a big hit that year.  Yeah, and 'Joanie loves Chachie' started that year.  That was just a cheap spinoff.  That was a spinoff?  Of course, those characters originated on 'Happy Days.'  I did not know that.  Sure, 'Joanie Loves Chachi.' But, does Chachi give a Fuck about Joanie? .  Cambi makes a good po But tonight we should have fun, not dwell on Scott Baio.  drinking Sweet suds, Mr. Zadir.  Dom Perignon's good but you know what really makes a party  Redi Whip.  But not like when you put it on stuff. It's when you're half pressing on that little white nozzle and like before it comes out, you suck on it, and it's really fun.  You mean like nitrous oxide? Whippets?  taken aback ... No!  dumbfounded Tscha! What is that? Mr. Zadir lowers the panel between the driver and the rear. .  to driver Dooey! We must stop and get Redi Whip! , 35, black suit and tie, looks in a rearview mirror .  Yes, sir. Zadir raises the panel.  to Dooey But it has to be Redi Whip in a can! .  Wait, he can't hear you. Zaidir lowers the panel, nods to Steve.  I was just saying it has to be Redi Whip in a can.  annoyed Right. Zadir raises the panel.  He really can't hear us? .  No.  Dooey, tell your mother I had a really good time last night!  And your father!  What?  I mean your sister!  Good one. The guys high five. Cambi and Vivica exchange looks of disbelief. Dooey lowers the panel.  Mr. Zadir, I'm pulling over here to get whipped cream.   711  Dooey pulls over and gets out. Doug looks out the window. 'S  He watches Dooey talking to the cash register person.  I'll be right back. Doug gets out.   711  Dooey hands the cash register person a credit card, who swipes it. Doug rushes in.  I'll take care of it. Doug grabs the phone.  Operator 238, please... What's up?      It's the same Switchboard Operator he talked to at the store. The following conversation is ...  resigned Hello, Doug.  Guess where we went tonight?  Let me see, the 711 on Ventura?  No, I mean, before this, you sly little credit vixen.  Doug!  The Roxbury with Richard Grieco and Bob Saget. You gotta come out sometime.  I would. But then there'd be no one to approve all the money you spend.  You're always thinking of me.  The card's good. 'Bye, Doug. She hangs up. Doug hands the phone back.  She approved.      Modern style house. Lights dot a gravel driveway that leads to the entrance. The limo drives up.  V.O. Sweet ass cottage, Mr. Zadir.  'S A . Spice Girls are performing. A pool with a waterfall is the center of the party. People are dancing, drinking, swimming, etc.  opens. Doug, Steve, Mr. Zadir and the girls enter.  Mr. Zadir, I am very impressed. For a guy who owns sleazy night clubs, the decor in your house is quite tasteful.  Good one. The guys nod to each other, proud of their compliment.  Excuse us, we're going to the ladies' room. The girls walk off. Mr. Zadir notices something. .  Anna Nicole! Put something on! You are making us sick! Mr. Zadir walks away.  Do you feel it, Steve? We are finally experiencing the party lifestyle to the fullest degree. Let's mingle. They walk over to a Fabio type .  How's it hanging? You want to mingle?  Cool party, huh?  who the hell are these guys ... I guess.  Yeah, I'd say it's kicking into gear right about... Steve and Doug pause a moment. Model Guy looks at each of them.  ... now.  So, what do you do?  I'm a model.  Oh, right. So are we.  It's a hard job.  Yeah, you know, like you got to stand still all the time and uh...  racking his brain ... Standing still. Standing still is really hard. My foot cramps sometimes.  I know what you mean. What agency you with? Elite, Ford?  Uh huh.  to Model So, do you like mingling?  Excuse me. The Model Guy walks away.  Nice guy.  off at Model Guy See you on the shoot! As they start eating their pasta primavera again, a  emerges from the pool and walks directly towards them. Steve and Doug forget how to chew and stand, stunned.  Can you pass me a towel, please? They talk directly to her breasts, trying to be nonchalant, but answering questions she hasn't asked.  Good. How are you?  ... about eight o'clock, eight fifteen.  They're right behind you. Can you just reach over?  Thanks. All the time.  Sagittarius. .  Right off Sunset.  Vanilla mostly. She shoves by them and exits. Mr. Zadir comes over. .  Look at this, I have the Spice Girls, yet nobody is dancing. The guys snap out of it.  With all due partythrowing respect, you know what the problem is, Mr. Zadir? This pool is taking up all the prime dancing real estate.  Yeah, you know, if there were a big piece of glass you could put over the pool, you could use it as a dance floor. And it would be really sweet because people would feel like they were dancing on water.  And you could put fish in the water and it would be like the ocean.  Or, Doug, you know what would be another amazing idea? You could have a special room for people who want to dance naked.  Plus, then you could have a room next to that room with a oneway mirror so other people could watch them. .  calming them down Boys, boys, please let's not talk business. We'll schedule a meeting for this. Guys silentlyjoyously high five their meeting. Cambi, Vivica enter.  There you are.  We got scared.  protective Of who? We'll kick his ass.  No, we got scared someone stole you away from us. Doug and Steve ponder the meaning of this statement for a beat, having rarely heard a compliment.  realizes it's a compliment Oh... to Steve Like some other girls would steal us away.  Oh, right... Oh!  Mr. Zadir, would you mind if we borrowed them for a while? .  Yes... They all look at him. .  ... No! laughs Got you!  Good one, Mr. Zadir.  He totally got me.  Mr. Zadir, let me just say that you, sir, are a load and a half. .  laughing Thank you, Doug! The guys and girls exit.      The guys are entertaining the girls with their killer impression of Hall  Oates.  singing ... Oh, oh, here she comes... The guys do a here she comes step.  Watch out, boy, she'll chew you up. Doug chews.  Whoa, here she comes...  She's a maneater! The girls look blankly at them. The guys stop.  Guess who that was?  I have no idea.  Well, I was supposed to have a moustache.  Sonny and Cher?  Okay, we'll give you another h The guys get into their Hall and Oates positions.  singing She's a rich girl.  singing And she's going to go far 'cause she knows it doesn't matter anyway. Cambi stands.  shutting them up Guys, guys! I have an idea. You want to have some fun?  Sure, fun is our last name.  Plus, fun spelled backwards is 'nuf.' And you can never have 'nuf' fun.  takes Steve by the hand Great. Let's go.  Where we going?  They're staying in here. And we're going in there. Vivica pulls Steve into an adjoining guest bedroom.  as the door shuts Steve!  Doug!     Vivica sits on the bed. Steve awkwardly stands by the door.  Nice room.  Yeah, it's great. yelling at door Doug, you should check out this room!  I think he's busy.  I'm just a big believer in sharing. Vivica sensually lies back on the bed, staring at Steve. Steve is uncomfortable, starts walking around.  Steve, why don't you come over here? Vivica pats the bed a few times, inviting him over. Steve watches. Thinks. Then goes over to the bed and also pats it a few times, turning it into a drum solo.  stopping him Steve! Steve stops, looks at her.  Viv, you know what I heard when I first met you?  What? Steve starts making a very loud inappropriate shrill ambulance siren sound  over and over.  What are you doing? Steve stops.  That's an ambulance. Coming to take me away because the sight of you just stopped my heart. Steve is very proud of his comment, and makes another siren sound.      Doug is sitting next to Cambi, trying to think of something to say.  trying to be suave So, Cambi, can I ask you something? Do you like blueberries or strawberries? .  Why?  I want to know what type of pancakes to order you in the morning. He looks proud of his line as we begin to hear Steve O.S.  from the next room  making more , over and over.  You know, I was wondering... snaps, annoyed at siren sound Steve!  O.S. stops siren sound ... Sorry!  I was wondering... Doug starts looking at Cambi's shirt label.  What are you doing?  Checking your label. Just as I thought. Made in heaven.  Doug, you've gotten past the opening line.  Hey, is that a mirror in your pocket?  What?  'Cause I can see myself in your pants.  Hey, Doug, if I said you had a nice body, would you hold it against me?  confused What?      Steve and Vivica sitting on the bed.  And this guy on the phone turns around and he tips his hat like this. Doug does a tip your hat motion.  And who do you think the guy was? Vivica is bored.     . Doug is telling Cambi the same story.  And Steve was like 'Emilioooo!'      Steve is telling the story.  ... Emilioooo!      Doug still telling story.  Emilioooo! And it was really him.  Is this your first time?  What? Oh my God. That is hilarious. That is so hilarious! yelling at the door Steve, did you hear that? to Cambi You don't even know how funny that is. You are funny. You don't even know how funny you are! Man! Cambi pounces on Doug with a kiss.      Vivica is inches away from Steve's mouth.  Vivica, I've been thinking. Our relationship is really going strong now. We've had some great times together that I'll never forget. Remember when I saw you at the pool?  Yeah?  So, I was just remembering back. sighs You know, an open dialogue is an essential element to any successful long term relationship. I think we have something special going on here and I don't want to move too fast.  Is this your first time?  Yes. Isn't it yours? Vivica smiles and pounces on Steve, knocking him .      The bedroom doors simultaneously open. Doug and Steve excited, run into the hallway.  Doug, oh my god!  Oh my God! Did you just? 'Cause I just!  This is unbelievable!  This is historical! This what it's all about! Up Top! They highfive. Doug suddenly catches himself, changes back to cool attitude  Steve follows.  Not that it hasn't happened before.  Of course not.  I mean it was alright.  The usual. They stand there, posing cool, but awkward for a beat.  I'm gonna go back in the   Me, too. I'll see you later. They run back in the bedrooms.      Mr. Zadir's limo pulls up. Doug and Steve get out, shut door. Car drives off. The guys stand in place, in reverie.  Hey, Steve?  Yeah, Doug.  That was great.  I know. Are we A club people now? Doug looks at him  then to answer, he pulls out a small piece of paper, shows it to Steve.  You got a number! Wooo!  Woo! We got a number! They jump up and down, embracing, happy as hell.   'S    Doug is working feverishly at his desk. There are phone books, rolodex, staplers, notepads in front of him. Steve enters with a shopping bag.  Where have you been? We've got to get ready for our business meeting with Mr. Zadir?  I got some great new supplies for our business. Steve starts pulling items out of the bag, Doug doesn't pay attention.  'Post Its' to annotate important documents. 'Little Post Its' 'cause you write smaller than me. 'While you were out' pads  for while you are out. Scotch tape, in case the Post Its lose their adhesiveosity. And mugs with our names on them. Yours says, 'Doug.' Doug turns around.  Okay, here's what we're gonna do.  interrupting Did you call Mr. Zadir?  Steve, before you talk to a man like Mr. Zadir, you have to have a fully developed plan of attack. You have to have all your ducks in row.  I didn't know to get ducks.  That's an expression.  So, we're going back to the dance club idea?  Yeah. Now you set up the office. I'm gonna call some real estate people to talk about locations. At that point, I'd like to schedule a meeting. Can you do tweleve thirty. Doug checks his Filofax. Steve unwraps a new Filofax and starts looking through it.  I'm clear.  Great. Be prepared to discuss possible club names and themes.  What about music?  We'll have to schedule another meeting for that. Hey, you know what? Maybe we should have a pre meeting to brainstorm before our scheduled meeting.  Yeah. That way we won't look like idiots at our meeting.  Exactly. Okay, I'm gonna roll a few calls. We should order in.  I can take care of that. to door Ma! Doug pulls out the phone, starts dialing. Steve starts organizing the desk.  Hey, Steve?  Yeah?  I was just thinking. Dad would really be proud of us right now. They both smile. Mrs. Butabi enters. .  Boys, your father's furious. You were supposed to be at work an hour ago.  Alright, we're gonna have to do some rescheduling.     Doug, behind cash register, holding clipboard, on the phone.  Yes, hello, I'm interested in your sound systems. I've heard good things about your woofers and tweeters. Steve walks over.  Doug, I...  I'm on a call. Steve nods, knowing what to do. He pulls a PostIt, writes something down and sticks it on Doug's clipboard. A  walks up with a small plant. Doug puts a Register Closed sign on the counter. The Lady leaves and we  her  Mr. Butabi.  Mr. Butabi, where is the other cash register? . 'S  Cash register. There are several PostIts stuck to the counter. Steve is filling out another one. .  I'll be with you in a second, Mrs. Manicotti. Mr. Butabi goes over to the cash register.  One second, Dad. .  It's good to see you're on a break. I mean, after all, you've been here almost twenty minutes now and it's hard work listening to your walking man and ringing up the one customer you've had.  Dad, I'm sensing a note of sarcasm. .  This is a very nice sign. Except for one thing. exploding This is the only register! This is why I pay you  to push a button and take the money. Is that too much? Is there some problem I don't know about? Did you injure your button pushing finger in a bad cell phone accident?  Dad, why don't you go to Rexall's Drug Store. I think you need to purchase a bottle of chill pills. .  Just when I thought I had you doing the absolute minimum, you astound me with how much less you can do.  For your information, Dad, we are working our asses off.  Yeah, our week's filling up pretty quick.  Dad, last night, Steve and I happen to have made a very important business contact. .  Oh, what are you dancing the Macarena with Donald Trump?  Did you want me to go the drug store to get those pills?  I think we should tell him now. excited Dad, you're gonna love this. We're working on this club idea which could include many silk plant opportunities and guess who we thought could be our supplier? .  Yes, I need you to give me opportunities. I feed you, I clothe you, I put a roof over your head and I pay for your little phones so you can call other idiots. I give up on you two. I am ashamed to call you my sons.  There you go again, Dad. You always tell us to do something with our lives and when we finally do, what happens? You got to put us down. You never support us, you never encourage us, and you never care about what's important to us. Right, Steve?  Do you need a prescription for those pills? .  It's my own fault. I spoil you. From now on, you are no longer allowed to go out to clubs at night.  What? .  Now enough wasting time. Go clean up the stock room.  You know what, Poppason, not only will Steve and I not clean the stock room, but we are officially out of here! to Steve Come on. Doug starts walking out.  But what about the stock room?  We quit! turns back to Dad And we don't need you! We made big contacts last night!  Yeah, plus we met these girls, Dad, and you wouldn't believe what happened.  to Dad We're gonna make it without you. You'll see. Doug exits, Steve follows him. .  Yes, I'll see tonight when you get hungry and you come home to eat my food. And when you come crawling to me for more money!      Doug and Steve barrel out the front door and head straight for the van. Emily, in a sexy sun dress, carrying two big huge oversized lightbulbs where her breasts would be, steps in front of them.  Hey, Steve! Do you want to go to the beach later? I've got my bathing suit on under this.  to Emily Not now! Doug blows by Emily. Beat. He steps back   takes a second look at the odd bulb positions  and exits again. The guys start getting into the van.  I'm not talking to you, Doug. You're an ass.  Emily, we're experiencing a major family crisis. I'm gonna have to take a rain check on this convo.  Steve! Car!  as he gets into the car Nice bulbs, Emily. Steve gets in. They .  yells after them So, you want to go out tonight?      The guys speed along on their way to Butabi. Doug is looking over a sheet of paper.  Okay, these are the ideas we'll pitch him. The Jungle Paradise.  Killer.  The Inside Out Club.  Money.  The Civil War.  That one needs work.  Yeah. We'll hold off on that one. And let's not forget our ace in the hole  The Naked Room.  I think we should call it 'The Nudist Colony.'  That sounds like a strip club. And this is a dance club.  You're right. We'll go with 'The Naked Room.'   'S  The silk van drives up. Steve and Doug get out and walk up to the locked gate.  Zadir's gonna be excited to see us. This is it, bro... Doug presses the intercom. They wait.  This is it. Doug presses the intercom buzzer again. No response. As they wait, Steve starts to sing to himself.  very softly 'This is it, make your mistakes where you are. This is it...' We realize Steve is singing This Is It by Kenny Loggins. Doug slowly joins in as they pass the time.  '... We're going no further.' The both step singing as Doug hits the buzzer again. After a beat of waiting, Steve picks up the song where they left off...  soloing much louder 'Here! The moment is now, no place for goodbyes...'  Male voice starts singing the next lyric.  V.O. 'And now I'm not so sure... doo doo... deep in my heart...'  V.O. This is it!  They stop singing.  V.O. You guys know 'Footloose'?  running to intercom Actually, we're here to see Mr. Zadir. It's Steve and Doug Butabi.  softly to himself '... pick up your Sunday shoes...'  V.O. Mr. Zadir's not here.  We were supposed to have a meeting with him about our ideas. Like there's one where the inside is outside and there's one about a jungle and...  shutting him up, covering the intercom Steve! Never talk concepts with the intercom. to intercom Can we come inside and wait for him?  V.O. No.  Can we leave him a message?  V.O. No.  to Doug Let's just forget it.  Stay strong, sailor. to intercom Do you know where we can find him?  V.O. He's at the office in Wilshire. They jump in the car and drive off.  V.O. singing 'Footloose' ... 'Everybody cut, everybody cut... doo doo.'      We see a large engraved marble Zadir Industries sign above the entrance.      We see each elevator button is the name of Zadir's many businesses Zadir Dry Cleaners, Zadir Beepers, Zadir Gaming  Entertainment, Zadir Real Estate, Executive Suite.  listen to a  of  by Haddaway. Their heads begin to bop very slowly. A hotlooking businesswoman gets on. They guys smile politely and wait patiently. We hear a . The businesswoman gets off.  Hey, Steve, did you notice we forgot to ask her something?  You mean, 'What's up?'  Yeah. That's weird.  Actually, it's not. We're both involved in serious relationships now, and our ladies know they can trust us. 'Trust' being the key element in any worthwhile commitment.  Why go out for burgers when we've got steak at home?  You're right. We should get lunch after this.       Elevator doors open. Doug and Steve exit onto a very modern white glass floor.  Doug and Steve walk over to a .  Doug and Steve Butabi for Mr. Zadir.  You're brothers? Doug and Steve give each other a look. They're tempted to tell their brother joke.  Ma'am, thanks for the setup, but we really can't get into that right now. Steve looks down the hall of offices to his left. 'S  At the end of the hall, Mr. Zadir and Dooey quickly walk by.  Doug, Mr. Zadir! The guys run down the hall.  Hey, you can't...!  The guys run past office files, they pass a Fed Ex woman. Steve stops in his tracks.  Look, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm in a serious relationship right now. Steve immediately jumps back into full stride.  The guys turn a corner.  As Dooey closes the door, we see Mr. Zadir at the head of a board meeting. Zadir does not see them. Dooey turns around.  Dooey! My very main man. Up top! The guys raise their hands to high five.      Dooey forcefully drags the guys by their shirts, through the door and towards the elevators.  sincere So, Dooey, how's everything goin'?  Ragin' party last night.  Yeah, is that what my mother said to you... indicating he heard them in the limo ... or was it my father? Dooey drops the guys next to the elevator, presses the down button, begins to walk away.  So, Zadir wants to have this meeting by the elevators? Dooey stops and slowly turns around.  Those Redi Whip cans were a big hit last night. I was out till four in the morning trying to find more.  impressed From dusk 'til dawn  you, sir, are a party animal.  threatening Don't go near Mr. Zadir. He was drunk last night and he doesn't even remember you. You think you're the first losers he's picked up that I've had to get rid of come Monday?  Uh... Dooman, I don't know if I'm reading my dissmeter correctly. Because are we being blown off.  Just stay away if you know what's good for you. Dooey walks away. The guys are in shock for a beat. Suddenly, Doug bolts full speed past Dooey and back into the office. Dooey follows.    Doug runs up to the shut door and starts banging. No response. He notices, to the left, a glass window looking into the conference room. 'S  Zadir looks up  we can't tell if he sees Doug or not.  Suddenly, two burly security guys pull Doug away.   'S    The security guys physically push the guys out the building.  to security Alright, so we'll see you guys later. The security guys, unfazed, walk back in.      The guys get in and sit there, depressed. After a beat...  What do you want to do?  I can't talk to you right now. Give me a second.  Maybe we should just go back to work.  Yeah, and maybe we should just go to college and not put gel in our hair and starts wearing blue jeans. Let's do that, Steve!  ... Sorry. Steve suddenly gets an idea and reaches into the glove compartment. He pulls out the piece of paper with Cambi's number on it  we see he's put it in a small lucite frame.  trying to cheer Doug up Cambi's number. Doug looks up at the number, starts to come out of his funk.  We had a sweet time last night, didn't we?  Sweet ass time.  Diabetic. I could see doing that again, maybe even a couple a times a week, right?  The ladies await, my friend. Cell! Steve slaps a cellular phone into Doug's hand. Steve looks down, shifts again, they pull out.      Cambi and Vivica are standing by the bar, talking to  and , two middleaged Japanese businessmen .  Yeah, I think it's great how you get to travel around the world.  in Japanese These hotties are sweet.  in Japanese Sweet ass. We hear a  in Cambi's bag. She checks the beeper.  Who is it?  I don't know. It's just a bunch of pound signs.      Doug is repeatedly pressing the phone pad over and over.  I'm not sure you're doing it right.  frustrated Steve, you have to hit the pound sign or it doesn't go through. sighs Maybe their phones aren't working.  Try putting in our number and then hitting pound.  Excuse me, Mr. Bill Nye the Science Guy. Doug starts putting in their number...      Cambi is talking on a cellular phone near the table, as Vivica entertains the Japanese businessmen.  Hello?  Cambi. It's your boyfriend. I need to see you.  not knowing who it is Uh... well, I'm at the Skybar.  Be right there... sweetheart. Steve gives Doug a thumbs up.      The van pulls up and the guys get out and head in.  How's my hair?  Good.  Longterm relationship good?  It's totally committed. You know, Doug, when things aren't going so well, it really makes you realize how much your woman means to you.      Steve and Doug enter and are hit with the unwelcome sight of their girls flirting with the businessmen. They strut over, ready to fight.  These guys bothering you?  Hi, Doug.  to businessmen You guys messing with our women.  in Japanese What's up?  You want to mix it up? Come on! Take me on. I'm insane. You don't know what you're dealing with. The businessmen look at them strangely.  Vivica, I'm feeling a little vulnerable here. I thought we had an understanding. And I can't believe you're willing to just throw away everything we've been to each other?  Doug, Steve, this is Akiro and Toronaga... they're my cousins. Steve is relieved, Doug is mistrustful.  holding out hand to shake Oh! Well, it's about time that we met the family.  pulling to Steve's hand back Come on! What do you think, we're stupid? How can they be your cousins?  like talking to a child Well, his mother and my mother are sisters and that makes us cousins.  ... Oh. Okay.  to Akiro and Toronaga Would you excuse us a second?  Yeah, we just got to talk to them a second.  Yeah, 'cause we slept with them last night so...         Cambi and Vivica, Steve, Doug assemble near the Silk van.  So, did you guys have as good a time last night as we did?  I had a great time, Vivica. In fact, I think we've reached the point where I can comfortably call you 'Viv' and leave out the 'Ica.'  So, you guys want to hang out or see a movie or do what we did last night... or eat or... just do what we did last night or hang out, eat and then do what we did last night or... you know, whatever... and do what we did last night.  Sounds good. Cambi gives Doug a kiss. He melts, then quickly tries to act cool. Vivica affectionately holds Steve's arm.  Viv, I'm glad our relationship is strong enough to withstand the hard times  like when were just in the bar  I also think we're not just projecting onto one another but dealing with the reality of who we are. And most important, we know how to listen.  What?  Hey, you boys want to go somewhere quiet? The girls look at them seductively.  No...  Yes!  in reference to joke It's gold. I'm telling you. The guys high five and laugh  they walk to the van. Doug opens the passenger door.  Ladies, have your boarding passes ready. Cambi and Vivica just stand there.  What are you doing?  Aisle or window seat? I'm sorry, ma'am, you're gonna have to check that bag... The movie on this flight will be uh... I don't know. I can't think of any more.  Where's your car?  Our dad got mad and took it away.  Your dad?  Yeah, we used to work for him, but we quit today so actually we're unemployed.  You're not in business with Mr. Zadir?  Yes, we are. But, not now. We just met him last night. But, we will be. So, no, but, yes.  Especially, if we ever get to see him again. The girls digest this for a beat. Cambi signals to Vivica and they both start walking back to the bar. The guys, confused, run up to them.  Hey, we were just kidding about those boarding passes. You can get in.  Get away from us.  What's going on?  You guys are a big waste of time.  ... Como what?  Steve, you're a jerkoff.  Well, I'm glad you shared that with me. That's a big step for the both of us.  Guys, consider what we did with you last night a favor. Now do us a favor and never talk to us again!  What did we do wrong? We'll change.  No, you can't change. You and your brother are ugly pathetic losers. to Cambi That's the problem with nightclubs. Poor schmucks look just the same as rich schmucks. The girls walk back to the bar. The guys watch them go.  as they walk I can't believe we actually had sex with those asswads. I hope the nips are still at the bar. The girls disappear into the bar. The guys stand in shock, trying to absorb the ultimate rejection.      Slowmoving congestion. We see the Silk van driving in the middle of it.      Doug and Steve sit in silence for a while.  trying to cheer him up Hey, Doug, I think some of the plants are beginning to wilt... no, I'm just kidding. They're made out of silk. Doug doesn't respond.  singing quietly ... 'This is it.'  cutting him off Steve! This is the worst day of my life. So, if you don't mind, I really don't want to hear you talk right now.  Well, it hasn't been the Super Bowl for me either... mumbling ... just trying to get you to talk.  blowing up Talk?! You want me to talk, Steve?! I'll talk. Blahblahblah, talk, talk, talk! I'm talking! You feel better now?! Talk!  I don't really know how to respond to that.  ripping into him Oh, big surprise, Steve. You don't know how to do something. You don't know how to work the clubs, you don't know how to talk to women. The only thing you know how to do is ask me how to do everything!  But, I   That's why everthing's gone wrong... 'cause you're holding me back.  'D You're so needy all the time. You're like this thing tied to my leg, like this... dragging thing...  A lead weight?  Yes, a lead weight. sincere Thanks. back to angry And I am not letting you drag me down anymore.  ... You know, can't blame me for what happened. Today was a series of random events gone awry.  Maybe events wouldn't go awry if I had someone with a brain sitting next to me.  Oh, yeah. Well, maybe I'd have better events if I was with someone with a higher level of looks and taller. Doug, in shock, starts to hyperventilate from anger.  breathing heavily I'm tall enough to kick your ass.  cupping his ear Did you say something? It's hard to hear things that low down to the ground.  Well hear this. Consider me your exbrother.  I don't care.  You care about this? Doug fakes throwing a punch  Steve flinches. Steve fake punches  Doug flinches.  You want the real thing?!  No.  Then stop talking to me.  My pleasure. They continue along in silence, both looking miserable.      We see the Silk van parked in front of the house.   'S    Steve lies on his bed looking out the window. Doug's bed is empty. 'S  We see Doug carrying all his clothes into the Butabi guest cottage.  is sad. Gets up, walks to Doug's desk and throws all the Postits and business supplies in the trash.      A simple studio.

It'll never yell at you and call you a 'loser.' It'll always be in your room where you left it, not suddenly move out into the guest house. The customer is crying. Mr. Butabi walks over, pulls Steve aside. .  What are you doing? All the customers are depressed.  looking over at empty register I'm just used to seeing Doug at the register. I miss him. .  But he's only in the guest house. It's ten feet away. It's like a mansion in there.  There's no cable. .  There is Cinemax.  crying But, there's no H.B.O. Steve walks off, upset.      Emily, in skintight shiny body suit, is exercising on the Peck Deck portion of a Nautilus machine  filled with people. She finishes her last repetitions.  Nine... ten. She stops. Then looks in a little workout book entitled Diet to Get Steve.  Okay. One more set. Add ten pounds. She bends down and pulls the metal pin out of the weights.

I know a place with good spinach wraps?  Look, Emily, I know you've had your heart set on this a long time, but, the truth is we're from two different worlds. I mean, I'm a rebel... and you're kind of the sweet girl next door type.  Steve, I work next door. It's not a type, it's a location.  You know what I mean. I don't know if you can handle a guy like me. I'm used to more, like experienced women.  Duh. You're forgetting  I got to college. Translation  drunken orgies with occasional Cliff Notes.  I know Cliff. Weak delts.  And I'm not one of those date rape crybabies.  Look, it sounds good, but I'm getting over a very serious relationship right now. It's gonna take some time to nurse my emotional wounds. And that could take, like, until Saturday.  Perfect, your dad bought us two tickets to David Copperfield, this Saturday.

She pushes him away into another girl who shoves him into a biker guy  who tries to dance with him.  C    The dogs are dragging a dead deer across the driveway.

What are you gonna wear?  dropping head to table Oh, God.  You got to hand it to Steve. That Emily's the perfect woman. Strong legs, low body fat, and a positive mental attitude. A lady like that can really keep you on track. Is it okay to wear black at an afternoon affair?  Shut up, you idiot.  Doug, I know you and your brother are having some problems, but that is no reason to refer to my intellectual capacity in a diminutive manner.  I'm sorry, Craig, but you totally Wolf Blitzerd me with the matrimony update. Do you mind if we just don't talk about my brother?  TenFour. Boundary set.  perking himself back up Look, did we come here for some Starbucks' latte chitchat or did we come here to hit on hotties?  Hotties.  Let's do it. They move out.

So, you want to shake it?  No, I think I'll just let it sit.  You sure?  Now that I've met you, I'm more sure than I've ever been. Ellen walks away.

Filled with the entire Butabi and Anderson family, including old folks. This is the prewedding rehearsal dinner. .  And the hors d'oeuvers are hummus dip and babaganoush...  Who's going to eat that? You should have pigs in the blanket and chicken fingers. Steve is sticking a spoon on his nose. Mr. Butabi takes it and taps his glass, standing up. .  Okay.

Well... to whoever they turn out to be.  standing up I would also like to thank everyone for flying in to join us. My brother and his wife from Chicago.

And that's not the only union I'm excited about. From what I understand, we got a new lampplant store. .  That's plantlamp store. Ha ha... that's a joke. But, seriously, I think it sounds better.  Steve, don't you want to make a toast?  No, that's alright.  pushing him up All the men are doing it?  standing So, okay, uh... I just want to say... what's up... Grandpa, Grandma, and those other two old people. Steve sits. Emily quickly stands.  I think what Steve means, is that, we're just thrilled with the way this family is coming together. And I'd like to share with you some of our business plans for after the merger. to Grandma Can you pass these out? Emily hands out business plan folders. .  I will get more wine. Mr. Butabi is looking through a wine rack. Steve enters.  Hey, Dad, do you think maybe we could cancel this whole thing? .  Yes, sure... turns to Doug ... Nooo!  Dad, that's so funny. But I really don't want to get married. .  You are serious? All these people are here and you are serious?  Dad, it's like, Emily had turned into this whole different person. I mean, at first, she was this girl that I really liked to have sex with. Then she turned into this other girl who I really don't want to marry  although I don't mind having sex with her. .  Look, the catering is paid for. The tents are all set up. Your grandparents flew half way around the world. Besides, all men go through the same thing the night before their wedding.  You mean, all guys feel sort of nervous and anxious, and kind of hope a train hits her and she eats a can of botulism or maybe she could hang out with a deer, and a hunter accidently shoots her or you know, when she's sleeping and she makes that nose whistle sound and you shake her to make it quiet but what you'd really like to do is take her stupid red toothbrush and ram it up her nostril into her skull. Mr. Butabi stares at him for a beat. .  Steve, these feelings are perfectly normal.      Doug looking out the window. 'S  Wedding chairs. Tents. Flowers. Suddenly, we hear a  at the door.

Doug peels through the window at him.     Beautiful wedding layout. Guests mill about. Craig is lifting an ice sculpture off it's base. Steve is next to him.  Craig, I know you can lift it. Now can you just listen to me?  putting down sculpture I got it. I walk down the aisle. I stand next to you. And I settle any interwedding party skirmishes.  No, you're the best man. Not the wedding bouncer. You just gotta back me up.  Oh, you mean like spotting you?  Exactly.  Now, I get it. If things get too heavy, I step in.

You look very nice, Steven.  Thank you, Father. I love what you're wearing also. He's in regular black priest garb. He exits, confused.  Steve walks up to Mr. Butabi, who is waiting with the procession. .  You know, Dad, I've been thinking. I didn't really have time to have a bachelor party and that's a pretty important part of the marriage experience. So, we may want to consider delaying the wedding a couple of hours so we can go to a strip club or something. .  Sh! We're starting.  Richard Grieco, in tux, walks down the aisle with a frumpy .  Richard Grieco? How do you know Steve?  Look, I just don't want to be sued.

You are the man!  yelling up to Craig Shut up, Craig! I'm walking down the aisle, you dick! Emily goes back to walking gracefully. .  Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today, to join together...  Father? Did we already start?  Yes.  Oh. Sorry I thought there was going to be a buzzer or whistle or something.  ... To join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony. If any man can show any just cause why these two should not be lawfully joined together, speak now or forever hold his peace. Nobody speaks. Beat.  O.S. I am having a hell of a time!  Very good. Now I understand the bride and groom have each prepared something.  trying to rhyme Dear Steve, today I wear this wedding gown, and on my face there is no frown. I know our lives together will be great, just like when we saw David Copperfield on our first date. If you set something free and it comes back, you should love it forever, and like one of your silk plants, I'll try to stay beautiful, that is my endeavor. Love, forever, Emily. Steve steps forward, takes out a piece of paper, reads.  Emily, I used to see you outside my father's store. And then we went out on some dates and you let me have sex with you. Steve steps back. Priest looks to see if Steve's done.  I'm done.  Very nice. Steven, do you promise to love Emily, comfort her, honor her, in sickness and in health, as long as you both shall live?  My father already paid the caterer.  Emily, do you promise to comfort Steve, and honor him in sickness and health, as long as you both shall live?  I do. Mr. Butabi hands Steve the ring.  Now, Steven, repeat after me...  'After me'... just kidding. I'm nervous.  Now repeat after me, with this ring I thee wed...  With this ring, I thee wed. Steve puts the ring on her finger.

Sorry, Dad. turns back Emily, I'm sorry. I'm not ready yet. I liked your poem. Steve starts walking towards Doug. Mr. Butabi, furious follows him and reaches to stop him. Suddenly, a hand pulls him on his back. We  it is...  I'm sorry, Mr. Butabi, but as best man, my primary duty is to allow the groom to beat a hasty retreat should the occasion take a sudden ugly turn. Butabi tries to get around. Craig jumps in the way.  Don't test me. Steve runs up to Doug.  Hey.  Hello. They run out of the back yard.  Puts his arm around Mr. Butabi.  Mr. Butabi, as an actor, I'm a keen observer of human nature. And, I can tell that neither of your sons are anywhere near the maturity level necessary for this sort of commitment.  Emily is furious. Craig steps in the groom's spot.  Go ahead, Father.  What are you doing?  Emily, with all due respect to Steve, his discipline is lacking as is his appreciation for you. I, on the other hand, can bench press 305 lbs. I squat a clean 525, and my body fat percentage is less than two percent. Not only am I a professional trainer, but I someday hope to market my own protein bars and produce an Iron Buns video. Emily considers this a moment, then puts her arm through his.  ... Okay... We should look into infomercials.      Steve and Doug are on the bridge tossing rocks.  ... and I also took Craig out clubbing.  Mmhm.  That was alright. Plus, I rented a lot of videos and I didn't do much else.  Uhhuh.

You had me at hello. They hug and hold one another as the ...      The guests are gone. In the empty tent, Richard Grieco sits alone drinking wine with Mr. Butabi.  And it seems to me that you're a little bit harder on Doug than you are on Steve. Isn't that true? .  You are right. It's just that Doug is so rebellious, so hard to control.  Rebellious? Scrappy? Dreamer, maybe? What other young man does that remind you of? Mr. Butabi has an epiphany. .  ... Myself. Richard nods, knowingly.  So who are you really fighting with? .  Oh, Richard Grieco, you see right through me.     We  the front of the red  to reveal Doug and Steve in their usual positions.   Doug looks at his hair in the passenger sideview mirror.
