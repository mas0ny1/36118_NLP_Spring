His positioning makes it look like the banana and pears are his exposed genitalia. No one can help but stare at him.  V.0. Everyone's staring. Quick, lose yourself in a crowd, blend in. Ryan is morphed into footage of the Million Man March crowd. As the crowd listens to Farakan, Ryan looks over his shoulder for the cop.

Lifts the piano top, coils a hinge, but in the process clipping Mr Shine himself, , smoking, shirtless, wearing long coat, walkman in ear, and wearing headphones, acting very hyper, on the chin.

She leans back in the chair, but due to the greasedup back, she slips off the chair, and down a hillside.   Ryan and Cass enter. She is all over him. Kissing, working her way down his chest, then out of frame. We can only imagine what she is doing as he reacts in total ecstasy, flailing his arms, pounding his fist on the wall, banging his head.    Is just tying his shoe for him. He lifts her up. They kiss madly. He swings her around, romantically drapes her backward, goes to kiss her, but the elevator doors have opened and they slam on her head. She goes limp. Oops.

The sound of a stirring, powerful, violin and orchestra piece over    A 'S   What a night! The musical event of the year. A sign proudly proclaims Mr. and Mrs. Hibbing Goodhue Present the Concert Debut of Ryan Harrison. A poster of the handsome, distinguished Ryan Harrison, the former Robert Decker, is posed playing his violin. A Solid Out banner is placed over the poster.    Late, stepping from a cab, is Cass. She's dressed elegantly. Including long opera gloves. She goes past sveral black , who approach her.  I got loge, I got center aisle...     Loads of sparkling jewelry, formal gowns and tuxedos, the . cream of society. Cass is taken to her seat by an usher, who flicks on his flashlight which emits the static hum and the florescent light of Darth Vader's sword. He points to her seat. She opens her handbag, a small gun inside. She takes out a note addressed to Hibbing Goodhue. The usher gestures to the empty theater box, giving her the note back. She draws a glance to Goodhue's theater box. We can't help notice that Abraham Lincoln and Mary Todd Lincoln are sitting in the adjoining box, watching happily. Cass is drawn to the music.    A confidant, mature,debonair Ryan. He's playing flawlessly. It's so obvious the hands do not belong to our actor. He plays so vigorously that he jabs his bow into the eye of a fellow orchestra member, Awi. Then an angle reveals several musicians behind Ryan are wearing an eye patch. One woman is in a football helmet with dark visor.    \\x0c13 Loves his playing. Their eyes meet.    Tt's her! He's not happy to see her. it affects him, he unintentionally hooks his bow in a violin string, it draws back, the bow acts like an arrow, it jes 0.c., Pingggg. Up and into the orchestra. Without missing a beat. Ryan takes another bow from a quiver on his back, doesn't miss a note. He's back to total concentration.    Cass checks her watch. One last look to the box. Angry, she tears up the note.    Playing. We see Cass leaving. In the f.g. the percussionist, with Ryan's bow lodged in his chest, staggers by camera.    His hair, and a huge amount of hair, is flopping to and fro as he plays. He sees a rather upset Cass exit the theater.         the faint sound of Ryan's playing from the house. , handsome, mustached tycoon, dressed in formal wear, a successful British businessman, sips his tea. Looks out to sea. A storm is brewing on the horizon. Seals swim off in the surf, lie on the rocks. But there's something else about this stretch of water. He consults a map. He's discovered a secret. He looks through a pair of binoculars. We see an image reflected in the lens, a small sub rises out of the water. Hibbing lowers the binoculars. He heads back to the house.     Hibbing is riding it up to the house. The music becoming louder. He crumples Ryan's concert tickets. Faint .   Hibbing is annoyed by the music. He turns the radio station.   The  Secretary General, Sir Robert McKintyre, will be in Columbia Heights to give his antiterrorist speech. \\x0c14 Hibbing smiles, how.fortuitous, this only con suspicion.   Sir McKintyre is instrumencal in getting the  to actually do something. He's advocating that the world body form an international military action force, whose sole objective is to wipe out terrorist training bases around the world. He will be arriving on the twelfth of this month. Hibbing looks to the calendar. It reads This Monch and the number 10. He tosses down the map. A red circle indicates a point offshore where the sub surfaced, and the word Hylander. And a series of numbers.    Hibbing mixes a drink. The station is turned back to Ryan's concert.

His glass is leaking from multiple gunshot holes. At the bar he gets a box of Johnson  Johnson bandaid strips. He is about to open them when he is hit with very rapid single fire. He slumps against the bar. More shots as if from an automatic weapon. He leans on a chair. It's on wheels. He slides across the floor. More shots. Turns and slides the other way. More shots. Slides back again. Finally the bullets run out. We hear the firing pin, click, click. Boy is he relieved. He takes a cork from a bottle and plugs up a bullet hole. A beat.

Backup to add body finesse, and bumps into Ryan. He's not happy to see her.  Ryan, about this afternoon...  I've already forgotten our afternoon of love making and you dumping me and breaking my heart because you love someone else. Trying to get him to forgive her.  Join us, please.  I haven't played since che 92 Glympics. He picks up a mallet, tests it. His backswing knocks over a table, startling the party geers. The mallet head is  loosened, he swings forward, it flies off and hits a man in the head, he drops like a rock. Ryan rests the mallet on His Shoulder, kKlunking a man in the back of his head, nesS out coid. Cass has finisned another shot. Ryan walks to the ball.

'S   'S  Removing the wickets, he's bent over. And that butt is soooo tight.    Now the wickets are entangled around his hands. As Lauren  approaches, we see the coldness between Cass and Lauren.

During a piano solo, Ryan emphases the music by whipping his bow in the air, Whoop, whoop. The whipping movement makes Lauren tingly. She takes a cigar from an ornate cigar box. Rolis it in her fingers. Then over her thighs. Now starts to lick the tip suggestively. Ryan becomes a bit aroused. He is standing behind an end table, the drawer slowly starts to open. He watches carefully as she bites off the tip of the cigar. Aw, Ryan can feel that in his happy zone. The drawer quickly closes. She loves the effect she has had on him, she smiles coyly, tobacco in her teeth.    Finishes the audition to nice applause.    Cranks a wheel, which has rubber hands attached to it,  wearing white gloves. They slap, more like a baseball card in the spokes sound, against a stationary hand, clap clap clap.   I felt every finger movement. Hibbing, what do you think? She hands her husband the cigar. Hibbing seems uninterested. He picks up his brandy snifter, fish swim in it, walks te the bar. His back now to us. Ryan's sense of it is he has failed.  Hibbing and I have only been married for two months. I'm afraid I can't read his moods. \\x0c 2i 6  No need to apologize. heartbroken I...I'1l be going. Thank you for your time.

Lauren and Ryan wave as Hibbing drives off. Lauren turns to Ryan. She's hot for this guy.  Will I be signing 2 contract?  A simple handshake will do. He goes to shake her hand. She takes it, sensually licks  between his fingers.  I spilled a root beer. She cradles his hands.  So soft. Yet so powerful. They could crush me like a Marine in heat. He removes his hands. She wants to kiss. He'd love to, but he pulls back.  Please, no. My head is spinning like a dreidel ina sandstorm. I should go. It's hot out, and the leather seats are burning up.

You're a married woman, and I'm not.  You don't know what you're missing. I used to lick envelopes for a living. Those long manila ones. As Lauren slides out of the car, the envelope imagery sizzles in Ryan's key erogenous zone, we see the car antenna slowly rising.    Walking toward the house.

Sean is checking the murder scene. Lightning illuminates Sean's blackgloved hand grabbing the map off the bar. Lights from a car. He ducks out of sight.     Ryan drives up. Cell phone wrapped around end dangling from the wheel. He exits the car, his coat draped over his shoulders, very continental, and wearing a hat befitting a true musical maestro and carrying his violin case. He notices only one light on in the house. He doesn't notice a shadowy figure hurry by the window as he heads around the back of the house.     Ryan finds the door is ajar.  Hellc? No one in sight. He enters. The  im che breeze.

During the fight Sean is in the shadows. In fact, no matter where he goes or ends up, hes in a shadow. Ryan finds that quite amazing. So Ryan can't make out who it is.  casts light into the room off and on during the struggle.

He's pulled off, but his lips, acting like suction cups. stick, stretch, then snap. Ryan is spun against the wall, nose to nose with a painting, then dragged to the floor. The map has been stomped on, and all the scuffling causes it to be kicked under the couch, and out of sight.      Sean is on top of Ryan. Ryan grabs the guy's arm. In the  struggle, Ryan is mortified as he ends up with an artificiai right arm. Lots of wires, sparking, pulleys. Sean stands up as does Ryan. Sean throws a left. Ryan blocks it. Sean throws what would be a right. Ryan ducks the missing arm punch. Sean snatches the arm back and runs. Ryan dives and tackles him. An artificial leg comes off in his hands.

A quick moment of the Ryan and Sean fight.  Remembering the horror of it all.  More fight. Tussling, grappling. Two of the positions Ryan and Sean are in look rather sexual, a rolling on the floor 69er, and doggie style.  A woman skipreping naked from the waist up.  Has no idea what the hell that flashback was about.  Piece of paper burning in the fireplace.  From the fireplace he takes out fragments of a charred map, with the red circle spot.  Submarine. And the name Hylander. And that series of numbers. a noise of a key in the door. Ryan hides.    Cass enters. She's grabbed by the arm and swung facetoface with Ryan. A harder, wiser Ryan.  It's you! \\x0c4l He grabs her wrist. Ryan with a,  Geshundteit.  A key!  Oh, yo no sabe usted hable espanol.  Cut the French. You let yourself in.  I'm a friend of Lauren's.  Friend? She's just the person I want to talk to. Your Popeil pasta maker is grinding out fettuccini laced with lies. I may be a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king, I've been up, down, over and out, but I'm no chump. Why are you here?  No one's been in the house since Hibbing's death, so...  The killer always returns to the scene of the crime, that's what you're thinking, isnt it toots?  T never said that. .  Someone said it. .  You just did. Oh yeah, right Look.  I wanted to look for clues. \\x0c 42  That and a cup of coffes , get you a dime.  I think you're innocent.  I've let my guard down twice in my life. Twice bitten and a penny short. He covers our view of Cass. The actress leans around him awkwardly to be included in the shot.  Cont'd All I had was a one way ticket to Palookaville, but then this oyster was at my feet. People stood, bravoed, they ovated. I was somebody, I was a contender. Now I got white flashes and bits of burned paper to clear my name.  You've got more than that, Ryan, you have me.  I've been Mr Doormat long enough. A woman has wiped her feet on me for the last time. And from where I'm standing, you're a woman, from your tips to the top of your head. And lady, this pooper scooper is through being stuck with all the crap. This petting zoo for chumps is closed for good. Stay away. This rooster doesn't crow for anyone. He exits. She quickly runs to the answering machine. Pops out the tape.     We  4 ! It's Fergus. lights flashing. Blocks the drive.    \\x0c43 Fergus, Bagley and Orone burst out of the car. the car is the big police emblem with the motto and to Protect. The car rolls forward as Fergus  The bus stop in front of Roman's is the 550 Express tc the Public Access Beach. Scour every inch of the area. Orono, chase the car, put it in park. Orono runs off.

He barely looks at her.  Cont'd Bra sizes. I'll see who belongs to those trucks. Go! Go! Go!     Fergus is looking in the trucks as Ryan, his back to us, wearing a Davey's jacket and cap, is working away with a weedwhacker, Ryan works his way around the back of a fence, he cuts down each picket one by one, then a lamppost, a mailbox, a stand of flowers. He notices he's cut the tips of his shoes off. The frayed leather exposes his socks.    into cell phone I'll need further units, a road block, and a copter. Fergus notices the cut up fence.  Harrison? could he have been? Where's that gardener? \\x0c Fergus draws his gun. Runs down the che house, unseen.     Ryan runs across the busy street.    A truck sounds its horn, will he stop in time? Ryan lays down. The truck passes over him. He's unscathed. But 4 closely following street sweeper comes by and he gets caught up in the brushes. He twirls around from brush to brush. Finally the ordeal is over. He stands.    Calling out to Bagley and Orono  That is our man! He, Bagley and Orono converge on a dizzy Ryan.  'S    Cass sees Fergus and his gang almost on top of Ryan, who is too dizzy to run straight.     Cass drives, purposely cutting Fergus, Bagley and Orono off. They stop as she passes by. Fergus gets a quick look at the car. And now no Ryan.  She meant to do that.  Women .    Sees a manhole cover is off,  of feet.  Gotta gopher. as he enters the manhole, he's snapping orders Spread out, sse where this comes out. 44 \\x0c48 he's out but pops hi up for one more thing Call the Department of... Never gets to finish. Oreno tosses the manhole cover back on, clobbering Fergus on the head. We  an  Flannggg!  'S  Cass has observed. She takes out a Sewers of the City guide map, peels out.   Fergus is holding his head, gun in hand. He's wearing his official police waterwings as he runs through the tunnel. Splash, splash, splash. . We have Fergus and Ryan running up and down the tunnel, back and forth crisscrossing, always just missing each other. A lot of splashing in the water. At one point, Ryan slides down a tunnel, laying on his back, his arms folded, it's like a waterslide. He ends up at a wired off end of the tunnel that is piled high with debris. He tears off the fencing, freeing the jam up, a huge boulder rolls at him. Ryan runs, the boulder on his heels. He grabs onto a root and swings as the boulder passes under him and rolls 0.C. to the  cf  being knocked down. Fergus hears this, runs.    Ryan running, pulls up just in time.   'S  The tunnel drains into the dam spillway. We see his feet  hanging over the edge of the pipe. His toes rip through his shoes and grip the pipe edge. To check the situation out, he leans forward, at an impossible angle. He slowly straightens up.    He's trapped.  0.C. Hands up! Panic. He raises his hands. \\x0c46    Gun trained on Ryan. reaches behind his belt, we expect handcuffs, but he pulls out a large pair of leg shackles, and ball and chain.  It's over, Harrison.  T've been wrongfully accused! It's the onearmed man. He could have been in a sub off Geodhue's shoreline. There was amap. The name Hylander...  not interested You've been convicted of murder and have killed twice since then, I'm taking you in. Ryan looks over the edge.  No... Fergus comes toward Ryan. Ryan fills with resolve.  No...I'm not going back. Ryan turns around.    Gains a bit of courage. Holds his nose. Leaps, but having forgotten about the low height of the tunnel, he jumps up instead of forward. He bangs his head into the tunnel ceiling, he's unconscious on his feet, he wobbles, falls. Fergus runs to the edge and sees   Ryan inside the torrent of water which roars into che spillway.   He pops up, a fish is in his mouth, he spits it out. With a salmon at his side he tries to wriggle up the spillway. The raging river is toe strong, it takes him down stream. He . slams into and is dragged over every possible rock and log in \\x0c47 o obvious is, an the river, inclu i into a buoy it's a dummy. Finally he goes over Big Muth enormous drop.  'S    There sits a Female Lifeguard ala Baywatch. The young, nubile beauty points cut into the river. Grabs her life buoy, runs. We now do a shotforshot parody of the Baywatch opening. But add a lot more gratuitous butt, breast, and pec shots. Ryan is nowhere to he found.     We see Fergus and his pecple. Fergus is upset.  This river empties into Sullivan Lake, which has four islands, an average depth of 23 feet and a playland with a merrygoround not unlike the one in the 1973 delightful Redford, Newman romp, The Sting. Winner of seven Oscars. The sequel didn't have the heart nor the story. And Mac Davis, please. I want cops up and down this river. A dozen divers. Sheriff's boats thick as gators on a drowning man.

Lauren snaps back to the hardened terrorist, and butts him with her weapon. He fails out of frame.     pe Ryan is wet, exhausted but free. Or is he? A car pulls  front of him, cutting him off.

Ryan, I can help. I took this tape from Hibbing's answering machine. Lauren said she never wrote a note, you never called her. This is proof you did. He goes to take it. But she pulls it back.  To the cops there's no proof in this pudding. I'ma cornered badger, il live by my wits, I'll eat my young. I have to clear myself. I have to find the onearmed, one legged, oneeyed man.  We will. What did you find at the house? He places the burnt map on a patio table. She sits. He joins.  This refers to a sub. Hylander...  A code. Here, these... The numbers 051297.  License number? Lottery ticket? Wait. She makes slashes with a pen '051297.  A date?  Jermaine Jackson's birthday?  t'm mot sure. \\x0ca2 A whisp of heir hangs over her rehead. He gently oushes it off her forehead. A like lock of hair hangs from Ryan's head. She brushes it back.  I have to move on. Here's looking at you, kid. You're the thing dreams are made of. But me and women, we're like fire and water, flammable and wet. He kisses her on the forehead, leaving a big red lipstick mark. He enters the condo. She follows.  'S    Ryan collapses from exhaustion, he swoons. She grabs onto him.  You're exhausted. I'll give you a sponge bath, a bracing enema, and make you something to eat. Put your weight on me and I'll take you into the bedroom. He does. No way she can hold him. They fall out of frame. A candy dish from a coffee table flies into the shot.     It's where Cass picked up Ryan. The squad car is parked nearby. Fergus, Bagley and Orono search the roadside.  A picnicker said she saw a man, wet and dripping, walk this way.  Gather all the leaves for trace evidence. Shoot and gut every animal in the park, the stomach contents might contain droppings, something that could be a clue. Donate the meat to charity.

Bagley offers Fergus the phone. \\x0c54  Cass Lake. Says she knows where Ryan is. With her.  'S  Ryan sleeping. Opened phone book on the nightstand. He wakes as he hears a door quietly closing. Startled, he sits up. It must have been Cass. He notices carved into the headboard, Ryan heart Cass. He feels comfortable being here. He notices Cass left a change of clothes. And food is on a tray.

Our newscaster,    For thirtysix hours Ryan Harrison, three time murderer, has been a fugitive. Lt. Fergus Falls is heading the worldwide manhunt. Police helicopters, dogs, psychics, and thousands of police are involved. Plus millions of average citizens who would give their left nut to come up with that fiftythousand dollar reward. And who couldn't use that income? A couple on a fixed income. A teacher. Especially a Struggling artist. I personally wouldn't trust one of those for a million dollars.    Artist?...he's heard enough. Why wouldn't Cass turn him in? He's twisted the spaghetti around his fork, the whole plate of spaghetti. it's all the way up his arm. It's like a \\x0c spaghetti mufi. He slices out  Or almost shut. He opens it. Cass is spea g soft phone. It's a hushed conversation. He can hea. the remote. Mutes the set. As he does, we see the Newscaster, Cindy continue talking. Then realizes no sound is coming out of her throat. She yells. Still she can't hear anything. She panics. She yells for help. The Stage Manager comes onto the set. As he talks te Cindy, he toc realizes he has no voice. They both panic. Ryan has heard Cass say No, he's alone. He closes the door quietly. He has to know more about Cass. He searches her dresser drawer. Under a lot of very racy underwear, he finds a scrapbook. Looks through it.    Articles about her paintings. Clippings about Ryan His rise to stardom. His murder conviction. A wedding announcement of Hibbing Goodhue and Lauren, and a society column headline Successful Businessman and Worthless Shit Wed. Finally 2 page from The Other Daily Newspaper .    Looks it over. We see an article headlined This Isn't The Story You Want. Another headline reads Story You Want Is At Bottom Of The Page. He sees it. CU    Brody Kelley, inventor of large print alphabet soup for senior citizens, former Riverdance dancer, and accused murderer and smuggler, was found hung in his cell last evening.

And surprisingly articles and pictures of his first trial and the escape, under his real name Robert Decker. What he doesn see is an article that falls to the floor. CU  Dr. Yanock Savack was arrested for performing surgery enabling noted criminals to... Cass's foot accidentally steps on the story. As she    . Enters. She has a gun. Ryan panics. Before anything is said, there's pounding on the front door.  It's the police! Ryan believes he's been betrayed. To make a quick exit, h tosses a jar of face powder at her. But it blows back in his face as he has tossed it in the direction of a fan. He scoops up the answering machine tape from the dresser, and the cloud masks his retreat into the bathroom, passing the  where paramedics are tending to the Newscaster and Stage Manager's throats. Of course the paramedics can't hear each other talk. They keep gesturing, What! I can't hear you!.   A window is a bit out of reach. He walks 0.C. We  4 mighty , a . Walking into frame is Ryan, carrying the toilet. Cass is pounding on the decor.  0.C. Ryan, you cant get away, Ryan places the toilet under the window, steps on it, climbs out the window.  'S    \\x0cS7 Fergus, Orono and Bagley burst in, guns drawn.  'S    Ryan sees a large hamper containing rags below. He has no choice. He jumps.  'S      Ryan flops inside. The lid clamps shut. Two men in protective suits, complete with hoods, gas masks and rubber gloves, wheel the hamper to the back of their truck. In the b.g. we see Bell Day Care Center. The hamper is dumped into the truck.   Ryan tumbles out. He emits a big sigh of relief and then Blaa! He's in a mound of brownish, yellowish, stained white cloths. Whoa and the stink! The doors are closing. Leaving us with a panicked look on his face.     The sign on the door reads Rosener Diaper Service You Shit Em, We Clean Em! The truck drives off.  'S    Fergus breaks in. But no Ryan, no Cass.  We throw a shoe each time we start to gallop. Grabs a framed photo of Cass.  . This is Cass Lake. Face of an angel. Tag and log everything. I want carpet fibers, people. Vacuum!     The truck pulls up. The men, still masked and gloved, open the back door. We don't sse Ryan as they grab a bundle of diapers and head for the building. Ryan, blue from Holding his breath, hops out from under the pile. Bolts our of the truck. \\x0c38    Takes his first breath. A huge gasp of air. Plants sway in the intake. He hurries away from the truck. He smells mighty powerful. Flowers wilt as he passes by them. As he passes under a tree, a bird, still holding on to a branch, flops into view from above. Ryan passes an outdoor newsstand.    As he walks by, he grabs magazines. Each magazine he passes bursts into flame. Ryan ducks into an alley.   Ryan tears out the perfume adds and rubs them over his body . Then he sees     A rather large complex. A blinking sign reads We Specialize in Artificial Limbs. Another sign Lose Two Limbs, Get One Free!. Legs Legs Legs! The perfect place to search for the killer.    As he crosses the street, we see a car drive into the hospital parking lot. Lauren at the wheel of the car. Banners welcoming the  General Secretary hang from lampposts.  Mc     Nearby is an Amundson Glass Co. truck. The Sperm Donor Night Deposit Box is very visible to us. Very lictle activity.    Sees a way in. Grabs.a white paramedic's coat from 4 cab of an ambulance...or so he thinks it is. He enters the hospital. A sign on the door reads No Shirts. No Shoes.

Ryan casts out the stethoscope, it hooks in the Security Guard's ears, Ryan yanks him toward him, punches him in the face. Grabs his gun, sticks it in the back of his waistband. Drags him in the elevator. Doors close.  5 \\x0c61 Ryan gets  handcuffed.    2 Saw the guard in the elevator. He comes at Ryan.  2 Hey you! Ryan reaches for the gun in his waistband, but it falis inte his pants. A fight starts. During it, the gun hangs in the seat of Ryan's pants. It looks like he's carrying a major accident in his underwear. He makes repeated dips into his pants to retrieve it, but can't fish it out. He finally unzips his pants and shoves his hands around inside his shorts, trying to grab the thing. A very odd sight to Security Guardg 2. The best Ryan can do is stick the barrel out of his fly hole. Security Guard 2 finally nas the drop on Ryan but    Knocks him out with a bed pan, Twangggg.  Quick. They drag Security Guard 2 into an examining room.   Ryan has the gun from his pants.  Of all the hospitals in all the world, you've got to walk into mine.

Cass had a hard time following that. Moan from the Guard. Another wannnng.     Ryan and Cass see a sign hanging on the door Back In Ten Minutes. He cries the door. Locked. An idea. He gestures for Cass to give him a hairpin. She acts as the lookout as he sticks the pin in the lock. Jiggles it around. The kmob and docr plate crash to the floor. The damn thing is still locked. Cass points out the duct work in the ceiling. Ryan sees two workmen carrying a pane of glass to replace 4 viewing window in the nursery. They're using those hand suction cups. An idea begins to stir in Ryan's brain.    Joined by Cass. She stands in front of them. \\x0c65  Guys, do I need breast implants? Whips open her blouse. The workmen block our view. But Zowlel    Sees they are distracted. Ryan dislodges the suction devices. He walks off with them. On the way, he accidentally suckers onte the wall. In pulling it off, he suctions onto a food cart. A janitor throws open a door. As it swings open, to block it from hitting him, Ryan holds up the suctions, and he suckers onto the door. Pulls them off and suctions onto his crotch, yank, yank, yanks. The janitor watches, its very strange looking. Ryan yanks some more, the janitor moves on. Finaily the suctions are freed, Pop! Aw. Ryan enters To Air Conditioning.   2 , white haired, half glasses, lab coat, enters with an artificial leq.  Here we are. Sorry you had to wait. Closes the door. We see it was all a show for the people in the hall. See's demeanor changes. He's covert, all business. And why?    Sits on an examining table. Removes his leg.  It's ready?  A work of art. He hears a sound from the duct work, clip, clop, clip, clop. On closer exam, we see the new leg is more in the shape of a rifle. That's because it is a rifle. Take off the foot and there's the barrel. Sean savors this new weapon.  Yes, very good.  The price is now twenty thousand . \\x0c66  Twenty?  My costs. My risks. Sean pulls a gun and silencer, poof. See is hit. He puts on the stethoscope, listens to his hearc. He dies.   Ryan is using the suction cups to pull himself along the smooth duct surfaces. He dislodges a whole section of duct work. Pulls it off. Moves on. Up a slight grade. Down again. This should be it. He looks through a vent grate. It's the Hospital Records Room. He removes the grate. Which reveals a lot of phone and electrical wires running across the ceiling.   Ryan looks through the maze of wires to the computer below. He notices the  security system is on. A red laser beam crisscrosses the floor in the shape of a Star of David.   Ryan spreads the wires to have a better look. He loses his balance, falls through the opening.   Ryan is caught up in the wires, he dangles like a marionette, bouncing and dancing about, a human Howdy Doody, coming within inches of the laser beams. He stabilizes. He reaches for the Off Alarm switch, he tilts, keys fall from his pocket, he catches them before they reach the beam. Now, in rapid succession, a lucky rabbit's foot, sunglasses, Tums, Tic Tacs, lip balm, pepper spray, gum and a yoyo, ail caught. The yoyo though does its yoyo thing and heads for the floor. Just as it was going to enter the beam, Ryan smaps it back up with a flick of the wrist, walks the dog with it, puts it away. With his foot he manages to hit the off switch.   Cass standing guard. Sean rounds the corner. They are face toface.  Where have you been? \\x0c87  Ryan is in there  Harrison? We kill the bastard.  Not yet. He's doing us a favor. Just like no more trace of Mary Kelley. Soon no record of you. Ryan is raiding the computer, She smiles. Sean agrees. This is a good thing.   Ryan extracts himself from the last wires. Sits at the computer. The keyboard is the most complicated piece of equipment ever. Triple the normal amount of keys. He timidily turns the computer on. Fwing, it comes on with a miid chime. He carefully hits several buttons. A disk shoots out of the machine, hitting him in the chest, Ow. He tries another sequence. It brings up the menu. He clicks through it. He clicks into Limb Replacement. It contains several names. He types in Addresses. They pop onto the screen. He types up Phone Numbers. That appears on the screen. Great! He decides to print it out. He brings the printer into play. The screen asks questions, he clicks Yes every time. CU  Screen Print? Ryan hits Yes. Screen From Pages? Ryan types in 23 to 24. Screen Thank you. How are you today, good? Ryan hits Yes. Screen Getting any? Ryan hits Yes. Screen Are you sure? Ryan hits No. Screen Have you heard the one about the nun and the rabbi? Ryan types Just Print! Screen Okay...okay...asshole! The printer finally kicks in. After a beat it prints out pages. Ryan sees an answering machine. He pops cut the tape. Puts in the one he took from Casss condo.  V.0O.  It's Ryan, I got your note. Im minutes away. Ryan is pleased. Evidence! Then before he can turn it off  V.0.  Hibbing, I know I shouldntc call. Sut you arent ac Ryan's concert tonight. I've got a gun. I'm desperately in love with you, You... \\x0c8 She hangs up. Ryan pops cut the rape. Grasps it My God! She killed Hibbing! He does the classic heartsick over Beroman and slamming his fist on the table from Casablanca. Ryan hasn't noticed but the printer has printed out pages and pages. It shows no sign of wanting let up. Ryan snaps back to reality, hits a series of keys, only accelerares che printing. One steady long sheer of paper, billowing up. He can't turn off the printer. The plug for the computer and printer have the desk jammed up against it. He tries. He can't get his hand down there. Meantime the paper is almost waist deep. He looks at the computer screen, he accidentally typed for the computer to print out 23232424 paces, not from 23 to 24. He must have ten thousand pages by now.  Paper billowing from under the door.   The end of the printout is entering the air conditioning unit.  Mc The Hospital Records Room air conditioning unit chews up the paper and spits it out as confetti. We see it pouring out of the air conditioner.   As Sean and Cass exit, they are being snowed on. Very strange for this time of year.   In searching for Cass and Ryan, Orono sses the paper that has billowed into the corridor. He opens the door to investigate. A paper avalanche engulfs him, Aaaaaaa! Ryan runs out of the room and down the steps.  Mc Ryan, angry, betrayed again. He finds an unlocked car. He gets inside.    Lauren's car pulls up. Lauren is surprised to see Cass.  \\x0c69 What does Ryan know?  Nothing.  He was with you, right?  called Fergus Falls using your name, but he keeps escaping. If he gets smart, he can identify my past. to Sean Harrison is over there. Sean spots Ryan. Pulls a knife from a compartment in the new leg. Stalks Ryan.   Ryan finds no key. He'll hotwire it. He's seen this done hundreds of times in movies.    Ryan ducks under the dash. Bulls down wires from behind the dash, it's a lot of wires. He touches two together, sparks fly, but the car doesn't start. He tries again and again. In the course of touching other wires, he plays hell with the car's electrical system. We see the antenna go up and down, the sunroof open and close, windows roll up and down, the  blasting out the voice of Mario Lanza, Be my love...! The  shoots out of the sound system.  screams from the radio.    Can't figure out what's happening with that car.    Was about to strike, but the huzzah has  2 . drawn to the sound. Sean sees this is not the time to strike.   'S  Sean joins Lauren and Cass. They drive off.     im to the dash. The The car seat rolls forward, pinnin 3 v air bags pop open. gh. imstrument panel dials blow out. The    \\x0c 78 Watches as Ryan finally drive. And not too successfully. He backs into a Potty, driving it into the street. The door swings open exposing a hard hatted workman sitting on the toilet. Surprised ta be out in public, as are the drivers of the cars in the intersection waiting for the light to change.       Establishing shot. It plainly reads Vancouver Art Gallery. At the bottom right of the screen we have Columbia Heights Courthouse.       Fergus is standing behind a clear plastic map of the city. A big X has been placed in Husset Park.  perplexed We lost him here. We have to pick up his trail. He walks, we notice the X is on his forehead. Bagley points toe it. Fergus rubs it off.  Cont'd Harrison murders Goodhue and Savack. Enters a hospital where a onearmed, onelegged, oneeyed man would be found, impersonates a doctor, nearly kills patients, assaults security guards, does kill a therapist, enters the computer, uses up all their printout paper, third degree papercut wounds on my officer, and he says he's innocent. This department's body chalk budget doubled with him in town. This is one sausage that holds some strange meat. What about Cass Lake?    Puts a suitcase on the table. Opens it up.

Signals for a recording to begin.    The Producer type inside. Acknowledges the signal. He points off to    A technician presses a button. Nearby an Amish technician works a bellows that starts a reel wrapped around a wagon wheel. .       Ryan  recorded  as he is put on hold, a muzaky version of Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head. Hangers and torn dry cleaning bags litter the booth. In the b.g. a dry cleaning van, driver stopped at the mens room, drives off. Ryan is in a stolen suit, tie, etc. He sees 4 newspaper, ic's dated May 12, 1997. It gets him thinking.  1237 is today. \\x0c together.  An assassination. He looks at the newspaper headline . ''T .

Thanks. Fergus and the guys can't believe their luck. They drop the phone, all run out the door as fast as they can. A beat and we hear Ryan.  V.0. he screwed up, under his breath \\x0c74 Clicks down the phone.       A beat passes, squad cars from north, east, west, and south converge into the booth, smashing it to shreds, banging into ene ancther in the process.  'S  Pulis up, he, and Orono jump out of the car. Bagley remains on her cell phone.  frustrated laugh Man is learning. He's leaving a cold trail. No footprints, mo tracks of any kind, he wants us to do our detective work, and by the change in humidity and northerly shift in the wind, I believe it is going to rain. it does. Orono opens an umbrella, which shelters Fergus.  Contd He is staying one step ahead of us. Why? He wants us close. He's onto something big. If he's captured, they Lock him up and some mystery goes unsolved. Orono, Sean Laughrea? . Scotland Yard, Interpol, Access America, Geraldo. No one has anything. Bagley approaching  Hylander is the security code name for the  General Secretary McKintyre.  Yes! Tt has slapped us in the face. Saddie up, veople. Climbing in the car. en ne er ninth \\x0ca  To McCarty! I want what chey have on Sean Laughrea.     Ryan cautiously looking around. He feels someone sneaking up behind him. Corner of his eye he catches a black hood. He plays it cool, then whirls around, socks the man in the face. What looks like a man in a black hood is actually a seal. The seal responds to the punch, flops over. Ryan sees Lauren on the pocl deck, using an amber light to signal out to sea. She's taking the tram down. to the shoreline. Ryan sees the boat house. He enters.     Ryan hears a male voice. And now a familiar one, Cass! But he can't hear what they are saying. To get closer, he hides behind huge Foreign Correspondent in the Mill big wooden gear wheels. 'S    Still can't hear that well, a word or two, one being nis name, and Cass saying Kill him. Ryan can't believe he fell for her lies over and over.    Enters. Snaps on a switch. Joins Sean and Cass..    The gears slowly come to life. We see they work a boat lift, which is lowering Sean's Zodiac into the water. Ryan notices his coat is caught and is slowly pulling him into the grinding teeth of the gears. He tries to pull it free, but no, luckily the coat comes off his body, but now his tie is caught. He yanks, no luck, and his pants leg is caught, damn! He quickly undoes his tie, and now his shirt is torn from his body. Hes down to his tshirt, and his pants leg still is caught. He struggles. to get out of his pants.    Cass thinks we can use Ryan as  patsy once again.  He's being blamed for every murder in town. They'd have... \\x0c76 She sees something strange O.c. 'S  ooks that Clothes are spinning around the gears of the mill. It like a very messy dry cleaners clothes carousel. and  shoe?    Stands so Sean and Lauren's backs are to the gears.  ...their man. No roadblocks to keep you from leaving Columbia Heights. .  We have a sub. We don't care about the bloody roadblocks. We'll be gone in minutes.  As much as E'd like to kill Ryan myself, I agree. It will throw everyone off our trail. she checks her watch Sean, the sub. Sean gets in the Zodiac. Lauren steps outside to watch. Cass runs and picks the clothes off the gears.    In tshirt, boxers, socks, one shoe. Snatches the ciothes from Cass's hands. Puts them on as he speaks. Dialogue has great urgency, the terrorists could arrive any second.  I'm here to stop your assassination of the  General Secretary.  So that's it.  I'm taking Lauren, her playmate, and you down hard.  \\x0cHe's dressed. He slaps her. He slaps her. He slaps her. She slaps him. 77 He's the oneeyed, onearmed, onel I kept Sean from killing you at the hospital. I had to pretend I was one of them.  He's finally mine. I'1l be ail over him like chocolate on a chin after a hot fudge sundae.  And that's not Lauren. It's Mary Kelley.  Kelley! Why are you with Mary Kelley?  She said she was my mother, I thought she was my sister.  My sister.  My mother.  mocking My sister, my mother. Ow. .  When I was two she left me at an orphanage. I was told she was my sister. I know now shes my mother. I haven't been honest. Wait. that was a lie. Sorry, not being honest ig the truth, the parc about it being a lie wasn't the truth. I haven't told you \\x0c768 bbing and I We were Lovers. He slaps her.  You called off the relationship by pumping him full of lead.  No. The gun was for me. I was going to commit suicide. He used me, just wanted to make Lauren jeaious. Ryan, everything is in the past. Every new day is in the future. In fact, what I just said has now become the past. What I'm saying right now is the future, And now that sentence is in the... He's fully dressed.  e . confused Ah, good.  What do we do?  We act fast, or I'll be blamed for the assassination. He sees a sapers kit.  First I block their escape. You have the toughest job. Stay with them, Don't let them think anything is up. It's time we turned the tables on the other cheek.  0.C. Cass! A quick kiss and Cass goes off to Lauren and the ochers.     \\x0c79 Ryan sneaks out. A wind boathouse.     Ryan gets on the surfboard. Lifts the sail. A gust of wind blows him out to sea and over the horizon, completely out of sight in a micro second.   Ryan on surfboard coming back. Hits into the sub. Wearing a Hawaiian lei and straw hat. He's bewildered by what just occurred. But he's made it. He gets on the sub. From the saper bag he takes out a brick of plastique. He shapes it. Sticks it on the sub deck. Takes out a timer. Sticks it in the plastique. The plastique is really gooey, it acts like taffy. It sticks to his hand, and the timer, it gets all over. Trying to scrape it off with his feet, the explosive now sticks to his shoe, plus his chin. He sees the timer is counting down. Damn! He frantically attempts to shake it off, no good. Plastique and timer are stuck to his hand. Trying to scrape it off from hand to hand, it just gets worse. Down to . seconds. He manages to wad the stuff up in a big bail, and by closing the hatch, scrapes it off. It's now in the interior of the sub. At last! Ryan jumps into a Zodiac. He bounces back up on deck. Cripes! Gets in the Zodiac drives off just as     Sean, Lauren, Cass and the terrorists  the , and see the shock waves blow through the opened window, with the reddish hue of the explosion.  The sub! My U2 's!  We'll have to change our plans.  This place will be crawling with police. Out! Everyone grabs their gear and hustles out. Cass has a smug smile on her face.     A dozen news media, still photegraphers and video cameras take pictures of  Mc and . \\x0c88  This will be a very small photo op o ou reviewing the Hylander drill team and meeting with a local artist. Gestures to the Rockwell type artist. Mc Mayor Stopka, I'd be delighted of course. CU  Saber held in front of his face.  Aha hoy! Saber thrust forward. He marches. CU  We  the sound of the team, step, clump, step, clump. After a beat we see legs, then the gun butt hit onto the ground, step, gun butt, etc.    Coming toward us. Step, gun butt to ground, step, gun butt to  ground. We notice Ryan, in full kilted outfit, but his kilt is longer than the cthers, below the knees, very hip hop, very , he's in the middle of the group. He slams the gun butt on his own foot. It hurts. He reacts facially, Mm! The teams make a smart turn to the left. Placing Ryan over a grate. Air blows up his kilt. He has a heiluva time keeping modest.    Sean moves in among them. He favors his gun leg.    as the team, in smart turn, spin their guns around in front of themselves. Ryan spins the gun, and it goes out of his hand.  0.C. Aw! Ryan grabs the gun from the man next to him. The drill team spins their gums and brings chem up to their shoulders, slap the stock. \\x0c8  S  Lauren and Cass park among news vans.  on the side to blend in. They see Fergus, Orono and Bagley pull up. Lauren is concerned.     'S  An ear flops to the ground, courtesy of Ryan's bayonet. Ryans foot kicks it away.    Lined up. Camera is at the end of the line. We see the men spin the guns in front of themselves. A bit too close, Ryan slices off the bill of the caps on either side of him. The Sergeant steps into the .g., wounded from the bayonet stabbing earlier.  Eyo, tennnnhut! Guns at parade rest. As Ryan slams down his gun, it goes off. The Sergeant, hit, drops te the ground. It stuns and alerts everyone. The following happens lightning quick Fergus comes running.    Sees Fergus. Sees Sean open his leg, take out his gun. Ryan shoots at Sean, no bullets. He throws the gun and dives, knocking McKintyre over. Ending up knocking over the artist, his exhibits and his paints.    Is hit by the gun, it throws him off balance. Everyone sees the gun. They run. Fergus, Orono and Bagley see Sean. He shoots and misses at them. .  'S  She starts it up. Cass takes the keys. Runs out. Lauren shoots and misses her.    Gets to his feet. His face has been splashed with the exact facial markings of Mel Gibson in Braveheart. With the kilts, he looks like a Hyland warrior. Ryan has had enough. He has the fierce look of Clansmen. He lets out a war yell,  He shoves McKintyre into a van, Is joined by Cass. \\x0c82 Sean gets off more shorts. Fergus's cf bullets aimed at Ryan. Allowing to drive off. t c MecKintyre and    Pulls a news crewman from his van. Hops in. Drives at Fergus, Orone and Bagley. They dive out of the way. She picks up Sean. They drive off.    te his people Ryan did it, the man did it, and he needs us. Go!  'S  It's Ryan, the bloody bastard!  Shut up! Into her walkietalkie  Ducklings, plan B a ga. B a goi     Ryan's van driving fast. We see Lauren give up the pursuit. She takes off down an alley.  'S  Ryan's wiping the paint off his face with a rag. Mc Who are you?   Ryan Harrison. And this is a woman I've slept with. AssasSins are out to get you.  Everything will be fine, sir.     \\x0c 83 Sean pulls out of an alley. Blocks them off. Ryan hits the brakes. Throws it in reverse. A stinger from the roof blows up 4 van behind them. Ryan brings his van to a screeching halt. He's blocked!     Lauren, empty stinger in hand, and the terrorists rain automatic weapon fire at Ryan.    Our of car and opens fire.  'S  Ryan pulls the people from the burning van. Takes Cass and McKintyre into a van abandoned by a frightened man during the fire fight. He gets behind the wheel.  'S  2 The van is filled with carpoolers.  Its alright, I'll get us out of this. Can't get the thing started. Bullets riddle the windshield. He hits the wipers to clear away the glass. The engine Starts, but a stinger hits the hood. Fire everywhere. He hits the window spritzer. Backs up.   Terrorists pouring everything they have at the van.    Readies another stinger.  'S  2 A stinger on the way. Ryan rolls down the driver's and passenger's windows, leans back, the missile goes in and out the van. He backs up just as a van behind him is hit. He's blocked again. He carries everyone from the van, pulls the two people from the just hit van, and shoves everyone in to yet a third abandoned van. A flat! Bullets whizzing around. Ryan gets the spare tire. Starts to pump air into the oid ene. Too much gunfire. He gets in the van...that is Rit by 4 stinger.  S  3 \\x0c84 Ryan notices a receipt on the dashboard.  how dare they This is a rental. to the villains The bastardsiii!   Lauren and terrorists send a horrific barrage of fire.   Bullets kicking up everywhere. Ryan negotiates with a man on the street who has a For Sale sign on his van. They finally come to terms. Ryan carries everyone from van 3 into the new van 4. Starts it up. As he zigzags around, the van is hit, loses the roof. Hit again. Back half gone. Hit again. Entire body is gone. Hes down to a frame. Then it stalls. The gas gauge is empty. All seems lost.    Lauren calling down to Ryan.  This is the end, Ryan! Sean readies a stinger.  'S  Really jammed with people. Cass's head is just over his shoulder in a mess of arms, torsos and legs.  Mary Kelley. Let everyone go. Take me.  ,I really dont think we can get out, Ryan.  Damn!  You're so naive. So gullible. Do you know how stupid you are? \\x0c85  From one to ten?  No one but you could be framed for two crimes. You are such a fool.  I must be. I slept with both of your identities. It's chilly out here. You must have left your heart open.  Die! Ryan lays on top of Cass and everyone to protect them. Then we hear gunfire. But ne bullets are coming Ryan's way. He looks up.   Fergus, Orono, Bagley and a  team appear.    Drop the guns. The terrorists' guns are silenced but they still hold onto them.  . Give them up. They still hold them. Fergus, Orono and Bagley shoot at their feet to show them they mean business. Now what occurs vis. the terrorists and Lauren kick their feet to miss being hit by the bullets. But what it turns out looking like is the rousing, Celtic, feet flying finish of Riverdance. They drop their guns.    Pissed.  Not   Fergus tosses a terrorist's gun to Ryan. \\x0c86  'S  4 Ryan gets out. Catches the gun, rolls, comes up firing at Sean. A barrage of fire that lasts a long time, smoke, shells flying. Finally Sean grabs his shoulder.  I'm hit. He drops his gun. Puts his hands up. Fergus came down to the street and takes Sean into custody. Ryan opens the sliding door, everyone tumbles out. Cass ends up in his arms. MecKintyre at his feet. Cass hugs him. McKintyre, wobbly, gets te his feet.  Ryan Harrison, on behalf of all law enforcement, I say to the world, you were wrongfully accused. A big thumbs up to Ryan. Who gives a huge thumbs up. ..Ryan picks up Cass, swings her around, her feet catching McKintyre in the face. He's out cold. But Ryan is getting a nice hero's kiss.     We  the sound of a  that fills the night with power and beauty. A poster reads The Return Of Ryan Harrison The Wrongfully Accused Tour.   We cut to the black tie crowd, Fergus, Bagley and Orono all listen intently.    Cass is resplendent in a killer gown. She is so in love.    Ryan is magnificent. We read his music The I Love Cass, My New Wife, Symphony. Stirring performance, big time finish! And    They stand and applaud, as they had the first night.    \\x0caT The Orchestra stands and applauds.    Rise from wheelchairs. Toss away crutches.

They're right behind you.  Wow, you really know what's going on, don't you? He turns away and pretends to look at the chips. Doug gives him a thumbs up.

You know, they expire in two years.      Doug and Steve watch Grieco's Ferrari drive off as they sit on the car and eat Pork Rinds.  That nabob has got it going on.  sadly envious Kickin' it at the Roxbury, rollin' a banana Ferrari.  Tasty geisha by his side.  The man is a bag of chips.  correcting him All that and a bag of chips.  Right. Well, we're doing okay. I got a number tonight.  thrilled Let me see it! Steve hands him a cocktail napkin. Doug reads it.  555...? Steve, this isn't real. It's one of those fake T.V. numbers.  Is not.  Is, too. I get this number all the time.  At least she respected me enough to write a fake number. We'll get a real one one of these days.  One of these days? Steve, don't you get it? These are our days. Now! Today! Ahora!  Ah whatta? Doug jumps off the car, starts pacing.  Steve, we're young. We're supposed to purge ourselves of the party virus or we'll just get so clogged up that when we're like forty we'll just explode.  Yeah, like one of those individual plastic butters you get in the diner. You know, like when you squish it, just bursts out all over the place. Steve makes explosion sound.  Forget the butter, Steve. I'm trying to explain   interrupting Or like when you put an egg in a microwave and all the yellow stuff flies out. He mimes exploding egg.  That's an exceptional way to visualize it but listen to me.  Oh! Remember in camp when we put that can of beans in the fire?  And it exploded. Yes. Steve! If we're ever going to live up to our full potential, we've got to get this partying out of our systems now.  Let's do it. They both get in the car.      Alright, let's do it! Do it! Woo!  ... Do what? Everything's closed. Beat.  Then let's go home.  excited Let's go home! Wooo!      The house is a bad '80s combination of classical styles.

He picks up a watering pot, tips it on a plant  nothing comes out.  You know what I just did?  3 What?  I just watered your plant for a whole year.

So, I guess you're back from school and working in the lamp store again.  Yeah, I missed you.  Pardon me. I got to talk to my brother a second. Doug pulls Steve aside.  What, do you like her or something?  No.  Then why are you talking to her?  She's talking to me.  Steve, look at me. It is your destiny to be with a variety of lady girls. Not just one lamp store troll. And quite frankly, your level of looks is way above her level of looks. So for her own good, just walk away.  You are so smart.  That's why I'm here.  So, Steve, you gonna ask me out 'cause I think we could have a really good time...  Yeah, that sounds good. Doug annoyed, steps between them.  Back off, chicklet!  What's your problem. Doug?  Emily, I don't know if you know this, but my brother and I? We live life in the fast lane. That means no stop signs, no red lights, and no pulling over to take pictures.

You murder me.  as he walks away ... salesmen. That's great. Emily waves goodbye to Steve.  Dad, can you just leave Steve alone? .  What? Your brother likes the girl.  No, he doesn't.  No, I don't.  Dad, nothing personal, but Emily's like a pigwoman from a planet of pig people. And she's trying to take Steve on her porky little spaceship so she can take him back to the Planet Pig!  Hey, Doug, you know what they eat on the Pig Planet? Bacon and sausage.  laughing Nice call. They high five.  Every once in a while I'll hit pay dirt. .  This is all too bad, because that girl is going to be his wife.  No, she's not.  to Doug You know, they could also eat ham. .  Enough of pig talk. Doug, do you see this wall?

She opens and closes her legs, notices them.  What? They look back up and walk away.  O.S. Tommeee! Steve raises his hand to high five a bodybuilder, who ignores them.  O.S. Catch you later.     A huge muscle guy is looking in the mirror as he pumps a barbell. Doug and Steve step over. This is the first time we see them, in their gym attire  tight Spandex pants, mesh tank tops and giant weight belts.  Excuse me, can the rest of us use the mirror? The muscle guy moves over. Doug picks up a small dumbbell. Steve spots.  pumps it How's my form?  Looking good.

We actually had a long talk about that the other night.  I just don't want you to cheat yourselves. I'm sorry I had to come down on you like this, but in a weird way, that's my job.  Hey, that's why we love you and we hate you.  Still friends?  You know it.  I'm glad we had this talk.  Hey, we don't talk, we do. They all nod.     A very fit  stands on a ministage.

Simultaneously, they go right back into their manical dance. . Everyone but Doug and Steve stop. People stare at them. They continue in silence, then slowly wind down as they notice people staring.  Alright! Yeah!  Cardiofunk!  Thank you, Shelley! Shelley stares at them. After a few uncomfortable beats.  ... what's up?      Doug and Steve simultaneously put on their sunglasses.  Should we go back to work?  Probably.  What do you want to do?  We shaked it, let's bake it. They walk off.      Guys drive along highway in . Ocean on one side. Steve stares off at the ocean.  Water.  Where?  There. Doug turns.  Right.     We see Steve and Doug, waist up. They have lotion caked up unevenly on themselves.  You know, I told Dad we should put some ferns and some silk banana trees in front of the store. 'Cause then passersby and the like could see 'em and we could attract more customers.  unsure what he just heard Moonwalk that by me again?  I just said I was talking to Dad about the store and...  The store? You're sitting around thinking about the store?  Yeah.  Why?  That's where we work.  exploding That's right. And is that all you want to do with your life?

That is so sweet of you.  I know. And you deserve better. You deserve to get into the Roxbury.  Doug, there's a list. You have to be like a Richard Grieco type guy.  Steve, we are the Richard Grieco type guys. We should be on that list. We're 'A' club people leading a 'B' club life.  We've been going to 'B' Clubs? Why didn't you ever tell me this?  I didn't want to hurt your feelings. I know how sensitive you are.  'Cause we settle. 'Cause we keep going to all those 'B' clubs ever night They can smell 'B' club on us like barf in a bathroom. From now on, the only club we go to is the Roxbury.  But, how   But, nothing.  We can't   We can. And we will. Because no matter how many lists and roped off areas the big bouncer in the sky throws in front of us, we will get through. You know why?  We're goodlooking?  Very goodlooking. You especially. Now, repeat after me.  'After me.' Sorry. I'm just kidding.  completely serious And it was hysterical. I'm just not laughing to preserve the drama of the previous moment.  Understood. Continue.  Repeat after me. We can get in the Roxbury.  We can get into the Roxbury.  Roxbury! Roxbury! Roxbury! They leap up and down. Two girls walk by. They immediately stop.  What's up?      Mr. Butabi, Mrs. Butabi, Fred Anderson, , Fred's middle America wife, and Emily are having coffee in the living room. Emily is obviously dressed up to attract Steve. .  midconversation ... And then, and I swear this is true, someone came into the store today and thought it was a real plant store.  No? .  I would not kid about that. Doug and Steve burst in, still in their black Gucci G strings, head up the stairs. .  Hello? Doug and Steve turn.  Hey.  What's up? .  The Andersons here. Get dressed and come join us.  Okay.  Steve! Sorry, Dad, we're busy tonight.  I like your bathing suit, Steve.  Thanks Emily.  Steve, again!  I mean, whatever, Emily.  Nice to see you, folks. The guys rush upstairs. Suddenly, we hear  pounding from their room. .  Excuse me a minute. Mr. Butabi goes upstairs.  'S    The guys are picking out their clothes in the closet Mr. Butabi enters and shuts off the . .  If I tell you to do something, you do it. And what is this business of coming in naked. Put on your pants and come down.  Ain't on our 'Things to do' list. Daddyo. Steve and I have something extremely important to do tonight. .  Yes, to come downstairs.  Dad! Doug goes in their bathroom and slams the door. .  Why can I not get through to him?  Dad, Doug is like a fax machine. You just keep putting things in, face down, and you need to have a cover page, because if you don't  people don't know where it's coming from and sometimes you don't get through on the first call. That's why you got a redial button and a memory button because... you know... actually, I never use those buttons. I always screw it up. I don't know. Doug opens the bathroom door.  to Steve Don't try to explain it to him. He'll never understand. .  Oh, I understand. You are going out tonight.  That's right. .  I just don't understand what you're driving. Mr. Butabi takes their keys off the dresser and grabs their cell phones and starts to exit.  Hey! Dad! What are you doing! Mr. Butabi exits.     Emily is standing, singing Memories from Cats. Everyone is listening.  'Memories, all alone in the moonlight...' Fred nods isn't she good to Kamehl, who agrees. Steve and Doug, dressed to kill, stomp down the stairs. Doug turns to Mr. Butabi.  You can take away our phones. You can take away our keys. But, you can't take away our dreams!  That's right. 'Cause we're like sleeping when we have them.  Later much. The guys exit. Steve pauses a moment.  Emily, nice voice.  O.S. Steve! Steve exits.      Mrs. Butabi runs after them, holding old bricksized cell phones. .  Boys! Boys! The guys stop. .  I don't like you going out without a phone. What if something happens? She hands them the cell phones.  Ma, these are embarrassing. .  Take it in case of emergency. She kisses them and walks back in.  Did Ma get lipstick on me?  Yeah, but it looks like you were making out.  Oh, good. In b.g., Mom gets knocked over by Great Danes. No one notices.   .   We see the van driving down the street.     Doug Pulls down sun visor, checks his hair. Tries rear view mirror  still good. Then leans across Steve, who's driving, and looks in the driver's side view mirror  still good.  Steve, how's my hair?  Looks good.  Roxbury good?  You know it. How do I look?  Robust and attractive. I gotta tell you  tonight, I can taste it. Steve doesn't respond and suddenly  the . Doug gets thrown forward.  completely losing it I can't taste it, Doug! I can't! I'm so scared right now I don't know what to do!  calming him down Bro, you're mad cowing on me. Relax.  I'm nervous, man. We've put all this pressure on ourselves to get into the Roxbury, and I don't know if we can deliver!  You gotta take control of yourself.  No, you gotta take control! I am barely hanging on here!... You... Steve starts crying. Doug cradles him.  Whoa... settle down... relax... think puppies and candy canes... easy... Doug notices two girls walking by the van.  What's up?  completely recovered How you doing, little lady? From O.S., a beer  flies  at them and  on the van.  Alright. Maybe later then.  Doug, I see your Roxbury balloon, and I hate to be the one to burst it. I just don't think our names are on that list.  Steve, get real. The bouncer isn't checking a list. He's checking us. Man, I can't believe all this time, that's what you thought.  So, why didn't we ever get in before?  We were kids. We were completely immature.  But that was last night. And now we don't even have our car.  Perfect. Rites of passage. Like that Africa show on P.B.S. When it's time for a boy to become a man, they send him to the jungle with nothing but a spear to hunt the lion The van is our spear and the Roxbury is our lion. And when the hunt is over, we shall be men.  Does the bouncer know about this?  Look, Steve, what really matters is that at the end of the night  when all is said and done and all hotties have been hit upon  if either of us has just one girl's number, just one, then we'll know, for the first time in our lives, we're really worth something.     The guys pull up  get out. Steve tosses Doug the keys. Doug tosses the keys to the valet  who ignores them. Keys fall to the ground. Doug runs over, picks up keys  hands them to the valet. Walks back to Steve.  Storm the castle.  Take no prisoners. Doug and Steve try to walkbop up to the Bouncer. They wave to people who aren't there, trying to act cool, and attempt to walk in. Bouncer stops them.  Hey, my good hombre, remember us from last night?  No.  Doug and Steve Butabi.  You're brothers?  No... Yes!  Works every time. They laugh hysterically.  Now, I remember. You can't come in. A flashy guy walks past them, in , slapping a fifty dollar bill into the Bouncer's hand and entering.  aside to Steve Okay, it's time to play a little softball.  Hello, my good man. How's it going tonight?  Good. You're still not getting in.  Well, that's not what a good friends of mine told me. Maybe you know him? His name is Abraham. Doug drops a five dollar bill on the Bouncer's clipboard. The Bouncer doesn't move.  You don't know him?  How 'bout his two friends? George Washington and... George Washington? Steve drops two onedollar bills. The Bouncer doesn't move.  Let's not forget the other boy in the band, Mr. Hamilton. He's a little lonely, wants to join his buddies.  holds out a ten. He waves it up and down, sideways, drops it, but the Bouncer still doesn't respond.  Wait up, look what we got here... Steve reaches into his pocket, pulls out some change, starts dropping coins.  Mr. Jefferson, Jefferson, Lincoln...  ...Roosevelt, Roosevelt, Roosevelt, Roosevelt, and a commemorative coin  '84 Olympics  what a proud chapter in Angelino history. The Bouncer looks down and turns his clipboard over, dropping all the money to the ground.  guys' reaction...      The van stops and starts as they look out the window.  There's one! Steve stops. They look out.  That's not an A.T.M. That's where you drop off your videos.  Wait, there's one! Steve stops short. They look out.      We see a yellow  into the back of the flower van.      The guys are thrown forward. All the plants are thrown on top of them.      Richard Grieco is driving the other car,  with him.  Oh, shit! The car.  Car? What about me?  No, this car is illegal. All I need is a police report.  What do you mean?  It's a racing car. I imported it illegally. The guys slowly get out of their van, dazed, dragging plants as they get out.  You okay?  Let me see... Doug slowly bops his head, feeling if there's anything loose.  Ah, great. They're starting in with the neck injuries. I'm screwed. Both guys check if their heads still work. Grieco comes over.  Hey, sorry about your car.  No way. Richard Grieco!  Remember, we saw you last night? Grieco nods, unsure, but agreeable.  To Richard Like Walt Disney says, my man, 'It's a small world after it all.'  So, are you guys alright?  My neck hurts.  re cars Right, so, what do you want to do?  We were just going to the Roxbury again.  But we couldn't get in.  Hey, you guys want me to get you in the Roxbury?  Yeah!  Great. Follow me. Grieco goes back to his car.  This is amazing.  See? It all comes from within. And he felt it. Because he's an actor and he's very sensitive. The guys get back in the van.   Put in 'D' and blast me. Steve shoots Binaca spray into Doug's mouth and shifts. 'S   Grieco is driving.  We got to make a stop at the Roxbury.  What about the party?  I don't want a lawsuit, okay?      Richard Grieco walks with the Blonde Model, Steve and Doug trailing behind, walking past a huge line of club goers. Steve starts breathing heavy  he's nervous.  Steve, keep it together. Think FRA. Focus, rhythm, attitude.  Got it... Fra. They all reach the entrance.  Mr. Grieco. Nice to see you.  I got two.  to Bouncer That's right. We're with Richard Grieco.  to line of people That's right. Grieco!      Red velvet curtains. Steve and Doug push through the curtains and are stunned. 'S  Beautiful, sexy, expensively dressed people mill around.  Oh my God, Doug, this is the most amazing place I've ever been.  Hey guys! This is the coat room. The club's in here. The guys follow Grieco.     The guys enter with Grieco. . Long, crowded bar, oddshaped velvet couches, model types are Velcroed to the walls, huge crowded dance floor. This is it.  stunned ...Sweet. The guys follow Grieco, greeting passing women.  Whats' up?  What's up?... faster What's up, what's up, whats' up, what's up, what's up...  Steve! Get a hold of yourself.  Sorry, it's hottie overload in here.  Pace yourself.  counting to himself ... What's up?... two, three... What's up? . , the club owner, 45, Armani suit, magnanimously greets them, holding a drink  he speaks with a foreign accent. .  Richard, my man! Good to see you.  Benny. Place is kickin'. .  Actually, it's jumping. Like '21 Jump Street,' right? Ha! to Steve and Doug My children watch the reruns on T.V. land. to Grieco Who are your friends?  Oh, guys, this is Mr. Zadir. He owns this place. These are uh..  Doug Butabi.  Steve Butabi. .  Let me show you my V.I.P. table. They follow Zadir through the crowd. As they walk...  aside to Steve Oh my God! The owner.  I know!  He's the man who pulls the strings. The Gepetto of party.  Plus, he's the owner.  Sh! Listen and learn, my friend. They arrive at a table overlooking the dance floor. .  waving to someone O.S. Yes! I see you! Excuse me, I have to say hello to Bob Saget. Mr. Zadir exits.  So, you guys come here a lot?  Yeah, all the time.  But, we're never been inside. Grieco and his date look at each other.  aside Steve, what are you saying, be cool. to Grieco So, is Johnny Depp meeting you here or what?  No. So you guys look like you really know how to party.  Oh, yeah, we never stop.  We're pretty much out of control. Mr. Zadir returns, shouting behind him. .  to Bob O.S. I get it, Bob, the club is crowded, so it's a 'Full House' like your show. to Richard He's too much. Grieco and his date start to get up.  Benny, we'll see you at the party. I'll see you guys.  See ya. Richard Grieco!  To Blonde Their necks looked alright, right? Grieco and Blonde exit. A waiter puts a bottle of champagne on the table and Zadir begins to pour glasses  he's obviously had a few.  Sir, I just want to say, and I mean this with the utmost sincerity, it is an honor to shoot the shit with the owner of the club of all clubs.  Yeah, and we're proficient club hoppers  so we know what we're talking about. .  Thank you.  I mean, we usually go this place called 'The Palace' and that place is rank. The music is ancient.  Yeah, no celeb citings and the women are oinkers.  And they let any asswad in the door. It's the worst. .  I own that place also.  Yeah, but it's a really good location.  And the drinks are reasonably priced. .  No, no. You are right. That's what's wrong with this club business. One day you are hot next day you are not. People get bored easily.  Well, you know I had this great idea. You should make this place like a tropical jungle.  Yeah, lots of silk plants and vines.  Yeah, but they're not real vines. They're bungee cords and people could like swing from one end to the other so if you left your friends at the bar, you could get back to them. Mr. Zadir is half listening to them as he drinks.  Yeah, and the barmaids could wear loincloths  but tasteful. Like the ones they wear in strip clubs. .  You could not insure bungee cords. People jumping back and forth. Too expensive.  Okay. Hit delete on that one. Doug, tell him about your street idea.  I was just thinking, you know how people get bummed waiting outside to get in the club. Zadir nods, listening to this one.  This is good. You're gonna love this.  Well, you make the outside of the club look like the inside. You know, you put down a rug outside and some couches and pipe out some music. People will love it. But, then on the inside.  Oh, this is the good part.  ... Looks like the street. You know, you park some cars inside, a mailbox, street signs, and that way when they come in, it's like the outside is the inside and inside is the outside.  Doesn't that blow your mind? .  It hurts my brain to think about it.   and , predatory model types, scope out the place.  What about that guy?  He owns a restaurant.  How many?  One.  Uch. How'd he get in?  annoyed ... Look, I don't see anything over six figures... So, let's just go. Vivica stabs out her cigarette, begins to pack up.  Wait a second. That's that Zadir guy. Vivica looks up. .  laughing and drinking champagne.  and  Too bad he's married. He owns all the clubs in town. Plus, dry cleaners, that beeper service, and Mailboxes, Etc...  Who are those guys with him? Cambi reaches into her purse and pulls out Money magazine's richest people issue.  I can't find them, but if they're with Zadir, they've got to be worth something.  Great. Let's work.  The guys are pitching Zadir another idea,  comes over.  Oh my God! Benny! Benny! Benny! Benny! .  Gilbert Gottfried, who let you in?  You have to say hello to my friend at the other table. Not this table. No. No. The other one. Looks like this table  other people around it. I have a friends and he needs you to say hello to him at the other table. .  You have a friend?  Oh my God! You got me! I didn't see it coming. No. It was coming but I was not able to see it. .  I better go before he explodes. Gilbert and Zadir walk away.  nervous Was I too pushy? I was too pushy. Did I speak well?  You were totally articulate.  Maybe he didn't like our ideas. It's hard to pitch in a night club. You ever notice, the music is blasting in here. We should try to get a meeting. Steve starts looking off at something, mesmerized.  So, Steve, what if we... Doug sees what Steve is watching. He also becomes mesmerized.  In , like two cars, the girls saunter across the dance floor, toward Steve and Doug.  and  even more mesmerized.  even closer.  still staring at the girls. The girls walk up to them.  on automatic Up what's? You want to dance?  Yes.  Steve, she said 'Yes.'  What?  amazed Hotties want to shake it, come on.  Steve and Doug surround the girls and frenetically gyrate, pushing into them. The girls escape and Steve and Doug end up slam dancing against each other.  Hey, guys! Over here. Cambi takes Doug's hand. Vivica grabs Steve's hand. This is Your Night by  starts. The following is a perfectly choreographed dance to the music. The girls dance seductively, dancing toward the boys. Doug and Steve, unsure what's going on, look at each other. Simultaneously, the girls start to mimic the girls' moves. The boys do some hand jive, the girls match them perfectly. They begin a variety of dips, swings and techno style dances. They're incredible. The crowd watches them... Doug and Steve start doing some moves together. An impressed  comes over to them. John adds his own movements and the guys follow suit. John, Steve, Doug, and the girls do a synchronized dance. . Crowd cheers.  to Travolta Bro, you are incredible!  Seriously, unbelievable stuff out there. So, you want to hang out?  No. Travolta starts to exit.  Alright, catch you later then.  I don't think so.      Mr. Zadir's black limo is driving.     Doug, Steve, Mr. Zadir, Vivica and Cambi are inside. Zadir pops open a bottle of Dom Perignon and starts pouring.  Wow, 1980, good year!  Oh, '80 was an excellent year. Devo had a big hit that year.  Yeah, and 'Joanie loves Chachie' started that year.  That was just a cheap spinoff.  That was a spinoff?  Of course, those characters originated on 'Happy Days.'  I did not know that.  Sure, 'Joanie Loves Chachi.' But, does Chachi give a Fuck about Joanie? .  Cambi makes a good po But tonight we should have fun, not dwell on Scott Baio.  drinking Sweet suds, Mr. Zadir.  Dom Perignon's good but you know what really makes a party  Redi Whip.  But not like when you put it on stuff. It's when you're half pressing on that little white nozzle and like before it comes out, you suck on it, and it's really fun.  You mean like nitrous oxide? Whippets?  taken aback ... No!  dumbfounded Tscha! What is that? Mr. Zadir lowers the panel between the driver and the rear. .  to driver Dooey! We must stop and get Redi Whip! , 35, black suit and tie, looks in a rearview mirror .  Yes, sir. Zadir raises the panel.  to Dooey But it has to be Redi Whip in a can! .  Wait, he can't hear you. Zaidir lowers the panel, nods to Steve.  I was just saying it has to be Redi Whip in a can.  annoyed Right. Zadir raises the panel.  He really can't hear us? .  No.  Dooey, tell your mother I had a really good time last night!  And your father!  What?  I mean your sister!  Good one. The guys high five. Cambi and Vivica exchange looks of disbelief. Dooey lowers the panel.  Mr. Zadir, I'm pulling over here to get whipped cream.   711  Dooey pulls over and gets out. Doug looks out the window. 'S  He watches Dooey talking to the cash register person.  I'll be right back. Doug gets out.   711  Dooey hands the cash register person a credit card, who swipes it. Doug rushes in.  I'll take care of it. Doug grabs the phone.  Operator 238, please... What's up?      It's the same Switchboard Operator he talked to at the store. The following conversation is ...  resigned Hello, Doug.  Guess where we went tonight?  Let me see, the 711 on Ventura?  No, I mean, before this, you sly little credit vixen.  Doug!  The Roxbury with Richard Grieco and Bob Saget. You gotta come out sometime.  I would. But then there'd be no one to approve all the money you spend.  You're always thinking of me.  The card's good. 'Bye, Doug. She hangs up. Doug hands the phone back.  She approved.      Modern style house. Lights dot a gravel driveway that leads to the entrance. The limo drives up.  V.O. Sweet ass cottage, Mr. Zadir.  'S A . Spice Girls are performing. A pool with a waterfall is the center of the party. People are dancing, drinking, swimming, etc.  opens. Doug, Steve, Mr. Zadir and the girls enter.  Mr. Zadir, I am very impressed. For a guy who owns sleazy night clubs, the decor in your house is quite tasteful.  Good one. The guys nod to each other, proud of their compliment.  Excuse us, we're going to the ladies' room. The girls walk off. Mr. Zadir notices something. .  Anna Nicole! Put something on! You are making us sick! Mr. Zadir walks away.  Do you feel it, Steve? We are finally experiencing the party lifestyle to the fullest degree. Let's mingle. They walk over to a Fabio type .  How's it hanging? You want to mingle?  Cool party, huh?  who the hell are these guys ... I guess.  Yeah, I'd say it's kicking into gear right about... Steve and Doug pause a moment. Model Guy looks at each of them.  ... now.  So, what do you do?  I'm a model.  Oh, right. So are we.  It's a hard job.  Yeah, you know, like you got to stand still all the time and uh...  racking his brain ... Standing still. Standing still is really hard. My foot cramps sometimes.  I know what you mean. What agency you with? Elite, Ford?  Uh huh.  to Model So, do you like mingling?  Excuse me. The Model Guy walks away.  Nice guy.  off at Model Guy See you on the shoot! As they start eating their pasta primavera again, a  emerges from the pool and walks directly towards them. Steve and Doug forget how to chew and stand, stunned.  Can you pass me a towel, please? They talk directly to her breasts, trying to be nonchalant, but answering questions she hasn't asked.  Good. How are you?  ... about eight o'clock, eight fifteen.  They're right behind you. Can you just reach over?  Thanks. All the time.  Sagittarius. .  Right off Sunset.  Vanilla mostly. She shoves by them and exits. Mr. Zadir comes over. .  Look at this, I have the Spice Girls, yet nobody is dancing. The guys snap out of it.  With all due partythrowing respect, you know what the problem is, Mr. Zadir? This pool is taking up all the prime dancing real estate.  Yeah, you know, if there were a big piece of glass you could put over the pool, you could use it as a dance floor. And it would be really sweet because people would feel like they were dancing on water.  And you could put fish in the water and it would be like the ocean.  Or, Doug, you know what would be another amazing idea? You could have a special room for people who want to dance naked.  Plus, then you could have a room next to that room with a oneway mirror so other people could watch them. .  calming them down Boys, boys, please let's not talk business. We'll schedule a meeting for this. Guys silentlyjoyously high five their meeting. Cambi, Vivica enter.  There you are.  We got scared.  protective Of who? We'll kick his ass.  No, we got scared someone stole you away from us. Doug and Steve ponder the meaning of this statement for a beat, having rarely heard a compliment.  realizes it's a compliment Oh... to Steve Like some other girls would steal us away.  Oh, right... Oh!  Mr. Zadir, would you mind if we borrowed them for a while? .  Yes... They all look at him. .  ... No! laughs Got you!  Good one, Mr. Zadir.  He totally got me.  Mr. Zadir, let me just say that you, sir, are a load and a half. .  laughing Thank you, Doug! The guys and girls exit.      The guys are entertaining the girls with their killer impression of Hall  Oates.  singing ... Oh, oh, here she comes... The guys do a here she comes step.  Watch out, boy, she'll chew you up. Doug chews.  Whoa, here she comes...  She's a maneater! The girls look blankly at them. The guys stop.  Guess who that was?  I have no idea.  Well, I was supposed to have a moustache.  Sonny and Cher?  Okay, we'll give you another h The guys get into their Hall and Oates positions.  singing She's a rich girl.  singing And she's going to go far 'cause she knows it doesn't matter anyway. Cambi stands.  shutting them up Guys, guys! I have an idea. You want to have some fun?  Sure, fun is our last name.  Plus, fun spelled backwards is 'nuf.' And you can never have 'nuf' fun.  takes Steve by the hand Great. Let's go.  Where we going?  They're staying in here. And we're going in there. Vivica pulls Steve into an adjoining guest bedroom.  as the door shuts Steve!  Doug!     Vivica sits on the bed. Steve awkwardly stands by the door.  Nice room.  Yeah, it's great. yelling at door Doug, you should check out this room!  I think he's busy.  I'm just a big believer in sharing. Vivica sensually lies back on the bed, staring at Steve. Steve is uncomfortable, starts walking around.  Steve, why don't you come over here? Vivica pats the bed a few times, inviting him over. Steve watches. Thinks. Then goes over to the bed and also pats it a few times, turning it into a drum solo.  stopping him Steve! Steve stops, looks at her.  Viv, you know what I heard when I first met you?  What? Steve starts making a very loud inappropriate shrill ambulance siren sound  over and over.  What are you doing? Steve stops.  That's an ambulance. Coming to take me away because the sight of you just stopped my heart. Steve is very proud of his comment, and makes another siren sound.      Doug is sitting next to Cambi, trying to think of something to say.  trying to be suave So, Cambi, can I ask you something? Do you like blueberries or strawberries? .  Why?  I want to know what type of pancakes to order you in the morning. He looks proud of his line as we begin to hear Steve O.S.  from the next room  making more , over and over.  You know, I was wondering... snaps, annoyed at siren sound Steve!  O.S. stops siren sound ... Sorry!  I was wondering... Doug starts looking at Cambi's shirt label.  What are you doing?  Checking your label. Just as I thought. Made in heaven.  Doug, you've gotten past the opening line.  Hey, is that a mirror in your pocket?  What?  'Cause I can see myself in your pants.  Hey, Doug, if I said you had a nice body, would you hold it against me?  confused What?      Steve and Vivica sitting on the bed.  And this guy on the phone turns around and he tips his hat like this. Doug does a tip your hat motion.  And who do you think the guy was? Vivica is bored.     . Doug is telling Cambi the same story.  And Steve was like 'Emilioooo!'      Steve is telling the story.  ... Emilioooo!      Doug still telling story.  Emilioooo! And it was really him.  Is this your first time?  What? Oh my God. That is hilarious. That is so hilarious! yelling at the door Steve, did you hear that? to Cambi You don't even know how funny that is. You are funny. You don't even know how funny you are! Man! Cambi pounces on Doug with a kiss.      Vivica is inches away from Steve's mouth.  Vivica, I've been thinking. Our relationship is really going strong now. We've had some great times together that I'll never forget. Remember when I saw you at the pool?  Yeah?  So, I was just remembering back. sighs You know, an open dialogue is an essential element to any successful long term relationship. I think we have something special going on here and I don't want to move too fast.  Is this your first time?  Yes. Isn't it yours? Vivica smiles and pounces on Steve, knocking him .      The bedroom doors simultaneously open. Doug and Steve excited, run into the hallway.  Doug, oh my god!  Oh my God! Did you just? 'Cause I just!  This is unbelievable!  This is historical! This what it's all about! Up Top! They highfive. Doug suddenly catches himself, changes back to cool attitude  Steve follows.  Not that it hasn't happened before.  Of course not.  I mean it was alright.  The usual. They stand there, posing cool, but awkward for a beat.  I'm gonna go back in the   Me, too. I'll see you later. They run back in the bedrooms.      Mr. Zadir's limo pulls up. Doug and Steve get out, shut door. Car drives off. The guys stand in place, in reverie.  Hey, Steve?  Yeah, Doug.  That was great.  I know. Are we A club people now? Doug looks at him  then to answer, he pulls out a small piece of paper, shows it to Steve.  You got a number! Wooo!  Woo! We got a number! They jump up and down, embracing, happy as hell.   'S    Doug is working feverishly at his desk. There are phone books, rolodex, staplers, notepads in front of him. Steve enters with a shopping bag.  Where have you been? We've got to get ready for our business meeting with Mr. Zadir?  I got some great new supplies for our business. Steve starts pulling items out of the bag, Doug doesn't pay attention.  'Post Its' to annotate important documents. 'Little Post Its' 'cause you write smaller than me. 'While you were out' pads  for while you are out. Scotch tape, in case the Post Its lose their adhesiveosity. And mugs with our names on them. Yours says, 'Doug.' Doug turns around.  Okay, here's what we're gonna do.  interrupting Did you call Mr. Zadir?  Steve, before you talk to a man like Mr. Zadir, you have to have a fully developed plan of attack. You have to have all your ducks in row.  I didn't know to get ducks.  That's an expression.  So, we're going back to the dance club idea?  Yeah. Now you set up the office. I'm gonna call some real estate people to talk about locations. At that point, I'd like to schedule a meeting. Can you do tweleve thirty. Doug checks his Filofax. Steve unwraps a new Filofax and starts looking through it.  I'm clear.  Great. Be prepared to discuss possible club names and themes.  What about music?  We'll have to schedule another meeting for that. Hey, you know what? Maybe we should have a pre meeting to brainstorm before our scheduled meeting.  Yeah. That way we won't look like idiots at our meeting.  Exactly. Okay, I'm gonna roll a few calls. We should order in.  I can take care of that. to door Ma! Doug pulls out the phone, starts dialing. Steve starts organizing the desk.  Hey, Steve?  Yeah?  I was just thinking. Dad would really be proud of us right now. They both smile. Mrs. Butabi enters. .  Boys, your father's furious. You were supposed to be at work an hour ago.  Alright, we're gonna have to do some rescheduling.     Doug, behind cash register, holding clipboard, on the phone.  Yes, hello, I'm interested in your sound systems. I've heard good things about your woofers and tweeters. Steve walks over.  Doug, I...  I'm on a call. Steve nods, knowing what to do. He pulls a PostIt, writes something down and sticks it on Doug's clipboard. A  walks up with a small plant. Doug puts a Register Closed sign on the counter. The Lady leaves and we  her  Mr. Butabi.  Mr. Butabi, where is the other cash register? . 'S  Cash register. There are several PostIts stuck to the counter. Steve is filling out another one. .  I'll be with you in a second, Mrs. Manicotti. Mr. Butabi goes over to the cash register.  One second, Dad. .  It's good to see you're on a break. I mean, after all, you've been here almost twenty minutes now and it's hard work listening to your walking man and ringing up the one customer you've had.  Dad, I'm sensing a note of sarcasm. .  This is a very nice sign. Except for one thing. exploding This is the only register! This is why I pay you  to push a button and take the money. Is that too much? Is there some problem I don't know about? Did you injure your button pushing finger in a bad cell phone accident?  Dad, why don't you go to Rexall's Drug Store. I think you need to purchase a bottle of chill pills. .  Just when I thought I had you doing the absolute minimum, you astound me with how much less you can do.  For your information, Dad, we are working our asses off.  Yeah, our week's filling up pretty quick.  Dad, last night, Steve and I happen to have made a very important business contact. .  Oh, what are you dancing the Macarena with Donald Trump?  Did you want me to go the drug store to get those pills?  I think we should tell him now. excited Dad, you're gonna love this. We're working on this club idea which could include many silk plant opportunities and guess who we thought could be our supplier? .  Yes, I need you to give me opportunities. I feed you, I clothe you, I put a roof over your head and I pay for your little phones so you can call other idiots. I give up on you two. I am ashamed to call you my sons.  There you go again, Dad. You always tell us to do something with our lives and when we finally do, what happens? You got to put us down. You never support us, you never encourage us, and you never care about what's important to us. Right, Steve?  Do you need a prescription for those pills? .  It's my own fault. I spoil you. From now on, you are no longer allowed to go out to clubs at night.  What? .  Now enough wasting time. Go clean up the stock room.  You know what, Poppason, not only will Steve and I not clean the stock room, but we are officially out of here! to Steve Come on. Doug starts walking out.  But what about the stock room?  We quit! turns back to Dad And we don't need you! We made big contacts last night!  Yeah, plus we met these girls, Dad, and you wouldn't believe what happened.  to Dad We're gonna make it without you. You'll see. Doug exits, Steve follows him. .  Yes, I'll see tonight when you get hungry and you come home to eat my food. And when you come crawling to me for more money!      Doug and Steve barrel out the front door and head straight for the van. Emily, in a sexy sun dress, carrying two big huge oversized lightbulbs where her breasts would be, steps in front of them.  Hey, Steve! Do you want to go to the beach later? I've got my bathing suit on under this.  to Emily Not now! Doug blows by Emily. Beat. He steps back   takes a second look at the odd bulb positions  and exits again. The guys start getting into the van.  I'm not talking to you, Doug. You're an ass.  Emily, we're experiencing a major family crisis. I'm gonna have to take a rain check on this convo.  Steve! Car!  as he gets into the car Nice bulbs, Emily. Steve gets in. They .  yells after them So, you want to go out tonight?      The guys speed along on their way to Butabi. Doug is looking over a sheet of paper.  Okay, these are the ideas we'll pitch him. The Jungle Paradise.  Killer.  The Inside Out Club.  Money.  The Civil War.  That one needs work.  Yeah. We'll hold off on that one. And let's not forget our ace in the hole  The Naked Room.  I think we should call it 'The Nudist Colony.'  That sounds like a strip club. And this is a dance club.  You're right. We'll go with 'The Naked Room.'   'S  The silk van drives up. Steve and Doug get out and walk up to the locked gate.  Zadir's gonna be excited to see us. This is it, bro... Doug presses the intercom. They wait.  This is it. Doug presses the intercom buzzer again. No response. As they wait, Steve starts to sing to himself.  very softly 'This is it, make your mistakes where you are. This is it...' We realize Steve is singing This Is It by Kenny Loggins. Doug slowly joins in as they pass the time.  '... We're going no further.' The both step singing as Doug hits the buzzer again. After a beat of waiting, Steve picks up the song where they left off...  soloing much louder 'Here! The moment is now, no place for goodbyes...'  Male voice starts singing the next lyric.  V.O. 'And now I'm not so sure... doo doo... deep in my heart...'  V.O. This is it!  They stop singing.  V.O. You guys know 'Footloose'?  running to intercom Actually, we're here to see Mr. Zadir. It's Steve and Doug Butabi.  softly to himself '... pick up your Sunday shoes...'  V.O. Mr. Zadir's not here.  We were supposed to have a meeting with him about our ideas. Like there's one where the inside is outside and there's one about a jungle and...  shutting him up, covering the intercom Steve! Never talk concepts with the intercom. to intercom Can we come inside and wait for him?  V.O. No.  Can we leave him a message?  V.O. No.  to Doug Let's just forget it.  Stay strong, sailor. to intercom Do you know where we can find him?  V.O. He's at the office in Wilshire. They jump in the car and drive off.  V.O. singing 'Footloose' ... 'Everybody cut, everybody cut... doo doo.'      We see a large engraved marble Zadir Industries sign above the entrance.      We see each elevator button is the name of Zadir's many businesses Zadir Dry Cleaners, Zadir Beepers, Zadir Gaming  Entertainment, Zadir Real Estate, Executive Suite.  listen to a  of  by Haddaway. Their heads begin to bop very slowly. A hotlooking businesswoman gets on. They guys smile politely and wait patiently. We hear a . The businesswoman gets off.  Hey, Steve, did you notice we forgot to ask her something?  You mean, 'What's up?'  Yeah. That's weird.  Actually, it's not. We're both involved in serious relationships now, and our ladies know they can trust us. 'Trust' being the key element in any worthwhile commitment.  Why go out for burgers when we've got steak at home?  You're right. We should get lunch after this.       Elevator doors open. Doug and Steve exit onto a very modern white glass floor.  Doug and Steve walk over to a .  Doug and Steve Butabi for Mr. Zadir.  You're brothers? Doug and Steve give each other a look. They're tempted to tell their brother joke.  Ma'am, thanks for the setup, but we really can't get into that right now. Steve looks down the hall of offices to his left. 'S  At the end of the hall, Mr. Zadir and Dooey quickly walk by.  Doug, Mr. Zadir! The guys run down the hall.  Hey, you can't...!  The guys run past office files, they pass a Fed Ex woman. Steve stops in his tracks.  Look, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm in a serious relationship right now. Steve immediately jumps back into full stride.  The guys turn a corner.  As Dooey closes the door, we see Mr. Zadir at the head of a board meeting. Zadir does not see them. Dooey turns around.  Dooey! My very main man. Up top! The guys raise their hands to high five.      Dooey forcefully drags the guys by their shirts, through the door and towards the elevators.  sincere So, Dooey, how's everything goin'?  Ragin' party last night.  Yeah, is that what my mother said to you... indicating he heard them in the limo ... or was it my father? Dooey drops the guys next to the elevator, presses the down button, begins to walk away.  So, Zadir wants to have this meeting by the elevators? Dooey stops and slowly turns around.  Those Redi Whip cans were a big hit last night. I was out till four in the morning trying to find more.  impressed From dusk 'til dawn  you, sir, are a party animal.  threatening Don't go near Mr. Zadir. He was drunk last night and he doesn't even remember you. You think you're the first losers he's picked up that I've had to get rid of come Monday?  Uh... Dooman, I don't know if I'm reading my dissmeter correctly. Because are we being blown off.  Just stay away if you know what's good for you. Dooey walks away. The guys are in shock for a beat. Suddenly, Doug bolts full speed past Dooey and back into the office. Dooey follows.    Doug runs up to the shut door and starts banging. No response. He notices, to the left, a glass window looking into the conference room. 'S  Zadir looks up  we can't tell if he sees Doug or not.  Suddenly, two burly security guys pull Doug away.   'S    The security guys physically push the guys out the building.  to security Alright, so we'll see you guys later. The security guys, unfazed, walk back in.      The guys get in and sit there, depressed. After a beat...  What do you want to do?  I can't talk to you right now. Give me a second.  Maybe we should just go back to work.  Yeah, and maybe we should just go to college and not put gel in our hair and starts wearing blue jeans. Let's do that, Steve!  ... Sorry. Steve suddenly gets an idea and reaches into the glove compartment. He pulls out the piece of paper with Cambi's number on it  we see he's put it in a small lucite frame.  trying to cheer Doug up Cambi's number. Doug looks up at the number, starts to come out of his funk.  We had a sweet time last night, didn't we?  Sweet ass time.  Diabetic. I could see doing that again, maybe even a couple a times a week, right?  The ladies await, my friend. Cell! Steve slaps a cellular phone into Doug's hand. Steve looks down, shifts again, they pull out.      Cambi and Vivica are standing by the bar, talking to  and , two middleaged Japanese businessmen .  Yeah, I think it's great how you get to travel around the world.  in Japanese These hotties are sweet.  in Japanese Sweet ass. We hear a  in Cambi's bag. She checks the beeper.  Who is it?  I don't know. It's just a bunch of pound signs.      Doug is repeatedly pressing the phone pad over and over.  I'm not sure you're doing it right.  frustrated Steve, you have to hit the pound sign or it doesn't go through. sighs Maybe their phones aren't working.  Try putting in our number and then hitting pound.  Excuse me, Mr. Bill Nye the Science Guy. Doug starts putting in their number...      Cambi is talking on a cellular phone near the table, as Vivica entertains the Japanese businessmen.  Hello?  Cambi. It's your boyfriend. I need to see you.  not knowing who it is Uh... well, I'm at the Skybar.  Be right there... sweetheart. Steve gives Doug a thumbs up.      The van pulls up and the guys get out and head in.  How's my hair?  Good.  Longterm relationship good?  It's totally committed. You know, Doug, when things aren't going so well, it really makes you realize how much your woman means to you.      Steve and Doug enter and are hit with the unwelcome sight of their girls flirting with the businessmen. They strut over, ready to fight.  These guys bothering you?  Hi, Doug.  to businessmen You guys messing with our women.  in Japanese What's up?  You want to mix it up? Come on! Take me on. I'm insane. You don't know what you're dealing with. The businessmen look at them strangely.  Vivica, I'm feeling a little vulnerable here. I thought we had an understanding. And I can't believe you're willing to just throw away everything we've been to each other?  Doug, Steve, this is Akiro and Toronaga... they're my cousins. Steve is relieved, Doug is mistrustful.  holding out hand to shake Oh! Well, it's about time that we met the family.  pulling to Steve's hand back Come on! What do you think, we're stupid? How can they be your cousins?  like talking to a child Well, his mother and my mother are sisters and that makes us cousins.  ... Oh. Okay.  to Akiro and Toronaga Would you excuse us a second?  Yeah, we just got to talk to them a second.  Yeah, 'cause we slept with them last night so...         Cambi and Vivica, Steve, Doug assemble near the Silk van.  So, did you guys have as good a time last night as we did?  I had a great time, Vivica. In fact, I think we've reached the point where I can comfortably call you 'Viv' and leave out the 'Ica.'  So, you guys want to hang out or see a movie or do what we did last night... or eat or... just do what we did last night or hang out, eat and then do what we did last night or... you know, whatever... and do what we did last night.  Sounds good. Cambi gives Doug a kiss. He melts, then quickly tries to act cool. Vivica affectionately holds Steve's arm.  Viv, I'm glad our relationship is strong enough to withstand the hard times  like when were just in the bar  I also think we're not just projecting onto one another but dealing with the reality of who we are. And most important, we know how to listen.  What?  Hey, you boys want to go somewhere quiet? The girls look at them seductively.  No...  Yes!  in reference to joke It's gold. I'm telling you. The guys high five and laugh  they walk to the van. Doug opens the passenger door.  Ladies, have your boarding passes ready. Cambi and Vivica just stand there.  What are you doing?  Aisle or window seat? I'm sorry, ma'am, you're gonna have to check that bag... The movie on this flight will be uh... I don't know. I can't think of any more.  Where's your car?  Our dad got mad and took it away.  Your dad?  Yeah, we used to work for him, but we quit today so actually we're unemployed.  You're not in business with Mr. Zadir?  Yes, we are. But, not now. We just met him last night. But, we will be. So, no, but, yes.  Especially, if we ever get to see him again. The girls digest this for a beat. Cambi signals to Vivica and they both start walking back to the bar. The guys, confused, run up to them.  Hey, we were just kidding about those boarding passes. You can get in.  Get away from us.  What's going on?  You guys are a big waste of time.  ... Como what?  Steve, you're a jerkoff.  Well, I'm glad you shared that with me. That's a big step for the both of us.  Guys, consider what we did with you last night a favor. Now do us a favor and never talk to us again!  What did we do wrong? We'll change.  No, you can't change. You and your brother are ugly pathetic losers. to Cambi That's the problem with nightclubs. Poor schmucks look just the same as rich schmucks. The girls walk back to the bar. The guys watch them go.  as they walk I can't believe we actually had sex with those asswads. I hope the nips are still at the bar. The girls disappear into the bar. The guys stand in shock, trying to absorb the ultimate rejection.      Slowmoving congestion. We see the Silk van driving in the middle of it.      Doug and Steve sit in silence for a while.  trying to cheer him up Hey, Doug, I think some of the plants are beginning to wilt... no, I'm just kidding. They're made out of silk. Doug doesn't respond.  singing quietly ... 'This is it.'  cutting him off Steve! This is the worst day of my life. So, if you don't mind, I really don't want to hear you talk right now.

Maybe events wouldn't go awry if I had someone with a brain sitting next to me.  Oh, yeah. Well, maybe I'd have better events if I was with someone with a higher level of looks and taller. Doug, in shock, starts to hyperventilate from anger.  breathing heavily I'm tall enough to kick your ass.  cupping his ear Did you say something? It's hard to hear things that low down to the ground.  Well hear this. Consider me your exbrother.  I don't care.  You care about this? Doug fakes throwing a punch  Steve flinches.

Look, the catering is paid for. The tents are all set up. Your grandparents flew half way around the world. Besides, all men go through the same thing the night before their wedding.

Now I understand the bride and groom have each prepared something.  trying to rhyme Dear Steve, today I wear this wedding gown, and on my face there is no frown. I know our lives together will be great, just like when we saw David Copperfield on our first date. If you set something free and it comes back, you should love it forever, and like one of your silk plants, I'll try to stay beautiful, that is my endeavor. Love, forever, Emily. Steve steps forward, takes out a piece of paper, reads.  Emily, I used to see you outside my father's store. And then we went out on some dates and you let me have sex with you. Steve steps back. Priest looks to see if Steve's done.  I'm done.  Very nice. Steven, do you promise to love Emily, comfort her, honor her, in sickness and in health, as long as you both shall live?

I'm sorry, Mr. Butabi, but as best man, my primary duty is to allow the groom to beat a hasty retreat should the occasion take a sudden ugly turn. Butabi tries to get around. Craig jumps in the way.  Don't test me. Steve runs up to Doug.  Hey.  Hello. They run out of the back yard.  Puts his arm around Mr. Butabi.  Mr. Butabi, as an actor, I'm a keen observer of human nature. And, I can tell that neither of your sons are anywhere near the maturity level necessary for this sort of commitment.  Emily is furious. Craig steps in the groom's spot.  Go ahead, Father.  What are you doing?  Emily, with all due respect to Steve, his discipline is lacking as is his appreciation for you. I, on the other hand, can bench press 305 lbs.

And it seems to me that you're a little bit harder on Doug than you are on Steve. Isn't that true? .  You are right. It's just that Doug is so rebellious, so hard to control.  Rebellious? Scrappy? Dreamer, maybe? What other young man does that remind you of? Mr. Butabi has an epiphany. .  ... Myself. Richard nods, knowingly.  So who are you really fighting with? .
