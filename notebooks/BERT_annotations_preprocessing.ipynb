    "Helpful resources for how film classifications are determined can be found here: \n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.classification.gov.au/classification-ratings/how-rating-decided\n",
    "\n",
    "Some relevant excerpts below: \n",
    "\n",
    "Approved classification tools use logic rules and algorithms to classify content.\n",
    "\n",
    "The guidelines include 6 classifiable elements. These are:\n",
    "\n",
    "themes\n",
    "violence\n",
    "sex\n",
    "language\n",
    "drug use\n",
    "nudity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Impact\n",
    "The impact depends on the frequency, intensity and the overall effect of the content. The purpose, tone and style can affect impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "Impact may increase where depictions are:\n",
    "\n",
    "detailed\n",
    "prolonged\n",
    "realistic\n",
    "interactive.\n",
    "Impact may be lower where content is:\n",
    "\n",
    "implied rather than depicted\n",
    "not detailed\n",
    "short in duration\n",
    "verbal and not visual\n",
    "incidental and not direct.\n",
    "The level of impact allowed in each classification category (rating):\n",
    "\n",
    "Rating\tImpact level\n",
    "G\tVery mild\n",
    "PG\tMild\n",
    "M\tModerate\n",
    "MA 15+\tStrong\n",
    "R 18+\tHigh\n",
    "RC\tVery high\n",
    "\n",
    "<i> So we have six relevant categories, and six impact levels corresponding to the 6 ratings.  The goal will be then to build a model that basically scores the impact level of the screenplay on these six measures, then uses those six scores to make the prediction/classsification.  So e.g., we might except a neural network architecture to look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "embedding layer(vector for each {sentence, word} in screenplay)\n",
    "- > 6 (?) neurons, one for each classifiable element\n",
    "( -> context layer? )\n",
    "- > 6 (?) neurons, an impact score for each element \n",
    "- > 1 output neuron for classification\n",
    "OR \n",
    "- > an output layer per country classification desired? </i> \n",
    "\n",
    "Context\n",
    "Context determines whether the storyline justifies content. Content that falls into a particular rating in one context may fall outside it in a different context.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the way the content deals with social issues may require a mature or adult perspective. Historical context may also justify certain depictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "<i> Should there be a separate context layer then? </i>\n",
    "\n",
    "Consumer advice\n",
    "Under section 20 of the Act, a classification decision must include consumer advice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consumer advice gives information about the content. It usually describes the classifiable elements with the greatest impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a film classified PG may have consumer advice of 'Mild violence and coarse language'. This means that the film is PG because the violence and coarse language are mild in impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "<i> Ideally, our model would also therefore output this Consumer Advice </i> \n",
