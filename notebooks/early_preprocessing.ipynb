       "'\\nLa Belle et la BÃªte (Beauty and the Beast) \\n\\nLa Belle et la BÃªte (Beauty and the Beast)\\nOPENING TITLE:\\n\\nChildren believe what we tell them. \\nThey have complete faith in us. \\nThey believe that a rose plucked \\nfrom a garden can bring drama to \\na family. They believe that the \\nhands of a human beast will smoke \\nwhen he kills a victim, and that \\nthis beast will be shamed when \\nconfronted by a young girl. They \\nbelieve in a thousand other simple \\nthings. I ask of you a little of \\nthis childlike simplicity, and to \\nbring us luck let me speak four \\ntruly magic words, childhood\\'s \\nOpen Sesame: \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\"Once upon a time...\" \\n\\n\\n\\nBeauty lives in the country with her father, a 17th-century merchant who has \\nlost all his money; her brother, Ludovic, whose only interests are drinking \\nand gambling; and her two sisters, Felicie and Adelaide, who are motivated \\nentirely by spite, selfishness and vanity. Her brother\\'s constant companion, \\nAvenant, is a frequent visitor to the house.\\n \\nLudovic and Avenant are shooting arrows at a target fixed onto the wall of \\nthe house.\\n\\nFelicie and Adelaide are inside. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE \\n\\t\\t\\t(angrily) \\n\\t\\tOh, that wretched girl! \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tADELAIDE \\n\\t\\tYou know she can\\'t do anything right. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC \\n\\t\\t\\t(taking aim and shooting)\\n\\t\\tA bad one. \\n\\nHe steps aside. Avenant aims. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC\\n\\t\\tYour foot.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAVENANT \\n\\t\\tWhat about my foot?\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC\\n\\t\\tYou\\'re cheating, it\\'s not on the mark.\\n \\nAvenant shoots. The arrow flies straight through the upper window of the \\nhouse and impales itself in the floor next to a silk cushion. A little dog \\nleaps up from the cushion, barking furiously. Beauty is attending to her \\nsisters who, in sharp, contrast to her simple attire, are dressed in rich \\nsilks and feathers. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE \\n\\t\\tWhat\\'s going on? \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tADELAIDE \\n\\t\\tThey\\'ve just shot an arrow into the room!\\n \\n \\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE\\n\\t\\tOh!\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tADELAIDE \\n\\t\\t\\t(going to the window and shouting)\\n\\t\\tYou hooligans! You could have hit one of us in \\n\\t\\tthe eye!\\n \\nLudovic and Avenant rush up to the house. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAVENANT\\n\\t\\tIs Beauty all right?\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tADELAIDE \\n\\t\\t\\t(shouting out of the window) \\n\\t\\tBeauty! Always Beauty! Who cares about Beauty? \\n\\t\\tYou nearly killed Cabriole! \\n\\nLudovic and Avenant go into the house and wait at the foot of the stairs.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC \\n\\t\\t\\t(ironically)\\n\\t\\tHere they come. \\n\\nFelicie and Adelaide hurry down.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE \\n\\t\\t\\t(shouting)\\n\\t\\tBeauty, you can wash the floor. We\\'ll be late \\n\\t\\tfor the duchess.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tADELAIDE \\n\\t\\t\\t(to the two men) \\n\\t\\tMurderers! \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC \\n\\t\\t\\t(to Avenant) \\n\\t\\tMy sisters are such bitches.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE \\n\\t\\t\\t(to Adelaide)\\n\\t\\tDrinking, chasing women and cheating at cards, \\n\\t\\tthat\\'s all they ever think about. They couldn\\'t \\n\\t\\tgive a damn about anything else.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC \\n\\t\\t\\t(to Avenant) \\n\\t\\tWhen one is poor, one stays at home to do the \\n\\t\\tlaundry and polish the pots and pans. Just look \\n\\t\\tat these two sluts -- they think they\\'re \\n\\t\\tprincesses. They don\\'t even realize that \\n\\t\\tthey\\'re the laughing stock of society.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tADELAIDE \\n\\t\\t\\t(to Felicie)\\n\\t\\tSay something! \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE \\n\\t\\tHe\\'d be only too pleased. \\n\\nThey flounce out of the house.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC\\n\\t\\tOh, such beauties! So ravishing!\\n \\n \\t\\t\\t\\tADELAIDE \\n\\t\\t\\t(to Felicie)\\n\\t\\tCome on, we\\'ll be late for the concert.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC\\n \\t\\t\\t(following them out of the house) \\n\\t\\tEnchantresses! Goddesses! Shining lights!\\n \\n \\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE \\n\\t\\t\\t(shouting)\\n\\t\\tHey there! Boys! Boys! \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC\\n \\t\\t\\t(imitating her)\\n\\t\\tBoys! Boys!\\n \\nFelicie and Adelaide walk across the yard toward a servant who is dozing in a \\nsedan chair. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tADELAIDE \\n\\t\\tOh!\\n \\nThe boy leaps out of the chair. Felicie sits down. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE \\n\\t\\t\\t(angrily)\\n\\t\\tThis is unbelievable!\\n \\nAdelaide walks over to another servant who is lolling against a pile of straw.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tADELAIDE \\n\\t\\tI suppose you think we pay you to sleep! \\n\\nShe walks over to a second sedan chair. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tADELAIDE \\n\\t\\t\\t(angrily) \\n\\t\\tI\\'ve never seen anything like it! \\n\\nShe opens the door to the chair. Three or four hens cackle and flap, their \\nwings as she shoos them out of the chair.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tADELAIDE \\n\\t\\tOh, the chairs. \\n\\t\\t\\t(She sits down.)\\n\\t\\tLook at them, they\\'re filthy! Boys! Boys!\\n\\nTwo more servant boys come running out of the stable. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tONE OF THE BOYS \\n\\t\\t\\t(yawning) \\n\\t\\tCome on, let\\'s go.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE\\n\\t\\tStop dawdling, wake up now... You\\'ve been \\n\\t\\tdrinking! \\n\\nThe four boys pick up the two sedan chairs and stumble their way across the \\nyard.  They pass in front of Ludovic, who is leaning against the wall, \\nwatching in amusement.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tADELAIDE \\n\\t\\t\\t(to Felice)\\n\\t\\tJust look at this drunkard.

Go on, you \\n\\t\\tlouse, get out of here!\\n \\nAvenant strikes him. Ludovic staggers and falls over. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\t\\t(running over to him) \\n\\t\\tAvenant! You\\'re crazy! Ludovic! Ludovic!\\n \\nDownstairs, the merchant enters the house, ushering three men in before him.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE MERCHANT\\n\\t\\tCome in, gentlemen, come in.

Come closer,\\n\\t\\tLudovic. You too, Avenant, you\\'re most welcome. \\n\\t\\tThese gentlemen are willing to forgive you for \\n\\t\\tall your pranks.

A lawyer\\'s office.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE LAWYER\\n\\t\\tBut my dear Sir, what can I do? \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE MERCHANT \\n\\t\\t\\t(in despair)\\n\\t\\tAs there\\'s nothing left from this last ship, \\n\\t\\twhat\\'s to become of me?\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE LAWYER\\n\\t\\tYour creditors at the port moved faster than \\n\\t\\tthe ones in town. Sue them.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE MERCHANT \\n\\t\\tSue them! I haven\\'t even got enough to pay for \\n\\t\\ta room tonight.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE LAWYER\\n\\t\\tWell, go home then.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE MERCHANT \\n\\t\\tBut I\\'ll have to go through the forest in the \\n\\t\\tmiddle of the night. I\\'ll get lost.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE LAWYER\\n\\t\\tYou came through it at night on your way here, \\n\\t\\tdidn\\'t you? \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE MERCHANT\\n\\t\\tYes, but there was a full moon then, and it\\'s \\n\\t\\tgetting foggy now. I know I\\'ll get lost.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE LAWYER \\n\\t\\t\\t(losing his patience)\\n\\t\\tWell then, get lost. \\n\\nThe lawyer shows him out.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE MERCHANT\\n\\t\\tI don\\'t understand you; I\\'m sure you\\'d feel the \\n\\t\\tsame if you were in my shoes. It\\'s very \\n\\t\\tfrightening.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE LAWYER\\n\\t\\tGood night!\\n\\nThe merchant fetches his horse, mounts and starts off.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE LAWYER\\n\\t\\tGood luck!\\n\\nThe merchant rides deeper into the forest. It grows dark and a storm breaks. \\nAfter a while he realizes that he has lost his way. He dismounts and leads \\nhis horse along the narrow forest paths, peering anxiously through the \\nthickening mist. During a flash of lightning through the leaves he suddenly \\nsees a magnificent castle. With a puzzled look on his face he walks slowly \\nthrough the trees across a courtyard toward the castle gates. As he makes his \\nway, the branches silently close in behind him. When he reaches the gates, \\nthey open before him. Surprised, he lets go of the horse\\'s reins. The horse \\nwalks in ahead of him. The merchant follows, but the gates close in front of \\nhim. He runs back across the courtyard and looks up at the castle.\\n \\n\\n\\nThe castle.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE MERCHANT\\n\\t\\tIs there anyone there?\\n \\nIn front of him is a wide stone staircase leading to a door in the castle \\nwall.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE MERCHANT \\n\\t\\t\\t(running up the stairs)\\n\\t\\tIs there anyone there?\\n \\nHe goes through the door and is confronted by a row of human arms holding \\ncandelabras, showing him the way down a corridor to a large hall. He stops \\nand stares in disbelief. Two of the human arms release the candelabras, which \\nremain magically suspended, pointing toward the hall. Awed, the merchant \\nbacks into the room toward a huge fireplace. A clock on the mantlepiece \\nstrikes eleven. He turns around and looks from the fire to a dining table, \\nwhich is sumptuously set with food and drink.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE MERCHANT\\n\\t\\tIs there anyone there?\\n \\nHe puts his hat on the table, sits down and removes his gloves. A marble \\nbust, which supports one end of the vast mantlepiece, slowly turns its head \\ntoward him. At the other side of the fireplace, its counterpart, breathing \\nsmoke through its nostrils, also moves its head around to look at him.\\n \\nThe merchant reaches for a silver goblet. A hand appears from the candelabra \\nin the middle of the table. The merchant starts back. The hand takes hold of \\na wine decanter, fills the goblet, and returns to the candelabra. The \\nmerchant lifts up the edge of the tablecloth and peers underneath it. He \\nstares at the candelabra on the table, stands up and turns to look once more \\nat the row of candelabras leading out of the room.\\n \\nHe sits down again, picks up the goblet, sniffs at it suspiciously, and \\ndrinks. He falls into a deep sleep. The marble busts turn their heads again.\\n \\nThe merchant slowly wakes up. His hand is resting on the wooden arm of his \\nchair, which is carved in the image of a lion\\'s head. The lion\\'s head comes \\nto life under his hand and roars.\\n\\nThe merchant leaps to his feet and grabs his gloves. The marble bust breathes \\nsmoke. The candelabra on the dining table extinguishes itself.\\n \\nThe merchant takes a last look around the room, walks hurriedly down the \\ncorridor past the row of candelabras and leaves the castle. The door shuts \\nsilently behind him. He walks slowly down the stairs and along a balustrade \\ndecorated with stone statues of fierce-looking dogs. He stop and looks around \\nhim.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE MERCHANT\\n\\t\\tHey there! \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tECHO\\n\\t\\t\\'Hey there!\\' \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE MERCHANT \\n\\t\\t\\t(walking along the balustrade) \\n\\t\\tHey there! \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tECHO\\n\\t\\t\\'Hey there!\\' \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE MERCHANT \\n\\t\\t\\t(coming to the end of the balustrade)\\n\\t\\tHey there! \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tECHO\\n\\t\\t\\'Hey there!\\' \\n\\nHe goes down some steps and finds himself in a beautiful rose garden. He \\nlooks around nervously and walks over toward the flowers. Suddenly he \\nstumbles over the body of a dead deer. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE MERCHANT \\n\\t\\t\\t(starting back with a look of horror) \\n\\t\\tHey there! \\n\\nHe looks down and sees a perfect rose, which changes color as he watches. \\nJust as the merchant plucks the rose, the Beast appears through a curtain of \\nleaves. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST\\n\\t\\tHey there!\\n \\nThe Beast walks over to the merchant. He has the appearance of a werewolf, \\nwith long fangs and grotesque features. His huge gnarled hands end in claws \\nand, like the rest of him, are covered in thick matted fur. He is wearing a \\nlong jeweled cloak over a doublet with slashed sleeves and a broad lace \\ncollar, a pair of velvet breeches and high leather boots.\\n\\nAs he speaks, the wind blows and the leaves and branches rustle.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST\\n\\t\\tSo, my dear Sir, you steal my roses. My roses \\n\\t\\twhich are the most precious things in the whole \\n\\t\\tworld to me. You are most unfortunate since you \\n\\t\\tcould have taken anything but my roses. The \\n\\t\\tpenalty for such a simple theft is death.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE MERCHANT\\n\\t\\t\\t(flinging himself to his knees)\\n\\t\\tMy Lord, I did not know. I did not think I \\n\\t\\twould offend anyone by plucking a rose for my \\n\\t\\tdaughter. She asked for one.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST \\n\\t\\tOne does not call me \"my Lord\"; one calls me \\n\\t\\t\"Beast.\" I don\\'t like compliments. No, don\\'t \\n\\t\\ttry to understand. You have fifteen minutes in \\n\\t\\twhich to prepare yourself for your death. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE MERCHANT\\n\\t\\tMy Lord!\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST \\n\\t\\t\\t(angrily)\\n\\t\\tAgain! The Beast orders you to be silent. You\\n\\t\\tstole my rose and you shall die. Unless ...  \\n\\t\\tunless one of your daughters .... How many do \\n\\t\\tyou have? \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE MERCHANT\\n\\t\\tThree.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST \\n\\t\\tUnless one of your daughters agrees to pay the \\n\\t\\tpenalty and take your place. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE MERCHANT\\n\\t\\tBut...\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST \\n\\t\\t\\t(angrily)\\n\\t\\tDon\\'t argue! Go! Take advantage of the one \\n\\t\\tchance I have given you. And if your daughters \\n\\t\\trefuse to die instead of you, swear that you\\'ll \\n\\t\\treturn in three day\\'s time. Swear!\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE MERCHANT\\n\\t\\tI swear. But I don\\'t know my way through the \\n\\t\\tforest ...\\n \\n \\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST \\n\\t\\tYou\\'ll find a white horse in my stables. His \\n\\t\\tname is \\'Magnificent One.\\' Just whisper in his \\n\\t\\tear, \"Go where I am going, Magnificent One, go, \\n\\t\\tgo.\" He\\'ll take you home and lead you back to \\n\\t\\tthe castle if your daughters are too cowardly \\n\\t\\tto mount him. Now leave.\\n\\nThe Beast backs away into the curtain of leaves and disappears. The merchant \\nruns off toward the stables. A beautiful white stallion awaits him there. He \\nmounts him and sets off.\\n\\nAs the white; horse carries the merchant through the forest, the Beast \\nwatches him through the leaves. The branches close in silently behind the \\nmerchant as he makes his way home.\\n \\n\\n\\nLater.\\n\\nThe merchant is at home, surrounded by his family.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE MERCHANT\\n\\t\\tI can\\'t tell you anything about my journey \\n\\t\\thome. The Magnificent One is in the stable. \\n\\t\\tThat\\'s the end of my story. Beauty, take this \\n\\t\\trose, I\\'m paying a high price for it. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE \\n\\t\\tThat\\'s what happens when an idiotic girl asks \\n\\t\\tfor roses. This is the result of that silly \\n\\t\\tcreature\\'s vanity.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tADELAIDE\\n\\t\\tAnd she pretends to be modest, and set us an \\n\\t\\texample. She\\'s not even crying.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\tYou won\\'t die, father. It\\'s my fault; it\\'s only \\n\\t\\tright that I go in your place.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAVENANT\\n\\t\\tAre you mad? We\\'ll go with Ludovic and we\\'ll \\n\\t\\tkill this horrible beast.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE MERCHANT\\n\\t\\tThe Beast is so powerful that we have no hope \\n\\t\\tof overcoming him. Don\\'t worry Beauty, I\\'m \\n\\t\\tgrowing old. I promised, so I shall go.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE \\n\\t\\tYou mustn\\'t go, father, you may yet win your \\n\\t\\tcase. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tADELAIDE \\n\\t\\tHow will we live?\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE MERCHANT\\n\\t\\tYou can sell the furniture.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC\\n\\t\\tWhy don\\'t you go, Felicie? You\\'re too tough for \\n\\t\\tanyone to eat!\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE\\n\\t\\tIt\\'s a great pity that the Beast isn\\'t \\n\\t\\tdemanding boys.

Making sure that no one sees her, she goes to the stable and mounts \\nthe white horse.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\tGo where I\\'m going, Magnificent One, go, go!\\n \\nThe horse trots out of the stable. The farm gates open before him. He carries \\nBeauty through the forest to the castle. She dismounts and leads him through \\nthe foliage, which closes in behind her.\\n \\nAs though in a dream she enters the castle and floats past the rows of \\ncandelabras, through the large hall with the fireplace, and up a flight of \\nstairs. She goes through a door which leads to a long gallery with billowing \\nwhite curtains. Seemingly carried along by some magical force, she comes to a \\ndoor flanked on each side by human arms carrying candelabras. The arms move \\ntoward the door, casting their light onto her.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tVOICE \\n\\t\\t\\t(whispering as the door opens)\\n\\t\\tBeauty, I am the door to your room.\\n \\n \\nBeauty enters the room hesitantly. The door closes silently behind her. She \\nlooks round the room which is spacious, elegantly furnished, and full of \\nflowers and plants. A marble bust on one of the walls moves its head around \\ntoward her.\\n \\nBeauty rushes over to the open window as though seeking her freedom.  \\nRealizing the futility of her action, she sits down at a dressing table and, \\nin despair, puts her head in her hands.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tVOICE FROM THE \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDRESSING TABLE MIRROR \\n\\t\\t\\t(whisperingly) \\n\\t\\tBeauty, I am your mirror; reflect in me; I will \\n\\t\\treflect for you.\\n \\nBeauty puts her hands out toward the mirror and gazes into it. The glass is \\nblack.  Then she sees her father lying on his sickbed. The mirror turns black \\nagain. She stands up and looks round the room. On the large bed, a luxurious \\nfur cover is pulled back by invisible hands. Beauty runs out of the room, \\nalong the corridor, out of the castle, down the stone staircase into the \\ncourtyard.\\n \\nAcross the courtyard the doors open and the Beast makes his appearance. \\nBeauty lets out a cry of fear and horror. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST \\n\\t\\tWhere are you going?\\n \\nShe falls to the ground in a faint. The Beast walks over to her, gathers her \\ngently in his arms and carries her carefully up the stone staircase with a \\nlook of anguish mingled with tenderness.\\n \\nHe takes her back into the castle, past the row of candelabras, up the stairs \\ninto her room. As he crosses the threshold of the room, Beauty\\'s clothes are \\ntransformed. She is dressed like a princess in a richly embroidered silk \\ndress with sparkling jewels. The Beast puts her down gently onto the bed and \\nstares at her intently. She awakens, opens her eyes, and turns her head \\ntoward the Beast. As she sees him she lets out a cry. He backs away across \\nthe room.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST \\n\\t\\tBeauty, you mustn\\'t look me in the eyes. Do not \\n\\t\\tfear, you will never see me, except every \\n\\t\\tevening at seven, when you dine. I shall come \\n\\t\\tto the great hall. \\n\\t\\t\\t(He backs out of the room.) \\n\\t\\tYou mustn\\'t look me in the eyes.\\n \\nThe door closes silently behind him.\\n \\n\\n\\nIn the great hall the clock strikes seven. On each side of the blazing fire \\nthe marble busts turn their heads. Beauty is sitting at the table, wearing a \\ndark jeweled dress, with matching jewels round her neck and wound into her \\nhair. The hand from the candelabra on the table picks up the silver wine \\ndecanter to serve her. She leans back in her chair with a sigh of despair and \\ncloses her eyes. The door opens behind her and the Beast crosses the room. He \\nstands behind her, leaning on the back of the chair.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST \\n\\t\\tDon\\'t be afraid.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\t\\t(summoning up all her courage)\\n\\t\\tI ... I won\\'t be afraid. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST \\n\\t\\tBeauty, do you mind if I watch you while you \\n\\t\\tdine?\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY\\n\\t\\tYou are the master.\\n \\n \\t\\t\\t\\tBEAST \\n\\t\\tNo, I\\'m not. \\n\\t\\t\\t(He pauses for a moment.) \\n\\t\\tThere is no master here but you. \\n\\t\\t\\t(He moves around to \\n\\t\\t\\tthe side of the chair.) \\n\\t\\tI revolt you; you must find me very ugly.\\n \\n \\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY\\n\\t\\tI cannot lie, Beast.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST \\n\\t\\tIs everything here to your liking?\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\tI feel uneasy dressed in such finery, nor am I \\n\\t\\tused to being waited upon. But I know you\\'re \\n\\t\\tdoing your utmost to help me forget your \\n\\t\\tugliness.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST \\n\\t\\t\\t(walking over to the fireplace)\\n\\t\\tMy heart is kind, but I am a monster.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY\\n\\t\\tMany men are more monstrous than you, but they \\n\\t\\thide it well.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST \\n\\t\\tBesides my ugliness, I am lacking in wit. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY\\n\\t\\tYou have wit enough to realize it.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST \\n\\t\\tEverything in this castle is yours. Your every \\n\\t\\twhim will be fulfilled.\\n  \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST \\n\\t\\t\\t(walking back to the dining table)\\n\\t\\tI shall appear every evening at seven. Before \\n\\t\\tleaving I shall ask you a question; it will \\n\\t\\talways be the same one.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY\\n\\t\\tWhat is your question?\\n \\n \\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST \\n\\t\\tBeauty, will you be my wife? \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\tNo, Beast.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST \\n\\t\\tFarewell then, Beauty. Until tomorrow. \\n\\nHe leaves the room.\\n \\n\\n\\nLater.\\n \\nBeauty walks fearfully across the hall. She is wearing a long white silk \\ngown. She hears a sound like the roar of wild beasts followed by the screams \\nof an animal in pain. She walks along the gallery, keeping close to the wall \\nas though looking for protection. The white curtains billow in the breeze. \\nShe stops by a marble bust, aware of some presence. The Beast appears and \\nwalks past with a look of hideous despair. He doesn\\'t see her hidden behind \\nthe statue. He stares at his huge grotesque hands, the sharp claws, and \\nburies his head in his arms. Beauty watches him in horror. He turns, goes to \\nthe door of her room, leans against it for a moment with the same look of \\nanguish. He enters the room, searching desperately for her. He sits down at \\nthe dressing table, picks up the mirror and stares into it.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST \\n\\t\\tWhere is Beauty? \\n\\t\\t\\t(shouting) \\n\\t\\tWhere is Beauty? \\n\\nSmoke billows out of the mirror. He gazes into it and sees her edging her way \\nslowly along the gallery to the door, listening carefully for any sound from \\nwithin. The Beast puts down the mirror, stands up and looks at the door.\\n \\nBeauty enters the room.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\t\\t(angrily)\\n\\t\\tWhat are you doing in my room?\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST \\n\\t\\t\\t(meekly)\\n\\t\\tI wanted to ... I was ... I came to your room \\n\\t\\tto bring you a gift.\\n\\nHe holds out his hand. A pearl necklace magically appears in the palm of his \\nhand.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\t\\t(shouting)\\n\\t\\tLeave!\\n \\nShe runs out of the room. Disconsolately, the Beast puts the necklace down on \\nthe dressing table.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\t\\t(in a softer voice)\\n\\t\\tLeave.\\n \\nThe Beast walks slowly out of the room. \\n\\nBeauty walks across the room to the dressing table and picks up the pearl \\nnecklace. She looks at it pensively.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nLater.\\n \\nBeauty is walking through the castle grounds. She comes to a door. She pushes \\nit open and looks through onto a pool of water surrounded by plants and \\ntrees. The Beast is on his knees by the edge of the pool, lapping up the \\nwater like an animal. Beauty closes the door and backs away with a concerned \\nlook on her face. She continues her walk through the grounds. She is wearing \\nthe pearl necklace that the Beast left in her room. The Beast appears among \\nthe stone statues of dogs.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST \\n\\t\\tI thought you were dining, Beauty.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY\\n\\t\\tI\\'m not hungry, Beast. I\\'d prefer to walk with \\n\\t\\tyou.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST \\n\\t\\t\\t(in a gentle voice) \\n\\t\\tBeauty, you\\'re doing me a great honor ... \\n\\t\\t\\nThey walk side by side along the stone balustrade. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST \\n\\t\\t... a very great honor. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY\\n\\t\\tYour voice seems gentler. \\n\\nThey stop.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST\\n\\t\\tBeauty, I hope you don\\'t find the days too \\n\\t\\ttedious. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\t\\t(walking on) \\n\\t\\tI do find the days long. And this evening I \\n\\t\\tadmit I was almost looking forward to seven \\n\\t\\to\\'clock.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST \\n\\t\\tYou are so kind that I can hardly bring myself \\n\\t\\tto ask you the question which torments me so.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY\\n\\t\\tAsk, I shall always give the same reply. Let\\'s \\n\\t\\tbe friends, Beast, don\\'t ask any more of me. \\n\\nThey walk on through the grounds.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY\\n\\t\\tTell me, Beast, how do you pass the day? \\n\\nA deer leaps through the bushes. The Beast stares at it greedily as it runs \\naway into the woods.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY\\n\\t\\tDid you hear me, Beast? I\\'m talking to you.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST \\n\\t\\t\\t(in a troubled voice) \\n\\t\\tFor ... forgive me. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\t\\t(putting her hand on the Beast\\'s arm)\\n\\t\\tBeast! What is it? \\n\\nThe Beast puts his head in his hands and turns away in shame. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST \\n\\t\\tForgive me, please forgive me, it\\'s nothing. \\n\\nBeauty hesitantly puts out her hand. He takes it, and leads her down the \\nstone staircase. They come to a fountain. The Beast puts his head in his hand \\nagain.\\n \\n \\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\tWhat\\'s the matter, Beast?\\n \\n \\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST \\n\\t\\tI\\'m thirsty, Beauty.\\n \\nBeauty goes to the fountain and fills her hands with water. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\t\\t(holding out her hands)\\n\\t\\tDrink from my hands. \\n\\nThe Beast laps the water from her hands and stares at her intently. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST \\n\\t\\tDoesn\\'t it revolt you to give me drink?\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY\\n\\t\\t\\t(looking him straight in the eyes)\\n\\t\\tNo, Beast, it gives me pleasure. I would never \\n\\t\\twish to cause you any pain. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST \\n\\t\\tAnd yet your dream is to be far away from me.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBeauty is in the great hall, walking up and down in front of the fire. She is \\nwearing a dark velvet dress. The marble busts at each end of the mantlepiece \\nturn their heads to watch her. The clock strikes half past seven. Beauty \\nlooks up at the clock and sees the Beast\\'s reflection in the mirror above it. \\nShe turns round as he walks across the room.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\tHow late you are!\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST \\n\\t\\tThank you, Beauty, for noticing.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\tYes, I was awaiting you with great impatience, \\n\\t\\tBeast. \\n\\nShe throws herself to her knees and grabs his cloak.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\tI must talk to you!\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST \\n\\t\\t\\t(shocked)\\n \\t\\tBeauty! Beauty!\\n \\n \\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\t\\t(still on her knees, pleading) \\n\\t\\tI cannot live another day without seeing my \\n\\t\\tfather again. Please let me go, I beg you!\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST \\n\\t\\tStand up, Beauty, stand up.\\n\\nHe pulls her to her feet and leads her to a chair. He sits down beside her.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST \\n\\t\\tI should be on my knees taking orders from you. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\t\\t(almost in tears) \\n\\t\\tLet me go. I promise to return. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST\\n\\t\\tAnd when you return, will you be my wife? \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\t\\t(in despair)\\n\\t\\tYou\\'re torturing me.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST \\n\\t\\tI know I\\'m repulsive. But I would die of \\n\\t\\theartbreak if I let you go and you took \\n\\t\\tadvantage of your freedom never to return.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\tI\\'d come back in a week\\'s time. I respect you \\n\\t\\ttoo much to cause your death.\\n\\nThe Beast lowers his head. Beauty strokes it.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST \\n\\t\\t\\t(looking up at her)\\n\\t\\tYou coax me as though I were an animal.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\t\\t(gently) \\n\\t\\tBut you are an animal.\\n \\n \\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST \\n\\t\\tYour request is a very serious matter. I must \\n\\t\\tthink about it. \\n\\t\\t\\t(He stands up.)\\n\\t\\tBeauty, will you come into the garden with me?\\n \\nHe takes her hand and leads her out of the castle.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST \\n\\t\\tBeauty, has someone already asked for your hand \\n\\t\\tin marriage? \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY\\n\\t\\tYes, Beast.\\n \\n \\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST \\n\\t\\tAh! ... And ... who asked for your hand?  A \\n\\t\\tyoung man?\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\tYes, Beast.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST\\n\\t\\tIs he handsome? \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\tYes, Beast.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST\\n\\t\\tWhy did you not marry him? \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\tI didn\\'t want to leave my father.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST \\n\\t\\tAnd what is this handsome young man\\'s name, \\n\\t\\tBeauty? \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\tAvenant.\\n \\nThe Beast looks at her, turns away as though in pain and suddenly runs away \\nthrough the trees.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\t\\t(shouting)\\n\\t\\tBeast! What\\'s the matter? ... Beast! Beast! \\n\\t\\tWhat is it? ... Beast!\\n \\n \\n\\n\\nLater.\\n  \\nBeauty is lying in bed. Suddenly she hears a noise outside the door. She runs \\nto the door which opens before her. The Beast is standing in the shadows.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\tWhat are you doing at my door at such a late \\n\\t\\thour? \\n\\nThe Beast moves into the light.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\tMy God! You\\'re covered in blood! \\n\\nShe starts back in horror. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST \\n\\t\\tForgive me ... \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\tFor what?\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST \\n\\t\\t\\t(almost groveling) \\n\\t\\tFor being a beast, forgive me. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\t\\t(firmly) \\n\\t\\tIt doesn\\'t become you to talk in that way. \\n\\t\\tAren\\'t you ashamed of yourself? Go and clean \\n\\t\\tyourself and go to sleep.\\n\\nShe stands there looking at him in all her innocence and purity. The Beast is \\novercome with shame and self-disgust.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST\\n\\t\\t\\t(in despair)\\n\\t\\tClose the door! Close the door! \\n\\t\\t\\t(She doesn\\'t move.) \\n\\t\\tQuick ... quick, close the door. Your look is \\n\\t\\tburning me, I can\\'t bear it.\\n\\nHe backs away. The door closes gently behind him. Beauty walks slowly toward \\nthe bed with a troubled look on her face.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nLater.\\n \\nAt the merchant\\'s house.\\n \\nThe bailiffs are removing the furniture on instructions from the usurer. \\nAvenant and Ludovic are sitting at the table, watching. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAVENANT\\n\\t\\tThey\\'re taking every single thing. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC\\n\\t\\tI don\\'t suppose they\\'ll even leave the table. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAVENANT\\n\\t\\tLet\\'s play cards.\\n \\nHe picks up a pack of cards. The usurer walks over to them with a \\ndisapproving look.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE USURER \\n\\t\\t\\t(to Ludovic)\\n\\t\\tGo up to your father. He doesn\\'t understand \\n\\t\\twhat\\'s going on, which is only natural. I can\\'t \\n\\t\\tvery well explain the situation to him. \\n\\nLudovic looks doubtfully at Avenant. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAVENANT \\n\\t\\t\\t(resigned) \\n\\t\\tGo on.\\n \\n \\n\\nLater.\\n \\nUpstairs the merchant is lying ill in bed. Ludovic stands beside him, looking \\nsorry for himself.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE MERCHANT \\n\\t\\t\\t(in a weak voice)\\n\\t\\tLudovic ... Ludovic ... is it true? \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC\\n\\t\\tI\\'m afraid it is.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE MERCHANT\\n\\t\\tLudovic, how could you have done such a thing? \\n\\nThe usurer hurries into the room.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAVENANT\\n\\t\\t\\t(following him)\\n\\t\\tSir, he\\'s a very sick man, you must leave the \\n\\t\\tbed.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE USURER\\n\\t\\tYes, yes, we won\\'t take the beds.\\n\\nThey go downstairs into the hall. Adelaide and Felicie run down the stairs \\nand hurry out of the house.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC\\n\\t\\tI bet they\\'ve seen to it that no one touches \\n\\t\\ttheir things! \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE USURER\\n\\t\\tNo, no, they too owe me money.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BAILIFFS \\n\\t\\t\\t(coming through the door \\n\\t\\t\\twith more furniture)\\n\\t\\tCome on, it\\'s all got to go!\\n \\nThe usurer leaves the house. Avenant and Ludovic sit down at the table in the \\notherwise bare room. Ludovic brings out a purse and pours money on to the \\ntable with a smile. Avenant picks up the pack of cards and deals. Ludovic \\nlooks at his hand.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC \\n\\t\\t\\t(piling up his stake)\\n\\t\\tA pair! \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAVENANT \\n\\t\\t\\t(throwing down a card)\\n\\t\\tAce! \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC\\n\\t\\tOh, I nearly had you.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAVENANT \\n\\t\\t\\t(laughing)\\n\\t\\tThat\\'s not good enough! \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC \\n\\t\\t\\t(picking up the cards \\n\\t\\t\\tand shuffling them) \\n\\t\\tMy deal. \\n\\nThe usurer bursts into the house.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE USURER \\n\\t\\t\\t(angrily) \\n\\t\\tYou cheats! Give me my money! \\n\\nHe tries to pick up the money from the table. Ludovic strikes him and knocks \\nhim out.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC\\n\\t\\tWhat shall we do?\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAVENANT \\n\\t\\tThrow him out. The streets are empty at this \\n\\t\\ttime of night.\\n \\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC\\n\\t\\tWhat time is it? Wait a minute.\\n \\nHe leans down and takes the watch and chain off the usurer\\'s frock coat. He \\nlooks at it.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC \\n\\t\\t\\t(grinning) \\n\\t\\tTen o\\'clock. \\n\\nHe puts the watch inside his jacket.\\n \\n \\n\\nAt the castle.\\n \\nBeauty is lying on the bed. The Beast walks over to the foot of the bed.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST\\n\\t\\tBeauty, are you ill? \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY\\n\\t\\tYes, Beast. I am. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST \\n\\t\\tWhat ails you?\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\tI know my father\\'s dying.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST\\n\\t\\tI can\\'t bear to see you waste away.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\tSend me home to my father.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST \\n\\t\\tIf I agree, will you promise to return in a \\n\\t\\tweek\\'s time, to the very day?\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\t\\t(smiling at him)\\n\\t\\tI promise.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST\\n\\t\\t\\t(going to the edge of the \\n\\t\\t\\tbed and putting out his hand)\\n\\t\\tCome with me, Beauty.\\n\\nHe helps her down from the bed and leads her through the French windows out \\nonto the balcony. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST\\n\\t\\tLook over there, Beauty. \\n\\nHe points to an ornately decorated small pavilion.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST\\n\\t\\tYou see that pavilion? It\\'s called the pavilion \\n\\t\\tof Diana. It\\'s the only part of my domain where \\n\\t\\tno one may enter. Not even you or I. Everything \\n\\t\\tI possess, I possess by magic powers. But my \\n\\t\\ttrue riches lie locked in that pavilion. A \\n\\t\\tgolden key opens the door. Here it is ... \\n\\t\\t\\t(He shows her the key.) \\n\\t\\tBeauty, I couldn\\'t give you greater proof of my \\n\\t\\tfaith in you. If you don\\'t return I shall die. \\n\\t\\tAfter my death, you risk nothing more and all \\n\\t\\tmy riches will be yours. Take this key, Beauty. \\n\\t\\t\\t(He hands it to her.) \\n\\t\\tI have faith in you. The key will be your \\n\\t\\tpledge to return.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\t\\t(looking at him with \\n\\t\\t\\tan expression of joy)\\n\\t\\tYou agree to send me home to my father? \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST\\n\\t\\tYou\\'ll be there this very morning. My night \\n\\t\\there is not the same as yours. It is night in \\n\\t\\tmy world, but it is morning in yours. \\n\\t\\t\\t(He leads her hack into the room.) \\n\\t\\tBeauty, a rose that has already played its \\n\\t\\tpart, my mirror, my golden key, my horse and my \\n\\t\\tglove are the five secrets of my power ... I \\n\\t\\tsurrender them to you. \\n\\t\\t\\t(He removes his glove \\n\\t\\t\\tand gives it to her.) \\n\\t\\tJust put the glove on your right hand, it will \\n\\t\\tcarry you wherever you wish. \\n\\nHe walks slowly to the door, turns round and looks at her intently. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST\\n\\t\\tRemember your promise. \\n\\t\\t\\t(The door opens; he \\n\\t\\t\\tleaves the room.) \\n\\t\\tFarewell, Beauty.\\n \\nThe door closes silently behind him. Beauty paces up and down the room, \\nstaring at the glove. She puts it onto her right hand. In a flash she is \\ntransported to her father\\'s bedroom.\\n \\nThe merchant is sleeping. Beauty throws the glove onto the bed and sits down. \\nGently, she puts her hand out toward him. He wakes up. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE MERCHANT\\n\\t\\tI must be dreaming!\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY\\n\\t\\tNo, father, you\\'re not dreaming. It is I, \\n\\t\\tBeauty, talking to you.\\n \\n \\t\\t\\t\\tTHE MERCHANT\\n\\t\\tI thought you were dead, and it was killing me. \\n\\t\\tBut you managed to escape?\\n \\n \\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY\\n\\t\\tNo, father, the Beast set me free to visit you. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE MERCHANT\\n\\t\\tSo the monster has a heart.\\n \\n \\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\tHe suffers greatly, father. One half of him is \\n\\t\\tin constant struggle with the other. I think he \\n\\t\\tis more cruel to himself than he is to others.\\n \\n \\t\\t\\t\\tTHE MERCHANT\\n\\t\\tBut Beauty, I\\'ve seen him, he\\'s so hideous. \\n\\n \\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\tYes, at first he\\'s very frightening, father. \\n\\t\\tYet now, he sometimes makes me want to burst out \\n\\t\\tlaughing. Rut then I see his eyes, and they\\'re \\n\\t\\tso sad that I turn away so as not to weep. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE MERCHANT\\n\\t\\tBeauty, my little Beauty, don\\'t tell me that \\n\\t\\tyou\\'re willing to live with this monster!\\n \\n \\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY\\n\\t\\tI must father. Certain powers obey him, but \\n\\t\\tothers control him. If I escaped I\\'d be \\n\\t\\tcommitting a crime against him and against you.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE MERCHANT\\n\\t\\tDoes he threaten you?\\n \\n \\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY\\n\\t\\tHe only comes to me when his cruelty need not \\n\\t\\tbe feared. Sometimes his bearing is regal, but \\n\\t\\tsometimes he almost limps, as though he were \\n\\t\\tthe victim of some terrible affliction.\\n \\n \\t\\t\\t\\tTHE MERCHANT\\n\\t\\tHow can you feel sorry for him?\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\tI can bear his presence because I would be \\n\\t\\thappy if I could make him forget his ugliness.\\n \\n \\t\\t\\t\\tTHE MERCHANT\\n\\t\\tBeauty ... Beauty, you\\'re paying a high price \\n\\t\\tfor being so good.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY\\n\\t\\tBut father, the monster is good.\\n \\nA tear falls from her eyes onto her hand. It is magically transformed into a \\ndiamond.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE MERCHANT\\n\\t\\tGood God! A diamond!\\n \\nHe picks it up, looks at her, and puts his hand to her cheek where another \\ntear glistens. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE MERCHANT\\n\\t\\tAnother one!\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY\\n\\t\\tIt is proof that he is protected, for I wept \\n\\t\\tthinking of him. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE MERCHANT\\n\\t\\tMaybe the devil sent these diamonds! \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\tRest assured, father, keep them. They are a \\n\\t\\tgift from him. Now you\\'ll be able to support \\n\\t\\tyourself. But if you tell my sisters of this \\n\\t\\tmiracle, they\\'ll take them from you and you\\'ll \\n\\t\\thave nothing.\\n \\n \\n\\n\\nLater.\\n \\nOutside in the yard, Felicie and Adelaide are hanging up the washing. They \\nare dressed in peasant clothes. Ludovic is feeding the chickens.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE\\n\\t\\tI\\'d rather lie on the sheets than have to hang \\n\\t\\tthem up. My hands are in the most dreadful \\n\\t\\tstate!\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC \\n\\t\\t\\t(ironically) \\n\\t\\tHow appalling.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tADELAIDE\\n\\t\\tLook at mine! A kitchen maid! That\\'s what I\\'ve \\n\\t\\tbeen reduced to!\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC\\n\\t\\tWell, my lovely princesses, when one is \\n\\t\\tpenniless, one has to work! \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE\\n\\t\\tYou fool!\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tADELAIDE \\n\\t\\t\\t(to Ludovic)\\n\\t\\tYes, you can talk, you good-for-nothing. If we \\n\\t\\thadn\\'t lost all the furniture, we\\'d still have \\n\\t\\ta maid. \\n\\nAvenant is chopping wood across the yard.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAVENANT \\n\\t\\t\\t(joining them)\\n\\t\\tIt\\'s all my fault. And you may have noticed \\n\\t\\tthat I\\'m paying for it now.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tADELAIDE \\n\\t\\tYes, when you\\'re not drinking or gambling.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAVENANT\\n\\t\\tOh, you\\'re so charming. \\n\\t\\t\\t(He pauses.)\\n\\t\\tHow was your father this morning?\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC\\n\\t\\tAs if they cared! I\\'m the only one that looks \\n\\t\\tafter him. He\\'s still very weak. He can\\'t get \\n\\t\\tup.\\n \\nSuddenly they hear the merchant shouting in a strong voice. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE MERCHANT\\n\\t\\tFelicie! Adelaide! Ludovic!\\n\\nFelicie climbs up onto a stool and peers out over the line of washing. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE \\n\\t\\tWell, I never! A lady from the court, walking \\n\\t\\twith my father!\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tADELAIDE \\n\\t\\tAnd here we are dressed in rags!\\n \\n \\t\\t\\t\\tAVENANT\\n\\t\\tIt\\'s Beauty! \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC\\n\\t\\tBeauty! It can\\'t be! \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tADELAIDE \\n\\t\\tIt is!\\n\\nThe merchant and Beauty walk across the yard. Beauty looks like a princess. \\nShe is wearing a long white silk dress with full sleeves and a low-cut \\nneckline. Her hair flows down her back in elaborate curls, and on her head \\nshe wears a jeweled coronet from which floats a translucent pearl-studded \\ntrain.  Her only piece of jewelry is a magnificent pearl necklace with a \\ndiamond clasp. The two sisters stare at her in disbelief. Avenant helps \\nFelicie down off the stool.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE\\n\\t\\tLeave me alone, will you!\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAVENANT\\n\\t\\tYou become sweeter by the moment. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE MERCHANT\\n\\t\\tBeauty came to my room and cured me. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC\\n\\t\\tWhere have you come from? \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE \\n\\t\\t\\t(staring greedily at \\n\\t\\t\\tBeauty\\'s necklace) \\n\\t\\tWhat a magnificent necklace!\\n \\n \\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\t\\t(removing it and \\n\\t\\t\\toffering it to her)\\n\\t\\tTake it, Felicie, it will look even better on \\n\\t\\tyou.\\n \\nFelicie grabs it eagerly. It turns into a bunch of dirty twisted rags. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE MERCHANT\\n\\t\\tMy God! \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tADELAIDE\\n\\t\\tPut it down!\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE\\n\\t\\tHow disgusting!\\n \\nShe drops it. As it touches the ground it turns back into pearls. The \\nMerchant picks up the necklace and puts it on Beauty. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE MERCHANT\\n\\t\\tWhat the Beast gave you is for you alone. You \\n\\t\\tcan\\'t give it away.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE \\n\\t\\t\\t(angrily)\\n\\t\\tCome on Adelaide, let\\'s go and get dressed. We \\n\\t\\tmust look simply ghastly.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC\\n\\t\\tGood-bye, you sweet young things! \\n\\nThe two sisters stalk out of the yard.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\t\\t(looking at the \\n\\t\\t\\twashing on the line)\\n\\t\\tWho did my washing? \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAVENANT\\n\\t\\tWe did!\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\tThe sheets are badly hung, they\\'re trailing on \\n\\t\\tthe ground. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC\\n\\t\\tSo, this Beast wasn\\'t savage? \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\tNo, Ludovic, he\\'s a good beast. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAVENANT\\n\\t\\tYou\\'re not going back to him, are you?\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\tI must, Avenant, I promised. The Beast set me \\n\\t\\tfree for one week, and if I don\\'t return he\\'ll \\n\\t\\tdie of heartbreak. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAVENANT \\n\\t\\t\\t(angrily) \\n\\t\\tDo you love him?\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY\\n\\t\\tNo, Avenant, I\\'m fond of him. It\\'s not the same \\n\\t\\tthing.\\n \\n\\n\\nInside the house, the two sisters are dressing.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tADELAIDE \\n\\t\\tThe Church Committee would be most interested \\n\\t\\tin that little exhibition of witchcraft we\\'ve \\n\\t\\tjust witnessed.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nIn the yard.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE MERCHANT \\n\\t\\t\\t(kissing Beauty on the cheek)\\n\\t\\tI\\'ll see you later. \\n\\nHe leaves.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC\\n\\t\\tLet\\'s go to the stable. We can talk seriously \\n\\t\\tthere. My dear sisters won\\'t be able to hear \\n\\t\\tus.\\n \\nThey walk across the yard and go into the stable.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC\\n\\t\\tTell us everything.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\t\\t(sitting down on a wooden bench) \\n\\t\\tHe gave me the key to all his treasures. He \\n\\t\\ttrusts me implicitly. I\\'d be the monster if I \\n\\t\\tdidn\\'t return to him.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC\\n\\t\\tWhat about your servants? Are there many?\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\tInvisible hands serve me, dress me, arrange my \\n\\t\\thair, open and close the doors. I never see \\n\\t\\tanyone.\\n \\n \\t\\t\\t\\tAVENANT\\n\\t\\tAnd this Beast speaks like a human being?\\n \\n \\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY\\n\\t\\tYes, Avenant, he speaks just like you and I do.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC \\n\\t\\tDoes he crawl on all fours? What does he drink? \\n\\t\\tWhat does he eat?\\n \\n \\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\tSometimes I help him drink -- and I know he\\'ll \\n\\t\\tnever eat me.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nInside the house. The two sisters are dressed up in all their finery. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE \\n\\t\\tWell, I never! \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tADELAIDE\\n\\t\\tIt\\'s incredible!\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE\\n\\t\\tThat little fool is happier than we are -- and \\n\\t\\tshe\\'s rich. After all, so many husbands are no \\n\\t\\tbetter than her Beast. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tADELAIDE\\n\\t\\tShe\\'s bursting with pride!\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE\\n\\t\\tDon\\'t worry, I\\'ve got a good head on my \\n\\t\\tshoulders. We must be very friendly and let the \\n\\t\\tboys worm out her secrets.\\n \\n \\n\\n\\nLater.\\n\\nDownstairs. Avenant and Ludovic are sitting at the table. Ludovic empties his \\npockets.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAVENANT\\n\\t\\tShow me how much you\\'ve got.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC \\n\\t\\t\\t(throwing a coin onto the table) \\n\\t\\tThere you are. It\\'s pretty bad.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAVENANT\\n\\t\\tWe must do something. I\\'ve come to a decision. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC\\n\\t\\tThere\\'s nothing we can do.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAVENANT\\n\\t\\tLudovic, the idea of Beauty returning to that \\n\\t\\tBeast tomorrow is intolerable. We must slay \\n\\t\\tthe Beast. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC\\n\\t\\tAnd take his treasure! But do you appreciate \\n\\t\\tthe power of magic? \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAVENANT\\n\\t\\tI don\\'t believe in magic. I\\'m sure the monster \\n\\t\\thypnotizes Beauty and makes her believe anything \\n\\t\\the wants her to.\\n \\n \\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC\\n\\t\\tI\\'m scared.\\n \\n \\t\\t\\t\\tAVENANT\\n\\t\\tWhen it comes to rescuing Beauty no magic power \\n\\t\\tin the world could scare me. Anyway we have no \\n\\t\\tchoice. So don\\'t be ridiculous. Butter up your \\n\\t\\tsisters -- when they see what\\'s in it for them, \\n\\t\\tthey\\'ll stop Beauty from leaving. Tempt them \\n\\t\\twith the promise of riches.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC\\n\\t\\tAnd by what miracle will you find the Beast? \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAVENANT\\n\\t\\tI\\'ll question Beauty and find out her secret.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLater.\\n \\nIn the kitchen.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE \\n\\t\\tWe\\'ll rub our eyes with onions and pretend to \\n\\t\\tcry. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tADELAIDE \\n\\t\\t\\t(holding up an onion)\\n\\t\\tShe\\'ll smell it. Ludovic\\'s ideas are ludicrous.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE\\n\\t\\tShe\\'s too stupid to notice. Ludovic\\'s idea \\n\\t\\tisn\\'t all that silly. Leave it to me. \\n\\nShe hands the onion to Adelaide who rubs it in Felicie\\'s face. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE\\n\\t\\tCharming! ... Go on ... go on ... \\n\\nThey run into Beauty\\'s room, holding handkerchiefs to their faces. Beauty is \\nwearing her simple peasant clothes.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE \\n\\t\\t\\t(dramatically)\\n\\t\\tBeauty, you can\\'t leave us, you mustn\\'t go! \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tADELAIDE \\n\\t\\t\\t(flinging herself to her \\n\\t\\t\\tknees at Beauty\\'s feet)\\n\\t\\tBeauty, stay with us!\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE\\n\\t\\tI know we have been unfair to you, but at the \\n\\t\\tthought of losing you we realize just how much \\n\\t\\twe love you! \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY\\n\\t\\tYou\\'re crying!\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE \\n\\t\\t\\t(pretending to sob)\\n\\t\\tIf the Beast loves you, he won\\'t mind if you \\n\\t\\tstay a little longer.\\n \\n \\t\\t\\t\\tADELAIDE \\n\\t\\tStay another week! \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY\\n\\t\\tIt\\'s not possible.\\n \\n \\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE \\n\\t\\tDo you want us to die of heartbreak? Your \\n\\t\\tfather? Your sisters? Stay ... Stay, Beauty \\n\\t\\t... Stay with us!\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\t\\t(turning away) \\n\\t\\tI can\\'t. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE\\n\\t\\tDon\\'t be cruel. Stay! \\n\\nAdelaide pretends to sob hysterically.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\t\\t(stroking her forehead)\\n\\t\\tAdelaide, Adelaide! My dear sister. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE \\n\\t\\tAdelaide said to me, \"We have got our dear \\n\\t\\tBeauty back. I shall die if she leaves!\"\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\tDon\\'t tempt me. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tADELAIDE\\n\\t\\tBeauty!\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE \\n\\t\\tDon\\'t abandon us tomorrow. Tell the Beast that \\n\\t\\tit was your sisters\\' fault.\\n \\nShe turns away in false despair and walks over to the dressing table. She \\nsees the golden key lying there and snatches it while no one is looking.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\t\\t(sighing)\\n\\t\\tI didn\\'t realize that you were so fond of me. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE \\n\\t\\t\\t(smiling falsely) \\n\\t\\tYou\\'re an angel. \\n\\nShe runs up to Beauty and embraces her. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tADELAIDE \\n\\t\\t\\t(kissing her) \\n\\t\\tWe\\'re so happy! So happy! \\n\\nBeauty throws herself onto the bed in despair. The sisters leave the room.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tADELAIDE\\n\\t\\tOh, I\\'m so happy!\\n \\nFelicie closes the door behind her and listens.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE \\n\\t\\tShe\\'s crying!\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tADELAIDE \\n\\t\\tShe\\'ll stay behind, and we\\'ll share all the \\n\\t\\ttreasure! \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE \\n\\t\\tLet\\'s wash our faces. You stink! \\n\\nThey go downstairs. Ludovic is waiting for them. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC\\n\\t\\tWell? \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE\\n\\t\\tWell what? \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC\\n\\t\\tIs she staying? \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE \\n\\t\\tShe\\'s staying.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC\\n\\t\\tDid you get the key? \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE \\n\\t\\tLook! \\n\\nShe opens her hand.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC\\n\\t\\tGive it to me.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE \\n\\t\\t\\t(putting her hand behind her back) \\n\\t\\tWhat do you take me for?\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tADELAIDE \\n\\t\\t\\t(to Ludovic)\\n\\t\\tWho knows what you\\'d do with it; it\\'s solid \\n\\t\\tgold, you know. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC\\n\\t\\tYou stupid fool.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE\\n\\t\\tDon\\'t start fighting. I\\'ll give it to Avenant \\n\\t\\t-- if he decides to go.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC\\n\\t\\tOh, women! You really are incredible! Typical. \\n\\t\\tGo how? Go where?\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE \\n\\t\\t\\t(shrugging her shoulders) \\n\\t\\tAvenant will just have to find a way.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nLater.\\n\\nThe family is dining.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE MERCHANT\\n\\t\\tBeauty, you seem so sad. \\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY\\n\\t\\tNo, I\\'m not, father. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE \\n\\t\\tShe misses her luxuries. Our wretched way of \\n\\t\\tlife upsets her.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE MERCHANT \\n\\t\\t\\t(angrily)\\n\\t\\tFelicie! Felicie!\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tADELAIDE\\n\\t\\tThe Beast must have certain attractions that \\n\\t\\twe don\\'t possess.\\n \\nBeauty gets up to serve the wine.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE MERCHANT\\n\\t\\tOh!\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE \\n\\t\\tDoubtless Madam feels that it\\'s beneath her to \\n\\t\\twait on us. \\n\\nBeauty runs out of the room. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE MERCHANT\\n\\t\\tBeauty! Beauty!\\n \\nShe goes outside with her head in her hands, sobbing. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAVENANT \\n\\t\\t\\t(coming up to her) \\n\\t\\tWhat have they done to you now? It\\'s your \\n\\t\\tsisters, isn\\'t it? They didn\\'t wait long! Damn \\n\\t\\tit! Beauty, listen to me, don\\'t cry. I must wake \\n\\t\\tyou from this nightmare. I must take you away. \\n\\t\\tI know what you\\'re thinking -- that I\\'m a good-\\n\\t\\tfor-nothing. But with you beside me, I\\'d work. \\n\\t\\tWe\\'d leave the town and its taverns behind us. \\n\\t\\tAnswer me. \\n\\t\\t\\t(She is silent.)\\n\\t\\tWhat is it? I see, it\\'s the Beast. Tell me how \\n\\t\\tto get to him, I\\'ll go and kill him. \\n\\t\\t\\t(He pauses.)\\n\\t\\tYou don\\'t answer. I was sure of it; the Beast \\n\\t\\thas bewitched you or at least you can\\'t bring \\n\\t\\tyourself to wish him harm. \\n\\t\\t\\t(Beauty listens to him \\n\\t\\t\\twith tears in her eyes.) \\n\\t\\tWell, Beauty, let me tell you -- that monster \\n\\t\\tcan\\'t be suffering as I do or he would fly to \\n\\t\\tyou and make you follow him. Rest assured, \\n\\t\\tBeauty, he has forgotten you.\\n \\nShe shakes her head and leaves him.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nLater. At the castle.\\n \\nThe Beast is pacing up and down in Beauty\\'s room. He looks at his bare right \\nhand in despair. He goes over to the dressing table and fingers the mirror. \\nHe walks slowly round the room and stares at the empty bed. He picks up the \\nfur bedspread and strokes it, as he holds it to his cheek and clutches it to \\nhis breast with a look of anguish.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nLater.\\n \\nAt the merchant\\'s house. The stable.\\n\\nFelicie opens the door to let in Avenant and Ludovic. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE \\n\\t\\tCome in, no one will find us here. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tADELAIDE\\n\\t\\tYou\\'re late, of course. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE \\n\\t\\tWell? \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAVENANT\\n\\t\\tI have reached a decision. There\\'s no looking \\n\\t\\tback now! \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC\\n\\t\\tThat\\'s all very well, but how can we get to the \\n\\t\\tBeast? \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE\\n\\t\\tDidn\\'t you find out how Beauty got here?\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAVENANT\\n\\t\\tBeauty only tells us what the Beast has allowed \\n\\t\\ther to tell. We know every detail about the \\n\\t\\tdomain, but she won\\'t say anymore.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE\\n\\t\\tTo hell with her; if she won\\'t tell, I\\'ll \\n\\t\\ttorture her till she does!\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAVENANT\\n\\t\\tIf you do that, don\\'t count on any more help \\n\\t\\tfrom me! \\n\\t\\t\\t(They hear a sound.)\\n\\t\\tWhat\\'s that? I\\'ll go and see. \\n\\nHe goes to the door. The Magnificent One trots into the yard. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAVENANT\\n\\t\\tA riderless white horse! It\\'s the Magnificent \\n\\t\\tOne, I\\'m sure. He jumped over the gate and came \\n\\t\\tinto the yard. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE\\n\\t\\tHeaven sent him!\\n \\n \\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC \\n\\t\\tMore likely Hell. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tADELAIDE\\n\\t\\tI\\'m scared!\\n \\n \\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE \\n\\t\\tShut up, you fool. Avenant, open the door \\n\\t\\tquietly and bring him in.\\n \\n \\t\\t\\t\\tAVENANT\\n\\t\\tDon\\'t move, I\\'ll go.\\n \\nHe goes out into the yard and leads the horse into the stable.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE \\n\\t\\tThe Beast has sent him for Beauty. What luck. \\n\\t\\tAvenant, the horse can take you and Ludovic to \\n\\t\\tthe domain.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC\\n\\t\\tIt\\'s easy for you to talk!\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE \\n\\t\\tAre you a man, or aren\\'t you?\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAVENANT\\n\\t\\tWe mustn\\'t waste a second. \\n\\t\\t\\t(He mounts the horse.)\\n\\t\\tCome on, Ludovic, jump up behind me.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC \\n\\t\\t\\t(getting up behind him) \\n\\t\\tMay God protect us. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE \\n\\t\\t\\t(picking up their bows and arrows) \\n\\t\\tYour bows! \\n\\nShe hands them to Avenant. He looks down. Something is hanging from the \\nsaddle.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAVENANT\\n\\t\\tWhat\\'s that?\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE \\n\\t\\tIt\\'s a bag. If it were gold, I\\'d only have to \\n\\t\\ttouch it and it would turn to straw. \\n\\t\\t\\t(to Adelaide) \\n\\t\\tOpen it.\\n \\n \\t\\t\\t\\tADELAIDE \\n\\t\\t\\t(looking inside the bag)\\n\\t\\tA mirror!\\n \\nShe takes it out. It\\'s the mirror from Beauty\\'s room in the castle.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE \\n\\t\\tHis message to her is clear: Look and you will \\n\\t\\tsee the ugly face of a girl who breaks her \\n\\t\\tpromises.\\n \\n \\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC \\n\\t\\tYou see, the Beast\\'s not all that stupid after \\n\\t\\tall. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE\\n\\t\\t\\t(giving Avenant the key) \\n\\t\\tHere\\'s the key -- off you go, and good luck!\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAVENANT\\n\\t\\tI\\'ve forgotten the magic words.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC\\n\\t\\tIt\\'s something like \"Go, go.\" \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE\\n\\t\\tIf I depended on you we\\'d get nowhere! Go where \\n\\t\\tI am going, Magnificent One, go, go.\\n\\n \\t\\t\\t\\tAVENANT\\n\\t\\tGo where I am going, Magnificent One, go, go. \\n\\nThe horse neighs and gallops out of the yard. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tADELAIDE\\n\\t\\t\\t(running after them) \\n\\t\\tLudovic! \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE\\n\\t\\tWhat\\'s the matter?\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tADELAIDE\\n\\t\\tSuppose we\\'ve sent them to their death ...\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE\\n\\t\\tDon\\'t be stupid. \\n\\t\\t\\t(They go into the house.) \\n\\t\\tThe mirror! \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tADELAIDE\\n\\t\\tI don\\'t feel happy about it.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE \\n\\t\\t\\t(holding up the mirror)\\n\\t\\tLook at you, green with fear. \\n\\nAdelaide lets out a cry of horror. The mirror reflects the cruel and ugly \\nface of an old hag. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tADELAIDE\\n\\t\\tLook!\\n\\nShe holds the mirror up to Felicie. Felicie looks into it and sees an ape.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE \\n\\t\\tOh!\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tADELAIDE \\n\\t\\tWhat can you see? \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE \\n\\t\\tNothing. Let\\'s take it to Beauty, it\\'s her \\n\\t\\tturn. \\n\\nThey go to Beauty\\'s room. She is wearing the fabulous clothes and jewels that \\nshe had on when she arrived.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE \\n\\t\\tAh! So Madam dolls herself up like a princess \\n\\t\\twhen she\\'s alone in her room.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tADELAIDE\\n\\t\\tYes, just who do you think you are?\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFELICIE\\n\\t\\tHere, Beauty, here\\'s a mirror that was \\n\\t\\tmysteriously left at the door for you. \\n\\t\\t\\t(She throws it on the bed.) \\n\\t\\tTo show you how a Beauty must look to please a \\n\\t\\tBeast. \\n\\nThey leave the room.\\n\\nBeauty goes over to the bed and picks up the mirror. She holds it to her \\ncheek and props it up on the dressing table. She lies down on the bed and \\nstares into it. At first she sees her own reflection. Then the Beast appears \\nto her, with a look of intense suffering. The mirror goes black. Beauty lies \\nback on the bed in despair. Suddenly she sits up. She looks at the mirror \\nagain, hurriedly picks up the Beast\\'s glove which is lying next to it and \\nputs it on her right hand.\\n \\nShe is transported to her bed in the castle. She removes the glove and sits \\nup.\\n \\n \\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\tOh! the key! \\n\\nShe puts the glove on again. She is taken back to the house. She removes the \\nglove and looks round the room for the key.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\tThe key! \\n\\t\\t\\t(desperately) \\n\\t\\tWhere is the key? My God! \\n\\nShe throws herself onto the bed and hurriedly puts on the glove again.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nBack in her room in the castle, she rushes to the door which opens silently \\nbefore her.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY\\n\\t\\tBeast! My Beast! \\n\\nShe runs out of the castle, down the stone staircase. She stops and searches \\nin vain for the Beast.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY\\n\\t\\tBeast!  \\n\\t\\t\\t(in despair)  \\n\\t\\tBeast!  \\n\\nShe runs through the garden shouting for him. Suddenly she sees him lying on \\nthe ground by the edge of the pool. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY\\n\\t\\tMy Beast! \\n\\nShe runs to his side and kneels over him. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY\\n\\t\\tMy Beast, answer me, Beast! Oh, my Beast, \\n\\t\\tforgive me! \\n\\t\\t\\t(She tries to lift up his head.) \\n\\t\\tAnswer me, Beast. Look at me. Your glove will \\n\\t\\trevive you. \\n\\t\\t\\t(She puts it on his right hand.) \\n\\t\\tHelp me! \\n\\t\\t\\t(She looks at him.) \\n\\t\\tI\\'m the monster, Beast. You shall live, you \\n\\t\\tshall live!\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST \\n\\t\\t\\t(whispering)\\n\\t\\tIt\\'s too late.\\n \\nMeanwhile, Avenant and Ludovic have reached the pavilion.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC \\n\\t\\tWe\\'re here!\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAVENANT\\n\\t\\tYes, we\\'re here. First we must kill the Beast. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC\\n\\t\\tWe\\'ll kill him later. Have you got the key? \\n\\nAvenant brings out the key and is about to put it into the lock.\\n  \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC\\n\\t\\tWait! This key may release some evil trap. We \\n\\t\\tmust be very careful.\\n \\n \\t\\t\\t\\tAVENANT\\n\\t\\tYou\\'re right. We won\\'t go in through the door. \\n\\t\\tFollow me.\\n \\nThey walk round the side of the pavilion. The walls are covered in plants. \\nAvenant tests the branches.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAVENANT\\n\\t\\tClimb up after me. \\n\\t\\t\\t(Ludovic hesitates.) \\n\\t\\tCome on, take heart. You\\'re scared of course. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC\\n\\t\\tI\\'m not scared, I\\'m thinking.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAVENANT\\n\\t\\tIt looks the same to me. Are you coming? \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC \\n\\t\\t\\t(following him up onto the roof) \\n\\t\\tWhere are we? \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAVENANT\\n\\t\\tWe\\'re on a skylight. \\n\\nHe pulls back the foliage and peers down into the pavilion.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAVENANT\\n\\t\\tLook!\\n \\nThey gaze down at innumerable jewels, gold and other treasures piled up \\naround a statue in the middle of the pavilion. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC\\n\\t\\tIt\\'s fantastic! \\n\\t\\t\\t(He points to the statue.) \\n\\t\\tWhat\\'s that? \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAVENANT\\n\\t\\tThe goddess Diana.\\n \\nMeanwhile, Beauty is still desperately trying to revive the Beast. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY\\n\\t\\tYou\\'re no coward, I know the strength of your \\n\\t\\tclaws. Clutch at life with them, fight! Sit up, \\n\\t\\troar, frighten death away!\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE BEAST \\n\\t\\tBeauty, if I were a man ... doubtless I would \\n\\t\\t... do as you say ... but poor beasts who would \\n\\t\\tprove their love ... only know ... how to lie \\n\\t\\ton the ground ... and die.\\n \\nHe gives her a look full of tenderness and dies.\\n\\n\\nOn the roof of the pavilion Avenant is spurred into action by the sight of \\nthe Beast\\'s treasure.\\n  \\n \\t\\t\\t\\tAVENANT\\n\\t\\tI\\'m going to break the pane. \\n\\t\\t\\t(Ludovic tries to hold him back.) \\n\\t\\tLeave me alone! \\n\\t\\t\\t(He breaks the glass with \\n\\t\\t\\tthe heel of his boot.) \\n\\t\\tAfter all, it\\'s only glass. You hold me by the \\n\\t\\tarms, and lower me down as far as possible, \\n\\t\\tthen I\\'ll jump.\\n \\n \\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC \\n\\t\\tIt\\'s too high. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAVENANT\\n\\t\\tI\\'ll jump. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLUDOVIC\\n\\t\\tHow will we get the treasure out?\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAVENANT\\n\\t\\tWe\\'ll think of something. First we\\'ve got to \\n\\t\\tget in there. Stand square on your feet. \\n\\t\\t\\t(Ludovic takes hold of his arm.) \\n\\t\\tGet a good grip.\\n \\nLudovic lowers Avenant down through the skylight. The statue of Diana comes \\nto life, puts an arrow in her bow and aims at Avenant.\\n \\n \\t\\t\\t\\tAVENANT\\n\\t\\tWait, wait Ludovic, don\\'t let go yet. Wait \\n\\t\\tuntil I tell you to.\\n \\nDiana shoots the arrow. It hits Avenant between his shoulder blades. He lets \\nout a cry. Ludovic stares at him in horror. Before his very eyes Avenant\\'s \\nfeatures turn into those of the Beast. Ludovic lets go of him, he falls to \\nthe ground -- there is no sign of the treasure, only dead leaves and \\nbranches.\\n \\n\\n\\nAt the edge of the pool Beauty starts back with a cry.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY\\n\\t\\tWhere is the Beast?\\n \\nA handsome young man stands in front of her.\\n \\n \\t\\t\\t\\tTHE PRINCE\\n\\t\\tThe Beast is no more. It was I, Beauty. My \\n\\t\\tparents wouldn\\'t believe in fairy tales. The \\n\\t\\tfairies punished them through me. I could only \\n\\t\\tbe saved by a look of love.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\t\\t(amazed) \\n\\t\\tAre such miracles possible?\\n \\n \\t\\t\\t\\tTHE PRINCE\\n\\t\\tWe are the proof. Love can make a Beast of a \\n\\t\\tman. It can also make an ugly man handsome. \\n\\t\\t\\t(She looks away) \\n\\t\\tWhat is it Beauty? Do you regret my ugliness?\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\tNo, my Lord. You resemble someone I once knew. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE PRINCE\\n\\t\\tWho?\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY\\n\\t\\tMy brother\\'s friend. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE PRINCE\\n\\t\\tYou loved him? \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY\\n\\t\\tYes.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE PRINCE\\n\\t\\tDid he know? \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\tNo.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE PRINCE\\n\\t\\tBut you loved the Beast? \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\tYes, I did.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE PRINCE\\n\\t\\tYou are a strange girl, Beauty, a strange girl \\n\\t\\tindeed. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\t\\t(kneeling at his feet) \\n\\t\\tI am at your service.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE PRINCE \\n\\t\\t\\t(lifting her to her feet) \\n\\t\\tDoes my resemblance to your brother\\'s friend \\n\\t\\tdisplease you?\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\t\\t(turning away) \\n\\t\\tYes ... \\n\\t\\t\\t(She turns back to him and smiles.) \\n\\t\\tNo.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE PRINCE \\n\\t\\t\\t(taking her in his arms) \\n\\t\\tThe first time I carried you in my arms I was \\n\\t\\tthe Beast ... \\n\\nIn the pavilion the remains of the Beast lie smoking on the ground.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE PRINCE \\n\\t\\tAre you happy? \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY\\n\\t\\tI shall have to get accustomed to you. Where \\n\\t\\twill you take me?\\n \\n \\t\\t\\t\\tTHE PRINCE\\n\\t\\tTo my kingdom, where you will be Queen. There \\n\\t\\tyou\\'ll find your father, and your sisters will \\n\\t\\tcarry your train. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\tIs it far?\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE PRINCE\\n\\t\\tWe\\'ll fly through the air. \\n\\t\\t\\t(He picks her up in his arms.) \\n\\t\\tYou won\\'t be afraid, will you?\\n \\n \\t \\t\\t\\tBEAUTY \\n\\t\\tI don\\'t mind being afraid ... with you.\\n \\nHe carries her out into the courtyard. In the pavilion dead leaves flutter \\nonto the remains of the Beast. The Prince kisses Beauty\\'s hand.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTHE PRINCE\\n\\t\\tBeauty! I will take you! Come, away! \\n\\nHand in hand they are magically carried aloft through the clouds into the sky.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe End\\n \\n\\n\\n \\nScreenplay by Jean Cocteau\\n\\n\\n\\n'"
