Now the crucial thing is the\\nbar codes on the label. That's\\nthose little bar codes, you know?\\nThe universal product codes?\\n\\nLENA\\nYeah.\\n\\nBARRY\\nThat's what's used to redeem the\\nmileage, so in noticing the\\npudding, each cup had an individual\\nbar code -- in other words: Two\\ndollars and fifty cents for ten\\ncups of pudding is 500 miles.

The room\\nwithin is panelled with mixrors set at odd angles, and\\nmirrored doors that swing open and close, catching and losing\\nreflections. A row of big crystal chandeliers down the length\\nof the room add myriad prismatic lights to the confusion.\\n\\nA number of Arab men, perhaps as many as twenty, are moving\\n\\nlarge wooden boxes around.

He's talking to someone, smoking a\\ncigarette.\\n\\nAvner's focusing the glasses, bringing Salameh nearer. The\\nsounds of the night intensify, the music, Arabic conversation\\nfrom the house, crickets, the distant surf and Avner\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s own\\nbreathing.\\n\\nSalameh suddenly stops talking, takes a deep drag on his\\ncigarette -- and then he seems to look straight out the\\nfrench doors of the library, out through their panes of\\ndistorting colored glass, out into the dark, as if seeking\\nout and then locking directly with Avner\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s gaze.\\n\\nOne of the mirrored doors behind Salameh opens, then another,\\nthen another, and all at once the face in the binoculars is\\nrepeated, over and over, full face, profile, rear view,\\nstaring hard at something -- it seems to be Avner -- with a\\nstrange expression: familiarity, hatred, taunting.\\n\\nCUT BACK TO236\\n\\nSTEVE\\nToo many Men.

His body topples back into the bushes.\\n\\nAvner and Steve hear shouts coming from inside the house.\\nSomeone in the dining room flings the door opens and calls\\nout something in Arabic. They crouch, edging back into the\\nshadows. Suddenly there's a burst of machine-gun fire,\\nsending stone and gravel and dirt flying.\\n\\nSteve starts to run back towards the shore. Avner catches\\nhis arm, spins him around and drags him in the opposite\\ndirection. Avner runs in this direction, and Steve follows.\\n\\nAs they approach the main gates Avner trips, stumbles,\\ncutting his face. He sits there, stunned.

The\\ngates burst open, and Avner and Steve run pell-mell down the\\ndrive. Noises of pursuit, running, shouting, from within the\\ncompound grow closer. There's a burst of gunfire nearby.\\nAvner and Steve run down the road at top speed.\\n\\nNo one is pursuing. They keep running.\\n\\nCLOSE UP:\\nAvner runs, as we'd seen him at the start of the sequence:\\nface blacked, bloody cut, sweat, terror. He plunges into the\\ngrass field. He runs through the grass.\\n\\nHe throws his rifle away into the grass and runs.\\n\\nHis speed accelerates. He runs till the world falls away.
