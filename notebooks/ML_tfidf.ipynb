IRANIAN BUS - AFTERNOON\\nCamera powers up, jostles around until it settles on --\\n\\nThe floor of a third world bus. Middle Eastern legs,\\ntraditional Arabian dresses to the floor, homemade bags,\\nanimals everywhere. A chaotic scene with men, women, children\\nall shouting in Farsi. Brief glimpses of a mountainous\\nlandscape through the shaky windows. This bus could really\\nuse some new shocks and a better muffler.\\n\\nThe camera rises, turns around revealing its operator, a\\nWOMAN wearing a hajib (a traditional Arabian headdress). She\\nslumps low in her seat for privacy, looks around cautiously,\\nand carefully lowers her veil revealing --\\n\\nSCARLETT DURANG, mid 20s, an adventurous British\\narchaeologist. The kind of cat that gets killed by curiosity.\\nHer off-the-charts intellect and multiple post-grad degrees\\nare barely concealed by her striking good looks and punk rock\\ninclinations.\\n\\nJudging from the cloth that edges frame, she is obviously\\nshooting with a small camera attached to her hajib.\\n\\nShe whispers to the camera - alert, but not scared.\\n\\nSCARLETT\\nI'm approximately 20 miles inside\\nthe Iranian border en route to the\\nHabala region where they have\\nordered the destruction of a\\nnetwork of caves at sundown\\ntonight. I believe these caves\\nmight contain a critical missing\\npiece of our history.

HABALA PROVINCE - SUNSET\\nSun is almost touching the horizon.\\nThe camera shakes as Scarlett crosses through a sparsely\\npopulated marketplace as megaphones in the background demand\\neveryone clear the area.\\nScarlett is careful to keep pace with REZA, a mousy Persian\\nwith a neatly trimmed moustache and a weathered knockoff\\nTommy Hilfiger T-shirt. He leads her to a small, rock hut of\\na home.\\nREZA\\nHurry! Come!\\nINT. POOR IRANIAN HOME - SUNSET\\nThe camera follows Reza into a shanty.\\nREZA\\nIf they catch you here it would be\\n\\nvery bad for you.\\n\\nSCARLETT\\nYeah. I know.\\n\\nReza nods to his WIFE, in traditional garb. She nods back and\\nslides some sooty wooden shelves aside revealing --\\n\\nA PERSON-SIZED HOLE IN THE FLOOR THAT QUICKLY FADES TO\\nDARKNESS .\\n\\nScarlett smiles.\\n\\nShe shines her mini flashlight into the hole, the ground is\\nabout 10 feet down.\\n\\nShe gets ready to climb in.\\n\\nREZA\\nWait. You\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00991l need this.\\n\\nReza grabs a homemade rope ladder that\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s tied to the base of\\nthe stove and drops it into the hole.\\n\\fINT. HABALA CAVES - SUNSET\\nScarlett climbs into the dark cavern.\\n\\nAs the camera crosses the threshold it moves into near total\\ndarkness. Background sound from the streets above become\\nfaint echoes.\\n\\nReza drops down right behind her.\\n\\nA grinding sound as Reza\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s wife slides the bookshelves back\\ninto place, obliterating the light above.\\n\\nOnce Scarlett gets her footing, she shines her flashlight\\ndown the cave corridor. It's long and dark. It's about 4 feet\\ntall, forcing Scarlett and Reza into a crouched scamper.\\n\\nREZA\\nWe don\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t have much time. They have\\nalready cleared the area.\\n\\nThey race deeper and deeper into the cave.\\n\\nA MEGAPHONE SQUALL. THEY JUMP. SOMEONE SPEAKS FARSI INTO A\\nMEGAPHONE RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER -- COMING TOWARD THEM!\\n\\nThey race back and take cover behind a rock. Scarlett grabs a\\nrock off the floor in case she needs to use it as a weapon.\\n\\nAn ARMED GUARD passes, calling instructions out into the\\nmegaphone. If he just looks over his shoulder, he\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00991l see\\nthem. But he doesn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t.\\n\\nREZA (CONT'D)\\nWe need to leave.

He\\nreluctantly continues.\\n\\nREZA\\nHurry!\\n\\nThey race through one last corridor, then arrive at their\\ndestination --\\n\\nREZA (CONT'D)\\nThere.\\n\\nScarlett races to it - a wall full of ancient Coptic\\nChristian inscriptions.\\n\\nSCARLETT\\n(whispers )\\nIt\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s even more beautiful than the\\npictures.\\n\\nShe runs her fingers through the grooves as if she\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s reading\\nbraille. She quietly reads aloud in an ancient tongue.\\n\\nREZA\\nWe must hurry. Please!\\n\\nThe camera seems to drift down, and she resets it a couple\\ntimes until--\\n\\nSCARLETT\\n\\nHow can anyone think straight with\\nthese head covers falling all\\n\\nShe anxiously whips the veil off her head and throws it down\\non the floor beside her, RE-FRAMING THE CAVE IN AN AWKWARD\\nANGLE, CAPTURING SHE, REZA, AND THE WALL SIDEWAYS.\\n\\nShe continues reading the inscriptions.\\n\\nSCARLETT (CONT\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099D)\\nThere\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s more.\\n\\nShe looks around frantically, grabs a rock off the floor.\\n\\nREZA\\nWe have to go!\\n\\nShe hacks away at the inscriptions with the rock, chiseling\\noff chunks of stone with each hit.\\n\\fREZA (CONT'D)\\nWhat are you doing?!\\n\\nSCARLETT\\nThey're going to blow it up anyway!\\n\\nREZA\\nThey\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00991l hear you!

Picks a specific spot marked by\\nan inscribed rose. Takes one more hit and THE WHOLE WALL\\nCOLLAPSES TO THE GROUND revealing --\\n\\nA GIANT STONE STATUE OF A BULL HOLDING A SNAKE IN ITS MOUTH.\\nIT\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099S FACE IS FIERCE, OMINOUS, CREEPY. AND IT\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099S COVERED WITH\\nINSCRIPTIONS.\\n\\nOne glance at it and Scarlett knows what it is.\\nSCARLETT\\nOh my God! Do you know what this\\n\\nis?!\\n\\nIt takes her a moment to snap to. Reza grabs her and\\nphysically tries to escort her away.\\n\\nREZA\\nWe must go!

I have a family.\\n\\nREZA RUNS OFF, LEAVING HER ALONE IN THE CAVE.\\n\\nScarlett whips out a small piece of equipment the size of\\nremote control from a small satchel hidden under her robes.\\n\\fWe hear faint voices on megaphones from down the tunnels.\\nThe small scanner hums to life as it emits a solid line of\\ngreen light. Scarlett begins to methodically blanket the\\nstatue with the laser, scanning it for future study.\\n\\nSCARLETT\\nCome on.\\n\\nThe light creates eerie shadows of the statue on vaulted\\nceilings of the chamber.\\n\\nShe's painfully slow making sure to get every detail of this\\nancient relic. The voices from the megaphones are getting\\nlouder and more foreboding.\\n\\nThe voice in the megaphone seems to be doing a countdown, but\\nin the foreign language, it\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s hard to tell which number it\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s\\ndown to.\\n\\nScarlett knows how close she\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s cutting this, but she won\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t\\nlose this piece of history. She continues swiping the green\\nlaser line from the scanner over every side of the bull.\\nShe's done!\\n\\nShe grabs her headdress and runs like hell.\\n\\nBOOM!\\n\\nA BLACK DUST CLOUD RUSHES PAST SCARLETT, LEAVING HER IN THE\\nDARK IN THE CAVE. SHE COUGHS A COUPLE TIMES, BUT CONTINUES.\\n\\nBOOM!\\nANOTHER BLAST.\\nBOOM!\\n\\nScarlett keeps racing forward, hoping the sounds of\\ncollapsing rock won\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t catch her.\\n\\nShe slams into something.\\n\\nSCARLETT (CONT\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099D)\\nREZA!

Your hands?\\n\\nSCARLETT\\nHe\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s right. This chamber was\\n\\ncreated by master builders.

The door to\\nthe mystical.\\n\\nGEORGE\\nSo it\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s a door?!\\n\\nGeorge grabs a rock and gets ready to chisel at it.\\n\\nSCARLETT\\nNo! Look. That symbol of the door\\non the ceiling is the only thing\\nnot replicated on the floor.\\n\\n76.\\n\\nScarlett shines the light from the rectangle on the ceiling\\n\\ndown to the floor directly beneath it.\\n\\nGEORGE\\nSo?\\nSCARLETT\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cBs above, so below.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d\\nGEORGE\\nSo if...\\nSCARLETT\\nIf they painted a door on the\\nceiling...\\nGEORGE\\nThen there would be a door on the\\nfloor too.\\nLA TAUPE\\n\\nThere is nothing below us. This is\\nthe bottom of the Catacombs.\\n\\nScarlett takes the rock from George. She kneels down in the\\nwater in the gutter at the bottom of the chamber. She hits it\\n\\nwith the rock. Hits it again. And again.\\n\\nCRACK. She looks around at the others as the water drains out\\n\\nof the bottom.\\n\\nGEORGE\\n(to La Taupe)\\nThat water must be going somewhere.\\n\\nScarlett doubles her efforts, hitting the shit out of the\\n\\nrock until.\\n\\nCRACK!\\n\\f77.\\n\\nThe floor of the gutter beneath her gives. She rushes away\\nfrom it as the stones beneath her feet give way and disappear\\noff into nothingness.\\n\\nLA TAUPE\\nThis isn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t catacombs. Look at the\\nedges.

And goes. And goes.\\n\\nScarlett stops. She takes a flashlight and shines it around,\\nlooking at what\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s in front of her.\\n\\nSCARLETT\\nThere\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s a passage down here!\\nINT. THE GATES - CONTINUOUS\\nScarlett places her feet on the ground and looks up to find:\\n\\nA very small opening with a large stone arch over it. It\\nlooks ancient. Very, very ancient.\\n\\nThe others file in behind her.\\nSomething about this space makes them all feel uneasy.\\nScarlett notes the ancient inscriptions on the arch.\\nSCARLETT\\nCan you read that? What does it\\nsay?\\n\\nGeorge dusts it off to get a better look.

ALCHEMIST CHAMBER 2\\n\\nScarlett stands up in the next room to find:\\n\\nIT\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099S EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE ALCHEMIST CHAMBER THAT COLLAPSED\\n\\nON THEM. Same artwork on the ceiling. Same gold. Same missing\\nPhilosopher\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s Stone. Though this room is still intact.\\n\\f79.\\n\\nIt sounds a bit different this side of the threshold.

They\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re facing the\\nother direction.\\n\\nShe's right. This room looks like THE MIRROR IMAGE of the\\nearlier Alchemist Chamber that collapsed on them.\\n\\nLa Taupe turns back, considering his options. He drops to his\\nknees, and digs around furiously looking for something. They\\nfollow his eyes to find what\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s freaking him out - THE SMALL\\nENTRANCE THEY CRAWLED THROUGH SEEMS TO HAVE DISAPPEARED!\\n\\nLA TAUPE\\nWhat happened to the entrance?\\n\\nTHE SMALL ENTRANCE IS GONE.

The figure just keeps muttering to himself.\\nScarlett takes a step toward him. And another.\\n\\nGEORGE\\nWhat are you doing?\\n\\nSCARLETT\\nWe have to pass him.\\n\\nShe's right.

WET HALLWAY 2\\n\\nSplash!\\n\\nShe falls out the other side into the water. She jumps to her\\nfeet, and scans the room looking for anyone who might be in\\nthere.

Memphis holds Calitri's\\n\\twrist, straining, the point inches from his eye\\n\\n\\tANGLE - FLOOR SOCKET - right above Memphis' head. With a last\\n\\tgasp, Memphis misdirects the awl so it STABS THE FLOOR SOCKET - a\\n\\tsmall CLAP OF VOLTAGE shaking through their bodies, as they sprawl\\n\\takimbo ...\\n\\n\\tBoth men are momentarily paralyzed as the electricity sorts itself\\n\\tout inside of them...

But then Memphis grabs him by the hair\\n\\tand tosses Calitri off him ... Memphis POUNDS Calitri's head into\\n\\tthe floor ...\\n\\n\\tOnce, twice. Three times. Calitri is out ...

Dragging the don over to\\n\\n\\tTHE OPEN CASKET - One final burst of strength and Atley drops\\n\\tCalitri into the casket... Slamming the swell top lid of the\\n\\tcoffin.

Now the crucial thing is the\\nbar codes on the label. That's\\nthose little bar codes, you know?\\nThe universal product codes?\\n\\nLENA\\nYeah.\\n\\nBARRY\\nThat's what's used to redeem the\\nmileage, so in noticing the\\npudding, each cup had an individual\\nbar code -- in other words: Two\\ndollars and fifty cents for ten\\ncups of pudding is 500 miles.

The room\\nwithin is panelled with mixrors set at odd angles, and\\nmirrored doors that swing open and close, catching and losing\\nreflections. A row of big crystal chandeliers down the length\\nof the room add myriad prismatic lights to the confusion.\\n\\nA number of Arab men, perhaps as many as twenty, are moving\\n\\nlarge wooden boxes around.

He's talking to someone, smoking a\\ncigarette.\\n\\nAvner's focusing the glasses, bringing Salameh nearer. The\\nsounds of the night intensify, the music, Arabic conversation\\nfrom the house, crickets, the distant surf and Avner\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s own\\nbreathing.\\n\\nSalameh suddenly stops talking, takes a deep drag on his\\ncigarette -- and then he seems to look straight out the\\nfrench doors of the library, out through their panes of\\ndistorting colored glass, out into the dark, as if seeking\\nout and then locking directly with Avner\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s gaze.\\n\\nOne of the mirrored doors behind Salameh opens, then another,\\nthen another, and all at once the face in the binoculars is\\nrepeated, over and over, full face, profile, rear view,\\nstaring hard at something -- it seems to be Avner -- with a\\nstrange expression: familiarity, hatred, taunting.\\n\\nCUT BACK TO236\\n\\nSTEVE\\nToo many Men.

His body topples back into the bushes.\\n\\nAvner and Steve hear shouts coming from inside the house.\\nSomeone in the dining room flings the door opens and calls\\nout something in Arabic. They crouch, edging back into the\\nshadows. Suddenly there's a burst of machine-gun fire,\\nsending stone and gravel and dirt flying.\\n\\nSteve starts to run back towards the shore. Avner catches\\nhis arm, spins him around and drags him in the opposite\\ndirection. Avner runs in this direction, and Steve follows.\\n\\nAs they approach the main gates Avner trips, stumbles,\\ncutting his face. He sits there, stunned.

The\\ngates burst open, and Avner and Steve run pell-mell down the\\ndrive. Noises of pursuit, running, shouting, from within the\\ncompound grow closer. There's a burst of gunfire nearby.\\nAvner and Steve run down the road at top speed.\\n\\nNo one is pursuing. They keep running.\\n\\nCLOSE UP:\\nAvner runs, as we'd seen him at the start of the sequence:\\nface blacked, bloody cut, sweat, terror. He plunges into the\\ngrass field.
